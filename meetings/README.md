# Meetings 

Meetings are scheduled every other Wednesday at 1pm US Pacific Time and are open to anyone interested in participating in the project. You can follow the TAC discussions by signing up for the [TAC email list](https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac).

You can review past meeting notes below and the [calendar of meetings](https://lists.aswf.io/calendar).

For the next TAC meeting, you can propose agenda items either [via email to the TAC](mailto:tac@lists.aswf.io), or as a pull request against [those meeting notes](/meetings).

There is a [template](template.md) file in here for creating the upcoming meeting agenda. Note that there is a required metadata section at the top that must be present in order the meeting notes to show in the right place.
