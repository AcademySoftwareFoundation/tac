# Agenda & Notes

## Previous Action Items

### Getting started documentation for ASWF CI (JF)

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iS68VMIgT4skfoHbta3hExE64uu6XVJLATxighqkd4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iS68VMIgT4skfoHbta3hExE64uu6XVJLATxighqkd4)

Apologies for poor formatting, a lot of this came from a MarkDown document.

### Packer config to build VFX Reference Platform (Aloys)

Update of base image with Red Hat Developer Tools which provides the compiler specified by the VFX Reference Platform.

### CMakeTools license (Daniel)

Discussions in TAC meeting and CI working group have been inconclusive.  Kimball and John are regrouping to find a practical solution (see CMakeTools notes below).

# ASWF TAC Goals for Year 1

* 6 projects, including CMakeTools?

    * JF: See Sam Richardâ€™s industry OSS summary (posted to TAC list)

* VFX Reference Platform based dependencies

* Stretch goals:  

    * Downloadable and installable artefacts

    * Windows, Mac support

        * Doug Walker: OCIO would value Windows, Mac and GPU highly

* **Action Item: Follow up with Vendors to see if they can contribute experience and expertise.**

# Sonar Qube for CII Badge

* Streamline project adoption

* C/C++ analysis plugin requires a commercial license

    * Would need to budget for this (refer to TAC)

    * This creates an infrastructure replication challenge

    * [https://github.com/mre/awesome-static-analysis](https://github.com/mre/awesome-static-analysis) seems to have an interesting survey of static analysis tools sorted by programming language

# CMakeTools

* Updates:   [https://github.com/kdt3rd/build-util](https://github.com/kdt3rd/build-util)

* Including VFX Reference Platform logic

    * Simple mechanism for cross-project package discovery and inclusion

* Attempt to separate liberally licensed (MIT?) or public domain sharable snippets from the core repo under standard (Apache v2?) license

# Integration with Commercial Applications

* Build / Distribution of same or "updated" components / plugins used and distributed with commercial DCC Apps

* **Action Item: Establish ways to identify and make reproducible builds of the shipping versions of components?**

# Next Steps

* Follow up meeting: 12 December

* Google Docs export to MarkDown: https://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md
