    - At Netflix studios
  - Membership Drive [#1275](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/issues/1275)
    - David: a yearlong effort, will come back from time to time. Membership drive is going well, lots of meetings. No action items for TAC, but if you meet companies showing interest, ask "Any interest in joining ASWF" please refer them to me.
  - Dev Days 2026 [#1288](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/issues/1288)
    - May 14th, Sept 17
    - John: projects need to go through backlog, label good first issues, getting started docs. TAC representatives, get connected inside your company, get positioned as stake holder. When there's someone in the org who can be center contact, helps everyone in the company to participate.
    - Olga: if anyone has questions, please come to me. We've expanded our team, we have an internal outreach coordinator, she'll be helping with project side of things. Her name is Prajna (sp?). Hopefully this year there will be more support for projects and companies. If anyone knows someone who wants to coordinate for a company, send them my way.

    - Collaborations have been in private, by joining ASWF we can make those public
  - Thank you!
  - Open Discussion
    - Michael: timeframe for MaterialX? Jon: in progress for about a year, but we are a small team. Making great progress, hope to start testing internally soon. Not merged in main branch yet. Will be in next open source release. MoonRay is not an OSL renderer, our shaders are pre-compiled, we're implementing full MaterialX in MoonRay.
    - JF: do you work off the public repo? Jon: currently all main developement is done internally, we push updates to public quarterly, going forward we don't have a good answer yet. Discussing what would be the best approach, ideally we would be working off the public codebase. We have moved deeply to increase our external updates to match our internal updates. Matthew: we have a set of regressions tests working on production data, removing Dreamworks IP to be able to run validation on public GitHub, that was a blocker. Once we can run tests to verify stability for production, that will help to target the open source version. Larry (chat): Most projects find that it's an anti-pattern to develop in a non-public branch.
    - JF: excited about the "canary app" that calls most other ASWF apps for CI.
    - Cary: mentioned a TSC chair. Do you have non-Dreamworks contributors signed on? Randy: not yet, starting to make the outreach. Hasn't been a priority since we open source, we've been working on automating our procedures, but we've started probing. So not yet, but we're doing the outreach. Matthew: we're hopeful that joining ASWF can diversify our outreach. That will help us expand the TSC. Cary: a natural evolution of the projects. The step of moving into ASWF is the time to bring in more contributors, we hope our projects are truly communally supported, not just tightly held by a single organization. But there is a chicken and egg. John (chat): I could also see the project in a vendor-neutral governance will help increase contributions; this was a big gap in early projects like OpenVDB, where it was really hard to contribute to these projects which were owned by specific studios and being an external contributor was very hard to do.
    - Gordon: can you talk more about what you hope to change by moving into ASWF? It's already on GitHub, you already have an ASWF like governance model today. Other than visibility, what do you hope to get / problems you can solve? We want to know what kind of support / engagement. Randy: there's a number of benefits, general ASWF mission statement of a "neutral home" helping collaboration. Also established procedures, engaging with projects, for instance OpenPBR, MaterialX. Until now a lot of our learnings have been us going at it alone. Matthew: nothing has prevented us from being more engaged, it's been more challenging on our own. Some of the CI plans will help, Mac / Windows support, see how other projects have been doing things. Gordon: there's a correlation between contribution and adoption. Neutral home is important, are there studios looking at adopting where a neutral home would help? Randy: not that specifically, but some people making slow inroads. A neutral home would help. There are private conversations that happen, we also have analytics, significant interest that is more important than what people are saying publicly. But we can only benefit. Matthew: some studios have said that being part of ASWF would help with adoption.
    - Cary: you would surrender a certain amount of ownership / control. So you need to be prepared with the situation where other contributors may want to take the project in a different direction than Dreamworks. Matthew: yes, we understand that. Randy: it's like having a variety of productions with different "look" requirements. We already have some experience there.
    - Jonathan: want to highlight advantages of a reference implementation of a production renderer. Also a way to validate OpenUSD / MaterialX renders. We'd be excited about that. Previously we've thought about ways to build something from scratch, would be great to shift effort to an existing, open source production renderer. Would be great if MoonRay could support all parts of ASWF stack, including OSL, even if not ideal from performance perspective. Would be very powerful, and might simplify USD / MaterialX rendering framework. Excited about the possibilities!
    - John: from a TAC perspective, do we need to have more discussions, or are we ready for offline vote? Cary: discussion is more "how" to execute rather than "whether". We should move to vote. Michael: do we have quorum? John: best to do offline, any issues? Larry: not voicing opposition, but everyone should feel it's OK to discuss more. We don't want to push this down everyone's throat. Randy: happy to answer any additional questions.
    - John: if anyone has a concern. Eric: we could discuss in person for more discussions. John: hold the vote after that? Eric: would suggest after that. Cary: could be a nice thing to announce in person. Michael: we can also express in the vote. Cary: DreamWorks is such a core member of ASWF, and this is a mature project, chance that we would say "no" seems really slim. Major questions are just around working the details, not blockers / obstacles. John: will get vote going, quorum will show whether we need to talk in person.
    - Matthew: works for us!
