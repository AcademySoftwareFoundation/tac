# ASWF Google Summer of Code 2020

The mission of the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) is to increase the
quality and quantity of contributions to the content creation industry's
open source software base; to provide a neutral forum to coordinate
cross-project efforts; to provide a common build and test infrastructure;
and to provide individuals and organizations a clear path to participation
in advancing our open source ecosystem.

Member projects are focused primarily on visual effects and animation
production, and at present include 5 distinct software packages. Student
summer project applications can be for any of these packages individually,
as well as potentially including tasks that bridge between them or provide
common infrastructure (they share CI and other resources). The current
member projects are:

* **OpenColorIO** : A complete color management solution geared towards
  motion picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer
  animation.

* **OpenCue** : A render management / job queueing system you can deploy for
  visual effects and animation productions.

* **OpenEXR** : The specification and reference implementation of the EXR
  file format, the professional-grade image storage format of the motion
  picture industry.

* **OpenTimelineIO** : API and interchange format for editorial timeline
  information.

* **OpenVDB** : Hierarchical data structure and a suite of tools for the
  efficient storage and manipulation of sparse volumetric data.


## Application Instructions for Students

Please familiarize yourself with the several software projects under our
organization. The individual projects are listed below with their home
pages, GitHub repositories, and a list of possible projects.

You may choose a summer task from any of our software projects. It is also
permissible to propose (a) a task that is common infrastructure shared by
the projects, such as with our CI system; (b) a task that crosses project
boundaries or involves two projects; (c) a task that is technically in a
non-ASWF code base but for which our organization is an appropriate mentor
(as an illustrative example: adding comprehensive OpenColorIO support to a
widely used open source project).

All of our projects maintain their own CONTRIBUTING guidelines, please read
them for the project you are interested in. They each also have separate
contributor license agreements (CLAs) which must be signed for them to
accept contributions.

**Successfully submitting a Pull Request to the ASWF software project you are
applying to is a strict requirement prior to submitting an application.**
This is not negotiable. We will not even read applications from students who
have not submitted an acceptable PR to the project they are applying to
participate in. It can be a truly minimal change -- for example, fixing a
typo in an error message. The purpose of this requirement is to prove that
you already have the skills to set up a GitHub login, successfully clone the
project, build it, make a change, submit a PR, and interact with the
community for code review.

In addition to ideas listed below, the GitHub "Issues" page for each project
will have issues tagged "GSoC" if they seem like an appropriate size for a a
GSoC summer project. You will also see many issues tagged "good first
issue", those might be ideal candidates for your small trial PR to qualify
for application.

Individual project's developer mail lists can be found here:

## Application template

Please use this application template. You don't have to stick precisely to
this, feel free to expand or tell us any other relevant details, but this is
a good place to start.

The applications will be judged both by the individual leadership teams of
the software project you propose to work on, as well as representatives of
the ASWF technical advisory council.
