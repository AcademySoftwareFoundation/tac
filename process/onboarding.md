# New Project Onboarding

* TOC
{:toc}

Once the {{ site.foundation_name }} TAC approves a project, the LF Staff will work with the project to onboard on to the tools and service provided and support a marketing launch. The onboarding process is outlined in an email that will be sent to the project shortly after the project is accepted by the TAC, and is also outlined below so new projects know what to expect.

## Collaboration Tools

{{ site.foundation_name }} has several standard collaboration tools for projects to use.

- [Mailing Lists]({{ site.mailing_list_url }}) - {{ site.foundation_name }} by default sets up projects with a public and private email list. Additional mailing lists can be provisioned by the LF Staff if needed. Please review the [guidelines for mailing list management]({% link tools/mailing_lists.md %})
- [{{ site.foundation_name }} Slack]({{ site.slack_url }}) - {{ site.foundation_name }} by default sets up projects with a public Slack channel; additional channels can be setup upon request.

The project may use other collaboration tools, but the LF Staff will not support these. {{ site.foundation_name }} does require ownership access to any third-party tools. Funding is unavailable for third-party collaboration tools if a standard collaboration tool outlined above is available.

## LFX

LFX provides numerous tools for projects that reduce operational overhead and provide insights into the projects' activities. The LF Staff will automatically onboard projects to these tools.

- [LFX Project Control Center](https://projectadmin.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) for managing committees and meetings for the project. The LF Staff will provide the initial setup, and projects can refer to the [collaboration tools guidance]({% link tools/collaboration.md %}) on how to use this tool.
- [LFX Insights](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) to better understand project contributions and velocity. 
- [LFX EasyCLA](https://easycla.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) if a project uses a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) as a part of its IP Policy.

## Kickoff TSC meeting

The LF Staff will coordinate, schedule, and run the first Technical Steering Committee (TSC) meeting. The first meeting generally includes:

- Welcome and introductions
- Role of the TSC
- Chairperson selection
- Review outstanding onboarding tasks
- Cadence for future meetings

## OpenSSF Best Practices badge

The [{{ site.foundation_name }} Project Lifecycle]({% link process/lifecycle.md %}) requires projects to achieve an [OpenSSF Best Practices badge](https://www.bestpractices.dev/) as part of moving through the lifecycle. The project should use the online tool to add their project, and the LF Staff can assist with guidance on meeting the badge requirements.

## New Project Announcement

The {{ site.foundation_name }} Marketing team partners with each new project to help them announce their project joining {{ site.foundation_name }} and setup the core marketing collateral materials. This includes...

- Designing a project logo and adding it to the [artwork repository]({{ site.artwork_url }}). If there is an existing project logo that the project wishes to continue to use, we can add that to the [artwork repository]({{ site.artwork_url }}).
- Adding the project to the [{{ site.foundation_name }} website]({{ site.website_url }}), along with a dedicated landing page for the project.
- Adding the project to the [{{ site.foundation_name }} landscape]({{ site.landscape_url }}).
- Including a slide on the project in the {{ site.foundation_name }} overview deck.

All marketing requests can be made [here]({{ site.helpdesk_url }}).

{{ site.foundation_name }} is committed to supporting hosted projects and other initiatives to ensure their success. If a project needs any assistance, don't hesitate to reach out via our [support site]({{ site.helpdesk_url }}).
