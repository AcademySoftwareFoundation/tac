# ASWF Working Groups
_Modeled off of CNCF Working Group model ( https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/workinggroups/README.md )_

The purpose of working groups are to study and report on a particular question and make recommendations based on it's findings. The end result of a working group may be a new project proposal, landscape, whitepaper or even a report detailing it's findings. The intention of working groups is not to host a full project or specification. Working Groups can be formed at any time but must be sponsored by a [TAC member] and with an affirmative vote of the ASWF TAC. The TAC can also shut down a working group with a super majority vote.

## Forming a working group

Interested parties in forming a working groups should align with the interested parties on the [charter template]. Once the working group charter is agreed upon, and a [TAC member] is identified as a sponsor, it should be shared with the [TAC email list] to be added to the agenda for the next TAC meeting for review and approval. A working group will not be designated and recognized as an official ASWF Working Group until the TAC approves the charter.

## Working Group activities and collaboration

Working groups generally will meet on a regular basis and operate in an open and transparent way. ASWF provides working groups access to Zoom, a mailing list, Slack channel, wiki space, and GitHub repo. Please submit a [request on the foundation repo](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/foundation/issues/new) to have this infrastructure created.

Working groups should operate within the scope of the mission, goals, non-goals, and deliverables listed in the approved charter. Any changes in scope must be reflected in the working group charter and approved by the TAC.

## Review

Working Groups will present to the TAC it's progress towards the mission, goals, non-goals, and deliverables listed in the approved charter after 6 months from when the working group was formally approved. This is an opportunity for the working group to elevate any concerns or needs from the TAC to complete it's mission, goals, non-goals, and deliverables. If there is insufficent progress within the working group, the TAC may opt to close the working group with a 2/3 majority vote of [TAC member]s.

After one year, the working group is expected to have completed the mission, goals, non-goals, and deliverables listed in the approved charter. If the working group has not completed it's mission, goals, non-goals, and deliverables, and it's of the opinion of the TAC that it can be completed, the TAC may opt to extend the working group for up to 1 year with a 2/3 majority vote of [TAC member]s.
