# Hosted project success metrics

## Overview

This document is intended to capture best practices for ASWF hosted projects to measure project success. It is by no means an exclusive list of success metrics, but intended as a starting point for projects to this about success along with a guide for establish some degree of commonality between projects.

## What is Project Success

A project's definition of success will change over time, and as such, measures of success will need to shift over time as well. 

For most projects, a good place to start is with the founding project team defining what a success looks like to them at the early, MVP, v1, and LTS stages of the project, and some suggested KPI's are listed below. 

In the early stages, a high velocity of commits sustained over months may be a good indicator for your project.  In LTS, this level of activity has likely tapered off, and that's not a bad thing. 

## Metrics for Project Success

Some good KPI's to consider at the start of your project include: 

+ How many contributors do we have?
+ How many maintainers do we have?
+ How many downstream dependencies are there? 
+ How many users of the software do we have?
+ How many bugs do we have?
+ How long does it take for a bug to be fixed?
+ How long are PR's sitting open?

## Tools for measursing Project Success

There are some good open source tools for measuring open source project health that include: 
https://github.com/chaoss (and the GrimoireLab and Augur projects within it) and some ideas on types of measurement and dashboards available can be seen at https://bitergia.com/products/dashboards/ where they have a commercial product based on CHAOSS.
