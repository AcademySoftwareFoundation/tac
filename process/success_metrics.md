# Hosted project success metrics

## Overview

This document is intended to capture best practices for ASWF hosted projects to measure project success. It is by no means an exclusive list of success metrics, but intended as a starting point for projects to this about success along with a guide for establish some degree of commonality between projects.

## What is Project Success

Defining project success is a collaborative effort, but usually derived from the project leads or founders. Widely viewed, a succcessful Open Source project is one that there is continued contribution to, and value derived from.  Some example metrics for consideration by project teams are listed below.

## Metrics for Project Success
(from: https://opensource.com/article/19/8/measure-project) The below metrics are defined by development role in an Open Source project.

        Metric: Number of contributors.

        How is velocity changing over time?
        Metric: Percent change of code over time.
        Metric: Time between pull request, code review, and merge.

    How diverse & inclusive is my project?

        Do we have a valid, public, Code of Conduct (CoC)?
        Metric: CoC repository file check.

        Are events associated with my project actively inclusive?
        Metric: Manual reporting on event ticketing policies and event inclusion activities.

        Does our project do a good job of being accessible?
        Metric: Validation of typed meeting minutes being posted.
        Metric: Validation of closed captioning used during meetings.
        Metric: Validation of color-blind-accessible materials in presentations and in project front-end designs.

    How much value does my project represent?

        How can I help organizations understand how much time and money using our project would save them (labor investment)
        Metric: Repo count of issues, commits, pull requests, and the estimated labor rate.

        How can I understand the amount of downstream value my project creates and how vital (or not) it is to the wider community to maintain my project?
        Metric: Repo count of how many other projects rely on my project.

        How much opportunity is there for those contributing to my project to use what they learn working on it to land good jobs and at what organizations (aka living wage)?
        Metric: Count of organizations using or contributing to this library.
        Metric: Averages of salaries for developers working with this kind of project.
        Metric: Count of job postings with keywords that match this project.

Project maintainers

As a Project Maintainer, I care most about:

    Am I an efficient maintainer?
    Metric: Time PR’s wait before a code review.
    Metric: Time between code review and subsequent PR’s.
    Metric: How many of my code reviews are approvals?
    Metric: How many of my code reviews are rejections/rework requests?
    Metric: Sentiment analysis of code review comments.

    How do I get more people to help me maintain this thing?
    Metric: Count of social reach of project contributors.

    Is our code quality getting better or worse over time?
    Metric: Count how many regressions are being introduced over time.
    Metric: Count how many bugs are being introduced over time.
    Metric: Time between bug filing, pull request, review, merge, and release.

Project developers and contributors

As a project developer or contributor, I care most about:

    What things of value can I gain from contributing to this project and how long might it take to realize that value?
    Metric: Downstream value.
    Metric: Time between commits, code reviews, and merges.

    Are there good prospects for using what I learn by contributing to increase my job opportunities?
    Metric: Living wage.

    How popular is this project?
    Metric: Counts of social media posts, shares, and favorites.

    Do community influencers know about my project?
    Metric: Social reach of founders, maintainers, and contributors.
