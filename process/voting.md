# Voting Processes

* TOC
{:toc}

While the {{ site.foundation_name }} aims to drive decision-making by consensus; from time to time, voting is needed to ratify key actions or resolve decisions where there is contention. This document outlines when voting is required and the process for doing so.

It is the role of the TAC Chairperson to determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the TAC Voting Represenatatives and nature of support and objections. The TAC Chairperson will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements. 

This voting process applies to the TAC specifically, but TSCs should look at this for inspiration for thier own processes. The document is also meant to add clarity to any stipulations listed in the [Academy Software Foundation Directed Fund Charter][ASWF Charter]. 

The LF Staff will assist as needed to help resolve any voting concerns and questions, and faciliate voting as needed.

## When voting is required

Voting is only required in these cases:

- Approving and renewing Industry Representatives to the TAC
- Approving new projects or working group
- Approving annual reviews
- Approving projects moving a lifecycle stage
- Changes to [Project Lifecycle](/process/lifecycle.html) or [Working Group program](/process/working_groups/)
- Any other decisions where a consensus cannot be achieved.

## Voting Process

Voting can occur either within a regular TAC meeting, or electronically using the [LFX PCC Voting Tool](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/project-control-center/v2-latest-version/collaborations/voting).

### In meeting voting

The TAC Chairperson can make a deterimination if a vote is appropriate, and can make or ask for a call for a vote. The general flow would work as follows:

- Ask for a motion
- Once a motion is recieved, ask for a second
- Once a second is recieved, open the vote.
- First, ask for those in support of the vote. Individual can vote by saying "Aye" or using the appropriate reaction in Zoom to indicate their support.
- Once it is determined that all the votes for those in favor have come in, ask if anyone wishes to oppose or abstain.
- If there are abstantions, record those with the voting results.
- If there are opposing votes, allow those individuals to voice thier concerns. The TAC Chairperson may determine if it is appropriate to suspend the vote due to the concerns raised.

### Electronic voting

If during a regular TAC meeting a quorum is not achieved, or if after discussions outside of a regular TAC meeting the TAC Chairperson determines it is appropriate to conduct a vote, the vote will be conducted via the [LFX PCC Voting Tool](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/project-control-center/v2-latest-version/collaborations/voting). Votes can be case for, against, and as abstantions.

If there are opposing votes, the TAC Chairperson may determine if it is appropriate to suspend the vote and continue the discussion in a regular TAC meeting.
