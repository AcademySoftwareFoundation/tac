# Voting Processes

* TOC
{:toc}

While the {{ site.foundation_name }} aims to drive decision-making by consensus; from time to time, voting is needed to ratify key actions or resolve decisions where there is contention. This document outlines when voting is required and the process for doing so.

{: .note }
The TAC Chairperson's role is to determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of several factors, including the dominant view of the TAC Voting Representatives and the nature of support and objections. The Chairperson will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements. 

{: .note }
This voting process applies specifically to the TAC, but TSCs should use it as inspiration for their own processes. The document is also meant to clarify any stipulations listed in the [{{ site.foundation_name }} Directed Fund Charter]({{ site.directed_fund_charter_url }}). 

{: .note }
The LF Staff will assist as needed to resolve any voting concerns and questions and facilitate voting.

## When voting is required

Voting is only required in these cases:

- Approving and renewing Industry Representatives to the TAC
- Approving new projects or working group
- Approving annual reviews
- Approving projects moving a lifecycle stage
- Changes to [Project Lifecycle]({% link process/lifecycle.md %}) or [Working Group program]({% link process/working_groups/README.md %})
- Any other decisions where a consensus cannot be achieved.

## Voting Process

Voting can occur either within a regular TAC meeting or electronically using the [LFX PCC Voting Tool](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/project-control-center/v2-latest-version/collaborations/voting).

### In meeting voting

The TAC Chairperson can decide if a vote is appropriate and can make or ask for a call for a vote. The general flow would work as follows:

- Ask for a motion
- Once a motion is received, ask for a second
- Once a second is received, open the vote.
First, ask for those who support the vote. Individuals can vote by saying "Aye" or using the appropriate reaction in Zoom to indicate their support.
- Once it is determined that all the votes for those in favor have come in, ask if anyone wishes to oppose or abstain.
- If there are abstentions, record those with the voting results.
- If there are opposing votes, allow those individuals to voice their concerns. The TAC Chairperson may determine if it is appropriate to suspend the vote due to the concerns raised.

### Electronic voting

If a quorum is not achieved during a regular TAC meeting, or if after discussions outside of a regular TAC meeting, the TAC Chairperson determines it is appropriate to conduct a vote, the vote will be conducted via the [LFX PCC Voting Tool](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/project-control-center/v2-latest-version/collaborations/voting). Votes can be case for, against, or as abstentions.

If opposing votes are present, the TAC Chairperson may determine whether suspending the vote is appropriate and continue the discussion in a regular TAC meeting.
