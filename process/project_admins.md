# Project Admins

A project admin is a TSC committer that has been granted GitHub administrative
permissions. This gives the individual the right to change certain repository
settings without needing to submit Linux Foundation Service Desk tickets. By
default TSC committers have GitHub write permissions.

As GitHub admininstrative permissions provide full access, project admins agree
not to perform these sensitive and destructive actions:

* Delete or archive the repository
* Transfer the repository out of the ASWF organization
* Change the repository visibility
* Disable or downgrade the DCO signoff PR check from mandatory to optional
* Disable or downgrade the CLA PR check from mandatory to optional
* Merge a pull request to a protected branch where either the DCO signoff or
  CLA checks have failed
* Force push to a protected branch where either the DCO signoff or CLA checks
  have failed or have not yet been performed

Being given and retaining these permissions is at the discretion of the Linux
Foundation Release Engineering team.
