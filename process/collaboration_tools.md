# Academy Software Foundation community collaboration tools

Academy Software Foundation maintains a number of tools to enable collaboration amongst community participants. To help navigate these tools, this document provides a brief outline of how to use them and best practices.

## Slack

Academy Software Foundation hosts a Slack organization, which can be joined using the SlackIn joiner at https://slack.aswf.io ( note some projects use a seperate Slack instance, most notably [OpenColorIO](http://slack.opencolorio.org/), but follow these same guidelines ). Slack serves as the main communication platform for the Academy Software Foundation community outside of the mailing lists. Itâ€™s important that conversations stays on topic in each channel, and that everyone abides by the [Code of Conduct]. There are thousands of members who should all expect to have a positive experience.

Chat is searchable and public. Do not make comments that you would not say on a video recording or in another public space. Please be courteous to others.

Slack also maintains some [best practice etiquette](https://slackhq.com/etiquette-tips-in-slack), which has some great basic usage tips and other recommendations to best collaborate and communicate with others.

Slack as a medium is best suited for short-term and synchronous conversations; long-term conversations and tracking of actions and plans are better suited for mailing lists, wikis, GitHub, and other similar mediums.

### DM (Direct Message) Conversations

Please do not engage in proprietary company specific conversations in the Academy Software Foundation Slack instance. This workspace is meant for conversations related to Academy Software Foundation topics and community. Proprietary conversations should occur in your company Slack and/or communication platforms.  As with all communication, please be mindful of appropriateness, professionalism, and applicability to the Academy Software Foundation community.

### Specific Channel Rules

Some channels have specific rules or guidelines. If they do, they will be listed
in the purpose or pinned docs of that channel.

### Escalating and/or Reporting a Problem

If you encounter an issue using the Academy Software Foundation Slack, please contact the [Academy Software Foundation Program Director].

### Requesting a Channel

To add a channel, please [submit a request].

Some general guidelines on new channels...

  - Channels should be dedicated to sub-projects, community topics, or related Academy Software Foundation programs/projects.
  - Linking to resources will speed in the validation and processing of the channel creation request.
  - Channels are **NOT**:
    - Company specific
    - Private channels with the exception of: code of conduct matters, mentoring,
      security/vulnerabilities, github management, or steering committee.
  - Special accommodations will be made where necessary.

### Requesting a Bot, Token, or Webhook

**READ BEFORE SUBMITTING A REQUEST**

Bots, tokens, and webhooks are reviewed on a case-by-case basis with most requests being rejected due to security, privacy, and usability concerns. Bots and the like tend to make a lot of noise in channels. The Academy Software Foundation Slack instance has thousands of members and it is crucial to ensure everyone has a great experience.

Typically approved requests include: GitHub, tool requests, or other tools/platforms used to aid in the management of Slack itself. Please [submit a request] to have this reviewed.

## Mailing lists

Academy Software Foundation maintains a number of mailing lists for the foundation itself, its members, and the community at large. These mailing lists are hosted at [groups.io](https://groups.io) and managed by the Linux Foundation staff and Academy Software Foundation community leadership.

### Key mailing lists

The primary mailing list for all techincal community discussion is [tac@lists.aswf.io](https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac). Each hosted project and working group has its own mailing list as well, which are [listed in the project listing in the TAC repo](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac#tac-projects).

### Moderation and Moderation Guidelines

By default, TSC voting members serve as the moderator for discussions in [tac@lists.aswf.io](https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac), and each hosted project's TSC will serve as moderator for its mailing lists. Moderation privledges can be extended to others upon a vote by the TAC or respective TSC as applicable.

Being a moderator is as much a privledge as it is a duty. As part of volunteering to become a moderator you are now a representative of the Academy Software Foundation community, and it is your responsibility to remain aware of your contributions in this space. These responsibilities apply to all official Academy Software Foundation channels.

Moderators MUST:

- Take action as specified by these Moderator Guidelines.
  - You are empowered to take immediate action when there is a violation. You do not need to wait for review or approval if an egregious violation has occurred. Make a judgement call based on our Code of Conduct and Values (see below).
  - Removing a bad actor or content from the medium is required, do NOT let it sit there.
- Abide by the documented tasks and actions required of moderators.
- Ensure that the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) is in effect on all official Academy Software Foundation channels.
- Make yourself generally available during working hours in your time zone for moderation. This can be handled as a group so that there is enough coverage of people to allow for absences/travel.
- Take care of spam as soon as possible, which may mean taking action by removing a member from that resource.
- Foster a safe and productive environment by being aware of potential multiple cultural differences between community members.
- Understand that you might be contacted by moderators, community managers, and other users via private email or a direct message.
- Keep up with software/platform changes on the property they are responsible for. This might include new UI changes, new features, or other software changes. Moderators are encouraged to meet regularly to train themselves how to be proficient with the platform.
- Report violations of the [Code of Conduct] to pm@aswf.io.

Moderators SHOULD:

- Exercise compassion and empathy when communicating and collaborating with other community members.
- Understand the difference between a user abusing the resource or just having difficulty expressing comments and questions in English.
- Be an example and role model to others in the community. In many cases, moderators are some of the first people new contributors will interact with.
- Remember to check and recognize if you need take a break when you become frustrated or find yourself in a heated debate.
- Help your colleagues if you recognize them in one of the stages of burnout.
- Be helpful and have fun!

### Mailing list best practices

- Review your mailing list subscriptions regularly, and either change the delivery mechanism ( such as switching from indivudual emails to daily digests ) as it makes sense to keep the signal-to-noise level reasonable for you.
- Keep your comments and conversation on topic.
- Recognize that with a global community and other obligations, replies aren't instantaneous.
  - Refrain from cross-posting as a way to get a larger audience to your post.
- Be sure to contact the list moderators if there are any [Code of Conduct] concerns.

## Calendars

You can stay subscribed to the meetings of the projects and committees of the Academy Software Foundation by subscribing to the coordinating mailing list. Each mailing list has a calendar which you can subscribe to you with your calendar client of choice.

By default, the following permissions apply to calendars:

- Voting TAC members can manage the [tac calendar].
- TSC project chairpersons can manage their respective project calendars.
- LF Staff can manage any calendar event.

If you are running into an issue with calendar events, please [submit a request] and the LF Staff can help.

### Calendar guidance

To help individuals to not be inundated with calendar overload, try to follow these guidelines:

- The [tac calendar] should only be used for TAC meetings, meetings or events for the full ASWF community, and kickoff meetings of new projects.
- Specific project meetings should be on your project's calendar. All meeting should be on the primary discussion, dev, or user calendar unless it's a specific closed meeting to discuss a sensitive topic.
- Avoid making any meeting invite changes ( including cancellations or reschedulings ) less that 24 hours in advance, as many calendaring clients do not update immediately. It's also best practice to email that calendar's respective mailing list to inform the group of the cancellation.
- If you are rescheduling a meeting, cancel the previous one and issue a new meeting instead of doing a reschedule. Some calendaring clients don't do well with meeting invite changes.

### Calendar management best practices

- Do ensure that any meeting invites have clearly identified web conference or location details.
  - Unless the meeting is only in person, always provide a web conference for those who can't attend in person
- Be sure the description of the meeting has an agenda or a link to the agenda of the meeting.
- Since calendaring clients can not always be good at managing changes...
  - If a meeting is to be rescheduled, delete the original meeting invite and add a new one with a title denoting it being rescheduled.
  - Avoid cancelling meetings within 24 hours of the meeting
  - For changes/cancellations, email the invitees as well to inform them of the cancellation
  - When provisioning a new series of recurring meetings, instruct invitees to remove old entries manually.
- Courtesy Email, as a meeting lead it is a best practice to email the applicable sub-group with a note about any new meetings available, any meeting changes, or meeting cancellations.
