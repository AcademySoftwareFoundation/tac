# Contributor License Agreement (CLA) FAQ

Many of the projects hosted by ASWF leverage a Contributor License Agreement for contributors to the given project. These projects use [EasyCLA](https://lfcla.com/) for automating the process of signing and managing CLAs for the project. 

This document captures some commonly asked questions by organizations on CLAs and using the EasyCLA system.

Q: Why does the project require me to sign a CLA?

A: It depends from project to project, but generally the project is looking to ensure that each indivudual is properly authorized to contribute to the project ( most specifically by thier employer ) and that any additional terms that a contributor should be bound to.

Q: What is the difference between a Corporate and Individual CLA?

A: The Corporate CLA is designed for an organization to authorize contributors that have permission to contribute on behalf of the organization. The Individual CLA is specific for an indivudual contributor, including those not affliated with an organization.

Q: Who needs to sign the Corporate CLA?

A: The Corporate CLA should be signed by someone with signatory rights in your organization. This might be an executive or legal council, but you should always consult your leadership to confirm.

Q: What is a CLA Manager?

A: A CLA Manager is the person or are the persons in your organization that are authorized by the signatory of the Corporate CLA to authorize contributors from your organization. This often is a development manager or team lead who is overseeing the contributions being made to a given project.
