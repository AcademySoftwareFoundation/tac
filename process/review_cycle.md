# Annual Reviews

The TAC will review all projects within this lifecycle on an annual basis. 

The purpose of the TAC Review is to gauge whether the project is still at the correct maturity stage based on the criteria for the current stage, as well as identify any concerns or feedback from the project's TSC that the {{ site.foundation_name }} can help address.

Projects will schedule their annual review as part of the next TAC meeting following the anniversary of the projectâ€™s acceptance. Projects should prepare a short presentation that covers the following points, which the TAC will use in its review of the project:

- The current activity of the project, including releases, adoption, and committer/contribution growth and diversity.
- Assessment of whether the project is fulfilling the requirements to remain at its current stage or be considered for a different stage.
- Feedback on its experience as an {{ site.foundation_name }} project, including benefits from being an {{ site.foundation_name }} project and areas that the TAC and {{ site.foundation_name }} staff can better support the project.

Projects should use the [annual review template](annual_review_template.pptx) to structure their presentation.

Projects may request to move to the next lifecycle stage as part of their annual review. To do so, the project should notify the TAC at least two days before the TAC meeting they are scheduled to present at, adding a comment on the annual review GitHub issue.

If the TAC deems the project not meeting the current stage's requirements, it may vote to move the project to the appropriate or {{ site.archived_lifecycle_stage }} stage. The project may choose to move outside of {{ site.foundation_name }} at any time.
