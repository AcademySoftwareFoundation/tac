# Project Review Cycle

The TAC will review on an annual basis all projects within this lifecycle. Additionally, Sandbox Stage projects must submit quarterly progress reports towards the Incubation Stage.

The purpose of the TAC Review is to gauge whether the project is still at the correct maturity stage based on the criteria for the current stage, as well as identify any concerns or feedback from the project's TSC that the Academy Software Foundation can help address.

Projects will schedule their annual review as part of the next TAC meeting following the anniversary of the projectâ€™s acceptance. Projects should prepare a short presentation that covers the following points, which the TAC will use in its review of the project:

*   The current activity of the project, including releases, adoption, and committer/contribution growth and diversity.
*   Assessment of whether the project is fulfilling the requirements to remain at its current stage or be considered for a different stage.
*   Feedback on its experience as an Academy Software Foundation project, including benefits from being an Academy Software Foundation project and areas that the TAC and Academy Software Foundation staff can better support the project.

Projects should use the [annual review template](annual_review_template.pptx) to structure thier presentation.

Annual reviews require an affirmative majority vote of the TAC for the project to continue at the current stage or the appropriate number of votes as outlined for each stage in this document to move to the next stage. If the TAC deems the project does not meet the current stage's requirements, it may vote to move it to the appropriate or Archived stage. The project may choose to move outside the Academy Software Foundation at any time.
