# Technical Steering Committee (TSC) FAQ

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the leadership of the project. This committee's primary role is to:

- Set the overall direction of the project
- Ensure the project community has the needed resources and infrastructure to succeed
- Resolve any issues within the project community
- Provide project updates to the TAC and the community at large

Typically the TSC is comprised of the primary committers or maintainers in a project. To start there may be an appointed list, but over time more individuals may join the TSC according to the policies the TSC set for how new members are added. Regardless, TSC meetings are generally open to anyone interested unless there are sensitive issues to discuss which necessitate a private meeting.

## TSC Roles

Generally TSCs have a few roles to faciliate the operations of the TSC. Roles are elected by TSC voting members and term lengths are determined by the TSC.

### Chairperson

The TSC Chairperson is the figure head of the project. The TSC Chairperson's primary role is to:

- Lead all meetings of the TSC, setting the agenda with consultation of other TSC members.
- Be the public spokesperson for the project at events and in public communications ( such as PR/AR meetings, articles, blog posts )
- Serve as a representative of the project to the TAC and other projects and entities.

### Secretary

The Secretary records all meeting notes for TSC members and ensures they are distributed to the project community after the meeting in a timely manner. Often projects have a rotating secretary role instead of a permanent role.

## TSC Meetings

TSC meetings are opportunities for the project community to come together to share updates and discuss issues and future plans. All TSC meetings are considered open to the public unless there is a sensitive issue to discuss ( Linux Foundation staff should be present on such meetings ).

It's recommend to schedule meetings on a regular cadence ( for example, every other week at 2pm US Pacific Time ). Many project communities alternate TSC meeting times if project members are globally dispursed ( for example, one time that is US Eastern/Europe friendly and another that is US Pacific/Asia/Australia friendly ).

### Scheduling logistics

Each project has access to a Zoom conference account and the ability to leverage groups.io for meeting scheduling. It's recommended that the TSC Chairperson send a meeting invite with each TSC voting member as an attendee, adding the general project discussion/developer/user list ( for example, otio-discussion@lists.aswf.io ) which will automaticaly add the meeting to the calendar for those on the project email lists.

### Agenda

The TSC Chairperson should share an agenda at least 24 hours prior to the meeting if possible, with an ask to share additional agenda items. Projects can share via the public discussion lists or using a pull request on GitHub.

## FAQs about TSCs

Q: Does a person lose their membership in a TSC if they leave or change employers?

A: No - TSC membership is bound to an individual and not an organization. If the change of employment for a TSC member results in a key contributing organization having a lack of TSC representation, the TSC may chose to invite a new TSC member affiliated with that organization provided that that person meets any requirements set for TSC membership. 

Q: Does an individual serving on the TSC represent themselves, the project, and/or their employer?

A: As TSC members are individuals within the context of a TSC, it's expected that all their actions are for the general good of the project itself. It's not appropriate to use the project for anti-competitive purposes, nor is it appropriate to discuss a TSC member employer's product plans and roadmap in conjunction with the project planning.
