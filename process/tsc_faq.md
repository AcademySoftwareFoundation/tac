# Technical Steering Committee (TSC) FAQ

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the leadership of the project. This committee's primary role is to:

- Set the overall direction of the project
- Ensure the project community has the needed resources and infrastructure to succeed
- Resolve any issues within the project community
- Provide project updates to the TAC

Typically the TSC is comprised of the primary committers or maintainers in a project. To start there may be an appointed list, but over time more individuals may join the TSC according to the policies the TSC set for how new members are added. Regardless, TSC meetings are generally open to anyone interested unless there are sensitive issues to discuss which necessitate a private meeting.

## FAQs about TSCs

Q: Does a person lose their membership in a TSC if they leave or change employers?

A: No - TSC membership is bound to an individual and not an organization. If the change of employment for a TSC member results in a key contributing organization having a lack of TSC representation, the TSC may chose to invite a new TSC member affiliated with that organization provided that that person meets any requirements set for TSC membership. 

Q: Does an individual serving on the TSC represent themselves, the project, and/or their employer?

A: As TSC members are individuals within the context of a TSC, it's expected that all their actions are for the general good of the project itself. It's not appropriate to use the project for anti-competitive purposes, nor is it appropriate to discuss a TSC member employer's product plans and roadmap in conjunction with the project planning.
