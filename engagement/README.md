# Getting Involved in Projects

All of the projects hosted at the Academy Software Foundation are open and transparent, and welcome participation from anyone interested in the technology areas. Each project publishes their governance processes within their project repo ( typically in the README.md file or in a GOVERNANCE.md file within the primary project repo or TSC repo ) on roles within the community and how decision making is made.
