## Technical Projects and Working Groups 

Technical Projects are approved by TAC Members per the [project lifecycle guidelines](process/lifecycle). You can learn more about hosting projects at {{ site.foundation_name }} and how to propose a project for inclusion as an {{ site.foundation_name }} Technical Project [here](process/start_project).

Each of the {{ site.foundation_name }} projects are open to participation by anyone subject to the governance each project has adopted. If you are looking for a way to contribute to a project, many {{ site.foundation_name }} projects maintain a list of issues that are suited for first-time contributors on [CLOTributor].

Working groups may be formed by the TAC to focus on specific areas of technical interest or need within {{ site.foundation_name }}.  They report to the TAC which remains responsible for any formal decisions or voting matters.

Below are the projects and working groups supported by the TAC, listed by [project stage](process/lifecycle)
