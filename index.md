- Coordinating collaboration among Technical Projects, including development of an overall technical vision for the community;
- Making recommendations to the Budget Committee of resource priorities for Technical Projects;
- Electing annually a chairperson to preside over meetings, set the agenda for meetings, ensure meeting minutes are taken and who will also serve on the Governing Board as the TAC’s representative (the “TAC Representative”);
- Creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes, subject to the approval of the Governing Board; and
- Such other matters related to the technical role of the TAC as may be communicated to the TAC by the Governing Board.

# Technical Projects 

Technical Projects are approved by TAC Members per the [project lifecycle guidelines](process/lifecycle). You can learn more about hosting projects at {{ site.foundation_name }} and how to propose a project for inclusion as an {{ site.foundation_name }} Technical Project [here](process/start_project).

Each of the {{ site.foundation_name }} projects are open to participation by anyone subject to the governance each project has adopted. If you are looking for a way to contribute to a project, many {{ site.foundation_name }} projects maintain a list of issues that are suited for first-time contributors on [CLOTributor].

Working groups may be formed by the TAC to focus on specific areas of technical interest or need within {{ site.foundation_name }}.  They report to the TAC which remains responsible for any formal decisions or voting matters.

Below are the projects and working groups supported by the TAC, listed by [project stage](process/lifecycle)
