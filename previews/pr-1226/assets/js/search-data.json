    "content": "Mr. Dolan introduced himself to the group and gave an overview of the technical community and structure of the ASWF, along with the role of the TAC. Each of the initial TAC voting members introduced themselves. Mr. Dolan presented a plan for TAC Chairperson elections, there were no questions or concerns from the TAC members. Mr. Ha presented an overview of the technical infrastructure. The following questions came up: . | Mr. Vera raised a question in regards to the DCO signoff process, if there is anything else needed to be done outside of the DCO signoff on the commits. Mr. Dolan indicated there wasn’t, and further indicated that the DCO isn’t a CLA which requires a formal agreement and process. | There were questions around the support of CLAs with ASWF projects. Mr. Dolan indicated that the legal committee should review the needs, and also indicated that the LF does have a system for managing this if needed. | There was a question on bringing third party dependencies into the project build processes, whether they are projects inside the ASWF or out. Mr. Ha said that inside ASWF project can leverage nexus and for third party projects the code will be pulled into nexus as well. | . Mr. Dolan walked through the project lifecycle and proposal process for review. The following questions came up: . | There was a discussion of how to make the community aware of this process. Mr. Dolan indicated that typically the lifecycle and proposal template would be posted online, and that applying projects would email the TAC to do proposals. | There was a question of using a separate email list for proposals. Mr. Warnicke advised on not creating a separate list. Others suggested a JIRA issue to track the process. | . Mr. Dolan opened up the proposal for comments via Google Docs at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dff0iXigSGj-11-nbmriQhtU73ey8TUqjnHIMcgTw40/edit , indicating that many projects are ready to move through the process. All TAC members said that we should start using this process with the initial projects and use that to gather feedback on the process. Mr. Dolan indicated that Mr. Mertic would follow up over email to coordinate meeting cadence, with weekly meetings to start. ",

Henry Vera said he would like to add some comments to the document now that it’s in GitHub. Andrew and Bill presented the OpenVDB Proposal. The following feedback came from the TAC: . | There were questions raised around patent implications. Mike Dolan indicated that a legal committee should review this and come back with a suggested response. | There were questions around dependency management for a project, and if the TAC should have a role here. Mike Dolan indicated that each project should manage this indivudually because they can change from release to release. | There were questions on the resource costs to the project. Andrew indicated that he would share those and Thanh would review. | Andrew also indicated that the internal code checks and processes would be contributed. | There was also discussion of the desire to improve code quality with the move under the AWSF. | There was a question of whether in makes sense to change the license. Mike Dolan indicated the TAC could at the time of the project coming in, but this could delay the process. | . There was some additional discussion on having open source projects included have commerical license dependencies. Mike Dolan raised concerns on the CI/build Infrastructure being more complicated with commericial dependencies, and the TAC then discussed forming a group to investigate this more. John Mertic brought forward a motion to approve OpenVDB as an Incubation project. Kimball motioned, Henry seconded, and all voted in favor. ",

Andrew indicated that a CLA would still be used, but the plan is to translation to an LF standard CLA. Andrew indicated that there weren’t plans to change the license at this point, but the LCC TSC may choose to do this as part of the LCC being formed. Daniel asked about resource needs for the AWSF TAC to track in regards to this project, which Andrew indicated that he would assess. There was a question around other projects being accepted. John indicated that there is no blocker for other projects to be reviewed while OpenVDB is in the process of reviewing. Gordon and other TAC members indicated that it would great to see these projects proposed as quickly as possible. David Morin indicated that OpencolorIO would be a project likely to be added alongside Sony joining ASWF. OpenVDB said it won’t appoint a TAC representative until it holds it’s initial TSC meetings. There was additional discussion on having a standard/recommended licensing and contribution process for all projects. John indicated in general that it would be something for Daniel to recommend to the Governing Board on creating a standard licensing and contribution scheme, but many established projects would have difficulty in adopting. Daniel gave an update on the working group investigating build/CI for projects needing non-open source dependencies. Thanh indicated it would be best to start the process by bringing in OpenVDB as the first project to determine the specific needs and job evalution. There was further discussion on build assets and build matrix. ",

    "content": "Andrew gave an update on OpenVDB, indicating that they are still iterating on the charter and the plan is to present the resource needs to the Governing Board for approval. There was discussion on the resource needs which OpenVDB indicated they are working through the details on. Thanh indicated that Windows build should be almost ready, working with OpenEXR to prove out the model. There was a question around if Jenkins could size out the builders for a given project; Thanh showcased the options that the cloud provider has at https://vexxhost.com/public-cloud/servers, as well as talking about the Jenkins configuration for which type of build node a Jenkins job would use. Mike Dolan asked Thanh to elaborate on the full costs and scope around CI infrastructure for a given project; Thanh said the starting point would be 10 builders and if that needs to be increased the TAC would need to review the need and costs. Thanh said the cloud provider indicated it could have GPUs available for builders and asked the TAC for guidance on the project requirements for GPUs. OpenVDB indicated they didn’t have present requirements but downstream users of the code have built extensions that leverage a GPU. Daniel said that the group should evaluate the specific project needs, but generally said a recent NVidia GPU would generally work. There was further discussion on details, and Thanh said he would work with the cloud provider for a proof of concept. There was an update on the EULAs for the builds; the Autodesk EULA should be able to be used for the builds. Larry Gritz has started the proposal for OpenColorIO, and indicated that the initial focus is completing internal approval for membership first before submitting the proposal. There was no update for OpenEXR, but attendees indicated they believe the proposal is in progress. Daniel indicated that the VFXPlatform working group has invited a TAC representative to join, and asked to contact him offline if they wish to fill that role. John Mertic shared that new TAC projects should use the Apache 2 license with a DCO if it is a net-new project ( per the charter guidelines ) and the TAC should carefully considering asking new projects to change licenses due to the high burden on the project. All TAC members generally agreed with this approach. David Morin said the IBM had interest in bringing a blockchain project forward and one with CHAOSS that has interest of being under the ASWF, asking if there is guidance on projects suitablity of a given project. There was some discussion that projects don’t have to specifically be code, but it should advance the goals of the ASWF. ",

Thanh indicated the CI provider has K80 GPUs from NVidia for testing use, and asked the TAC if that was sufficient for testing. Daniel indicated he believed that should work, but would need the OpenVDB project to confirm. No new news from OpenEXR and OpenColorIO project proposals, both are waiting on thier respective companies internal processes. Daniel shared that David Morin has been asked by the Governing Board to fill the role of Executive Director of the ASWF. David shared a few words on the background and the role he is filling, specifically around strategy, project recruitment, and fundraising. Brian from Google shared that Google would offer free cloud infrastructure if the AWSF would choose to use it. There was no one coming forward to serve as the TAC rep to serve on VFX Reference Platform Working Group. There was discussion on projects to adopt into ASWF, encouring net new projects that AWSF could bootstrap in the community. There was discussion of ImageIO, including it’s participation in Google Summer of Code. John indicated that the ASWF might consider running it’s own project if it wishes to more directly manage the process, and agreed to share examples via email after the meeting. OpenTimelineIO was suggested by David Morin, which others agreed is a good candidate project. David Morin agreed to follow up with the current project owners to check thier interest. Daniel suggested moving the meeting to a fortnightly basis, which all agreed to. All agreed to look at time adjustments at future meetings. There was some discussion of other academic opportunities to investigate, which Daniel said should continue discussion on on the mailing list. ",

    "content": "Andrew Pearce presented the OpenVDB Technical Charter and CLA for formal approval. The reasons for requiring a CLA were explained primarily as making explicit an organisation’s consent for the contributions of its employees. The Linux Foundation minimal CLA was chosen. There was discussion of the benefits and costs of CLAs and the likely scenarios for CLAs for future ASWF projects. Larry noted that Sony currently uses an umbrella CLA for contributions to all of its OSS projects; organisations may choose to restrict this to particular projects if they desire. Mike Dolan outlined experiences from other projects which suggested a mixture of three models will emerge for ASWF projects: no DCO, Apache CLA for Apache licenced projects, and LF minimal CLA for other licences. Daniel suggested that the TAC might request the Governing Board refer general CLA guidance to the ASWF legal committee. The TAC voted unanimously to accept the OpenVDB Technical Charter and CLA. ",

Daniel also shared that the Governing Board has a goal of 6 projects accepted into the ASWF by October next year. There was continued on the licensing/CLA recommendations for incoming projects. John said he would put together a recommendation for incoming projects and licensing/CLA usage. Daniel welcomed JF Panisset to the TAC and asked for the TAC to approve him as an industry voting representative for the TAC. Daniel motioned, Andrew seconded, and it was unanimously approved. Daniel asked if the TAC should publish the template project Technical Charter in TAC github, and to request all new projects publically publish thier techincal charters as well. All in attendance agreed. Andrew shared that OpenVDB has been moved over to the ASWF, and the next step is achieving a CII Best Practices badge. John said he can work with DreamWorks on how to achieve that badge. Thanh reported good progress and testing with the GPU, and was looking to formalize this. OpenEXR update indicated the ILM legal and procedural process is still ongoing. OpenColorIO update from Larry indicated that legal meetings are going well and he is working with the community itself for building the charter. OTio update from Cory indicated they are still working out the governance processes, and hopes to have an update at the next meeting. Daniel shared that the offer using Google Cloud was deemed to complex to take advantage of, and will not be pursuing this. Daniel discussed a project to have the ASWF CI build out the VFX Reference Platform. Thanh discussed some options using packer or having a third party project repo for sharing them. Daniel suggested a follow up conversation in a working group to discuss this further. ",

Larry elaborated on the CMakeTools project that he introduced on the TAC mailing list. There was support and encouragement for the project. Kimball described another possible project to provide decoding and processing of camera raw images. Existing projects in the area such as dcraw and libraw were discussed as was the importance of maintaining and recognising the contributions of these projects. Daniel highlighted the opportunity to involve camera manufacturers directly in this project via the ASWF. Work from John and the Linux Foundation in providing clear background and guidance on ASWF LIcense and CLA questions was raised in the form of an open PR on the TAC github.

    "content": "The first OpenVDB TSC meeting has taken place, along with formal recognition of the project chair and committers. CII badge certification continues to be a challenge, requiring unfamiliar tools and questions about how to report “known issues”. Sonar Qube has previously been proposed as a component of the ASWF CI which can provide the necessary analysis tools, which will be followed up in the CI Working Group. Larry provided an update on the OpenColorIO proposal, which has progressed to drafts for the proposal documents under internal review prior to submission. Further templates and guidelines to assist project proposal and adoption have been prepared by John with the input of others. The group agreed that these are ready to merge on the TAC github. Daniel summarized some of the first year goals that had been proposed for the ASWF during the last board meeting. The most relevant for the TAC is the goal to have 6 projects accepted by September 2019. David expanded on this and offered to present a slide at the next meetings. The 6 projects would require new projects to be created or identified beyond the original 3 candidates (OpenVDB, OpenColorIO, OpenEXR). JF noted that the TAC should refer to the industry OSS survey by the VES’s Sam Richards during the ASWF formation process. ",

Ken indicated that AutoDesk reached out in the past week to see if there is interest in bringing in some of thier technology into OpenVDB; the TSC is reviewing and determining if there is a fit. There was some discussion on the copyright notices in the files themselves and the status of the CI and build system. Larry presented the OpenColorIO project for inclusion at the Incubation stage, walking through the application sent via the email list. Since there was no quorum, Daniel suggested to take the vote via email once Larry has the charter ready as well. OpenEXR had no updates, still working through legal review. No updates from CMakeTools either. David presented the year 1 goals for the ASWF. David shared that the group could meeting in February in person if they wish; Daniel said he would discuss via email with the group to gauge interest. Daniel asked TAC meetings to review the list of projects identified during the formation process as possible projects to include ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p3bmPhhoXZoKQHYhVI9xbuXFlUq8kcg67Ws1yE70L6o/edit#gid=0 ).

May be driven by OpenColorIO upcoming project. | . | . | LA ASWF Meeting: 7 Feb 2019 . | Agenda . | TAC update | Project updates: presenters for each project (OpenVDB, OpenEXR, OpenColorIO) | Presentations ideally in person, but teleconferencing will be available | TAC-related items are mostly 13:00-15:00 PST (lunch at 12:00). | Questions to Daniel Heckenberg or David Morin | Take stock of where we are and plan for goals until SIGGRAPH 2019 | Tentative face to face TAC meeting after end of official agenda, proposing 16:00 at same location, AMPAS headquarters, teleconferencing available. May cause shuffling of TAC / CI meeting cadence, will impact some members in other timezones. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Updates from Ken | High cadence of meetings before end of 2018 (4 or 5 meetings per week), very productive | Release of version 6.0, mostly compliant with VFX Reference Platform | Some API changes, hence new major version number. | Next release may be 6.0.1 or 6.1, TBD | Major contribution from DNeg, JIT language compilation (presented a DigiPro 2018) | Contacts with Autodesk, key developers at BiFrost: would OpenVDB be interested in adopting multi-resolution data structure they developed. Feedback to Autodesk, waiting for their answers to questions. | Seems very interesting, not completely clear if this would mean replacing the current data structure completely (unlikely) or extending it. | Close contacts with Intel, they would like to join the meetings, they might have specific contributions to make. Jim: lots of work in multi-resolution volume rendering done at Intel, they would like their OSPRay codebase to support OpenVDB, and look at contributions that could be made to OpenVDB. | NVIDIA is worlking on GVDB, potential for collaboration. | Discussing putting together a SIGGRAPH course for 2019. | Things are going well, no blocking issues, a large backlog of new things coming. | Daniel: is OpenVDB considering using the foundation CI instead of current TravisCI, and question about changing license reference style and copyright notices. Ken: topics are still under debate, they have a meeting tomorrow, so may have more to say at next meeting. | . | . | OpenColorIO application review . | Proposal | Charter, DCO, CLAs | Governance | Contribution | License (3 clause BSD) | Larry: links above point to final documents, minimal changes from the OpenVDB project. Keeping BSD 3-clause license, governing documents in the repo for the last few weeks. They are ready to go. | Vote for adoption (incubation stage) . | Kimball makes the proposal | Dreamworks seconds | No opposing votes, no abstains, so unanimous with quorum | Project is accepted to become official ASWF project | Will take offline discussion of details of how to make the official transition | OpenVDB can help with the process | . | . | CI updates . | Working group . | Progress on goal of integrating VFX Reference Platform dependencies into the build / CI system. Some full stack Reference Platform compliant builds accomplished. | Discussion on using conan.io as a way to manage cross package depencies and manage build environment. Attempts to be the C/C++ equivalent of package managers for other languages such as npm. | . | Static analysis for CII badge . | What approach is most suitable, especially to try to attain CII badge level. | Partly due to lack of more sophisticated tools, current “best practices” are not that difficult to follow. Running clang-tidy with a few disabled checks, lgtm (commercial tool) allows free scans of OSS projects look promising to achieve CII badge. | OpenVDB has looked at more sophisticated tooling and may be able to offer insight (Vericode?). | CII badge requirements are somewhat vague (by design), mainly you sign up to fix medium to high priority security issues that have been reported. Mostly about adhering to coding best practices. | John from LF mentioned the requirement to identify a security expert within the project, which can be challenging. Could it be solved across all projects? | Larry: no formal requirements listed for the “security expert”, is a competent senior software developer sufficient for this role? Is MPAA / TPN familiarity relevant? | Security is important when exchanging data between studios, which is most of what the initial OSS projects concentrate on. | Should we try to reach out to external experts? | Larry: are there resources within the LF? | . | Follow up: Action item from OpenVDB: Nexus IQ scans (LF) | Follow up: Check with Linux Foundation about security expertise | Follow up: Check with Linux Foundation on specifics of designated security expert for each project | Follow up: SideFX Houdini API for CI usage. EULA evaluation. (LF) | . | Update on candidate projects . | OpenEXR . | Corey: no specific updates at this point. | Carey Philips: winding its way through the process, should be nearing completion | Update from Francois Chardavoine: confident it would be ready to propose adoption at some time in February. Last outstanding issues related to trademark and assignment. | . | CMakeTools | Others? . | We need 3 additional projects to meet our goal of 6 active projects by SIGGRAPH | Kimball has been working on CMakeTools project: will pick up work after the holiday break. Goal is to have common Cmake infrastructure to be shared between project. Currently using OpenVDB, OpenColorIO and OpenEXR as a testbed. | Larry will have another project to propose by next TAC meeting, too early to say which but feels he has a good candidate. | Daniel: AL has been discussing with Autodesk how to share work on MayaUSD plugin (currently independent of USD projects), could be a ASWF project. Bringing in USD as a CI dependency brings in another dozen dependent projects. | Daniel: is “environment management” a suitable project? For instance the Rez project? Discussed with main author, won’t happen in short term but could be possible. Dependency management has been tackled by every studio, is there room for a “general” solution. | Larry: interested in collaborating on this problem to avoid every studio having to solve that problem on their own. | Carey Philips: looking for specific success stories for ASWF so far. Asking of Ken from OpenVDB: what would you suggest are specific achievements due to the foundation? Ken: before Foundation, OpenVDB was run by one person at Dreamworks, who was overwhelmed. Foundation of governance structure brought contributions from several studios that Dreamworks had not heard of before. Have been approached by commercial partners (Autodesk, Intel, nVidia) more than before. OpenVDB seems to have entered a “new phase”, developers are energized, a very positive experience. Good to hear that actual code has been written and released, not just organizational. WETA’s appetite to contribute to projects has increased because of it. | Larry: what happens if multiple projects from a company are ASWF projects, does each one has to have a separate TAC representative? Should something like the CMake project be a “full scale” project? Maybe we need to define different “levels” of projects. Should follow up with Linux Foundation. | . | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Ongoing discussion on dependency management options, both for CI builds but also wider problems in studios | lLst meeting joined by Allan Johns maintainer of Rez project, also discuss whether Rez belongs as a ASWF project | clang-tidy would be a sufficient tool for CII badge compliance, can integrate variety of external tools (including free for open source commercial tools) | Requirement for a security expert for CII badge, Intel (James Jeffers) offered some security expertise support | Should designated ecurity experts operate within individual projects, or operate at a higher (ASWF) level | Ken Museth (OpenVDB): Ken feels it would be good to share expertise between projects. Guidelines are very vague, so we need to agree on specific goals. James (Intel): can also help defining security goals and processes, not just actual development support. Intel has “Security Champions” who could contribute. Gordon Bradley (Autodesk) has similarly “Security Champions”: Autodesk feels the idea of every project have a security expert is unrealistic. Project-specific “Security Champions” can consult with company-wide security experts, deal with handling of specific security issues. Intel agrees with that model. Gordon: 90% of your issues are in external libraries, not your own code, how do you address issues in external libraries. | Daniel: OpenEXR has 12 reported CVEs, so that’s an example | Ken: EXR, VDB are exchange formats which support encoding metadata, so can be vectors for malware. | James: will need some kind of signing process for build artefacts. | Gordon: trying to bullet proof a file format has lots of implications (performance, development effort…), we need to be pragmatic with our investments. May need to define the scope of what we are trying to address. | Larry: may not be able to “hide behind” the idea that studios work behind firewalls: ASWF may cause our projects to gain wider adoption, outside of our restricted environments | Daniel: Apple offered to help with fuzzing | John Mertic (LF) DCO and signing of past commits: git log for past commits, add those to text file, sign off that log of your past commits with DCO. Do you need to chase down all former committers? If all committers are from one company, can nominate a person to sign off all commits from that company. For external contributors, would be good to try to chase them down, or use CLA if there’s automatic assignment. Are there tools to report on DCO coverage of a project? There’s a Ruby command line tool, documented in ASWF documents. Does this need to be done before a project joins the ASWF? For new commits there’s a “DCO Bot” that prevents unsigned commits. LF does a “license scan” of existing code before a project is onboarded (to make sure project is consistently licensed), could add DCO scanning. | Gordon (Autodesk): if one of the goals is to help onboarding projects, how to we make things easier for new projects, and not throw up barriers. How can the ASWF help? We have access to some funding, could pro-actively scan potential projects? | John (LF): they try to highlight potential problems, but different companies may do things differently. For instance handling of copyright statements. LF tries to make license compliance as easy as possible for developers, LF can take care of the “ugly problems”, but they cannot give legal advice. LF does have forums for member legal teams to discuss / collaborate. | Kimball: there is a one line git command to find commits not signed with DCO | Larry: we should have a “best practices guide” aimed at potentials projects / prior to applying / creating new projects from scratch (always easier to do at start). | John (LF): we need to document what we are learning, every open source project is slightly different | . Motion: accept the PR from John at LF for instructions / guidelines requirements for CDOs on past commits . | Daniel moves. | No opposes, no abstains | . ",

When a project gets onboarded should we reset the versioning scheme to pick a consistent scheme, best to do now if we are going to do it. | Kimbal: needs to be tied to VFX Reference Platform, which is tied to our CI infrastructure. | Gordon (Autodesk): how do you deal with coupling in revision updates between VFX Reference Platform and individual components. He really likes the idea of a consistent versioning scheme. Also hits the goal of providing a “platform” for new projects. | Ken (OpenVDB): doesn’t like the idea of resetting existing versioning numbers. | Daniel: what is the proliferation at this stage? How many models, for instance USD (YYYY.MM), Linux creates specific scheme (X.Y.Z). | Guido: what does X.Y.Z even mean? Could at least make sure to define what those numbers mean. | John (LF): could align with semantic versioning scheme. This is a part of dependency management, should be not contentious and there’s a chance to fix a “low hanging fruit”. | Daniel: start with semantic versioning. | Ken: OpenVDB is slightly deviating from semantic versioning, they only apply that to the data structure, so change in minor version guarantees backward compatibility for the data files but not the tools. Similar for ACES, sometimes unclear where changes fit within that versioning system. | John (LF): largest issue is API compatibility. | Ken: also care about ABI compatibility. | . | Project Test Data . | Guido (Pixar): how to deal with test data that goes with projects / test suites. There should be a mechanism to include test data in actual libraries for testing and validation, should that be a pre-requisite for acceptance? | Larry: this is a requirement for CII badge. | John (LF): this can be part of the incubation phase. Projects can skip incubation phase if it feels it meets all requirements. | . | Brian Cipriano (Google): OpenCue project proposal is coming soon. | Daniel: How do we get the work for Mac / Windows done. | Some initial work on Windows from LF Release Engineering team to provide a platform, but need sufficient motivation to start moving builds and tests on Windows, OpenColorIO is very motivated to do so. Should we look for expertise elsewhere? | Doug Walker (autodesk): need help from Linux Foundation to help get infrastructure set up, interface with LF RelEng. | Gordon: they have some Windows expertise, but they would like to keep it on the actual OpenColorIO project, would rather see infrastructure come from LF Infrastructure. | Larry: do any of the member companies have resources? | Matt (Epic): Windows is their primary platform, they will see if they have resources available. | Thanh (LF): happy to join any calls to help getting up Windows infrastructure running. Also Apple is soon to (hopefully) join the ASWF so would be able to help with Mac builds. | James (Intel): OSPRay uses CMake to support all platforms, they make it a point to support all platforms, could this be a model to follow? | Daniel: We also need feedback from Windows / Mac people in studios to ask if support is usable. | Liam Fernandez (Blur Studio): they are mostly Windows based, very interested in helping with Windows build infrastructure. They have also struggled with semantic versioning. | Guido: surprised that Windows CI infrastructure didn’t come from LF? | John (LF): the infrastructure they provide should be configurable by the individual foundations. | Thanh (LF): he’s here to help, the community is there to “lead the charge”. If there are resources LF is not providing, he can go back to see if that can be addressed. | Larry (Sony): foundational projects have a current set of maintainers are Linux centric, need to bring in outside people who can help. | Daniel: we need to take advantage of the offers of support to help with outstanding issues. | . | .

Paid tier is billed by minute, so don’t have to host full time VMs. | Gordon: goals of the foundation is to build the platform we need, should we move to latest &amp; greatest vs leveraging existing Jenkins expertise within organization members. Should we have a straw poll? . | Larry: has used Travis and AppVeyor, apparently Travis is in beta for Windows support. Other than the Linux vs Windows differences, conceptual differences between Travis / AppVeyor were minimal. | Thanh: there is a self hosted / enterprise option. Standard Jenkins CI from LF has been very well tested with Linux, but not with Windows / Mac, we have a proof of concept for Windows builds, hasn’t been used in anger yet. Also our Jenkins doesn’t have Mac support yet. | Gordon: we should build a prototype for OCIO which has clear cross platform needs. | Daniel: through ASWF members we have had offers of free or subsidized cloud platform, the more we move away from Jenkins / OpenStack model to a “SaaS” model, the less likely we can leverage those offers (from instance Google GCP). If we are looking to move away from OpenStack / Jenkins, we need to determine what we are trying to optimize for. Agrees we should do lightweight prototyping for OCIO. Also the more we formalize our dependency management, the less complexity we need from the CI system. We should have as little configuration within the CI system as possible, should be handled in our projects. | Daniel: do we foresee issues using something like CircleCI with commercial components (managing secrets, licenses). Robert (SideFX): doesn’t see different issues from LF Jenkins infrastructure. Gordon: does CircleCI work happen on “their” servers, that could affect licensing issues? Current infrastructure runs on a cloud provider (VEXXhost). Gordon: there may be a difference between running a public cloud infrastructure provider that you are paying for, as opposed to some other corporate entity (who may be using a cloud provider themselves). Could trigger some subtle license issues. Gordon: if we are going to make a decision to move away, we need to know better what is motivating the change. Jeff: one factor is bringing in the ability to bring in the infrastructure to inside the company, a for pay solution might be more complicated. | Daniel: taking the “mood of the room”: we aren’t sold on the tradeoff of going to a SaaS model via our own infrastructure, and what we would be gaining vs giving up. Is it worth the investment of time from the LF releng team. Gordon: agrees. From the in person meeting, one of the reasons we picked the LF, we wanted to leverage the infrastructure, and we assumed there would be cross platform support. Travis doesn’t offer GPU instances, CircleCI does. | Daniel: asking Thanh to provide a short summary to present at TAC meeting next week. We should understand the impact on the environment configuration side of things. | Aloys: AL is already using Jenkins, you can run it everywhere (public cloud, on premise), seems a more open system. There’s a difference between “raw” Jenkins and Jenkins deployed by LF, they build VMs and run it on OpenStack cloud provider. At AL they have Jenkins jobs running on Windows / Mac. | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 1 . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Decided on deprecation strategy: will support current and last 2 years of VFX Reference Platform, helps to transition away from older releases. | Release schedule: new major version Q3 or Q4, 2018 was quite late in the year, but typically around Oct-Nov, bump major version once a year. 7.0.0 in 2019, currently discussing what goes into that release (major releases can change ABI). | Draft GitHub pull request with CircleCI prototype to share with others to show what was needed, not complete, but builds correctly, supports different years of VFX Reference Platform. Waiting on decision of whether we move forward with CircleCI. | Have been using move to ASWF as opportunity to unify some processes, in particular the way they build Houdini SOPs. OpenVDB is shipped with Houdini, so had to deal with vendor-supplied and open source versions, trying to come up with a better way to deal with both sets of SOPs. | Work is continuing with transition to CMake, main focus of CI-related effort. | . | OpenColorIO . | Moving mailing lists to ASWF domain, shutting down old google group next Monday. | OCIO 1.1.1 bugfix release, optional compatibility with OIIO 2, next week or two. First release in a year, well due | Working on resolving embedded external dependencies, blocker on moving the repo over to ASWF. | Working on pairing developers to task, lots of interest in using OCIO v2, but that could be a year away. | Opportunity for member companies to dedicate some engineering time. | Will create GitHub Issues for tasks that need help. | One task is Metal render integration for macOS platform with upcoming OpenGL deprecation. | Recently made strides with ACES compatibility. Implements low level ACES algorithms as code instead of using LUTs. | Also ACES common LUT format is supported in Master branch, needed for official ACES support. Could do intermediate release with ACES compatibility if extra resources available? Maybe not, tied to changes to core renderer. | Daniel: lots of excitement when V2 features announced, also how does this line up with next VFX Reference Platform. Robert: meetings for 2020 starting soon, can bring up issues. | More generally need to coordinate ASWF releases. | Larry: would help to get schedule guidance from VFX Reference Platform to drive development of ASWF projects. | Robert: SIGGRAPH is “unofficial” deadline, but unclear what step this deadline is for. Process is somewhat fluid. Typically draft by SIGGRAPH time, but can entertain later releases with an amendment later in the year. | Larry: ASWF projects should try to line up for similar deadlines to make things easier / simpler, especially given cross project dependencies. | Daniel: opportunity to create a timeframe and process, and build a working prototype of next VFX Reference Platform. | . | . | OpenCue proposal . | https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/topic/project_contribution/29992570 | Vote on adoption (incubation stage) . | Larry: do we need further discussion before the vote happens? Don’t want a “provisional vote” that people would object to. | Bill: would like to see some discussion on it, time to do a deeper investigation on it. Same from Kimball. | Set goal of next TAC meeting for actual vote. Brian: happy to provide additional material, send out development roadmap. | Larry: would be great if Google could share feedback from other sources. | What are the implications on testing? Google has a Jenkins environment for builds from GitHub, but currently not a full, live testing environment. | . | OpenCue currently uses the Apache CCLA and ICLA. Will this move to the LF / ASWF minimal CLA? . | Todd/Brian: still Apache CLA, based on Google legal team recommendation. Could loop in the legal folks. | Larry: OpenColorIO had previously used Apache 2 CLA, switched to variant to minimal LF CLA, reason was that it didn’t make much sense to use Apache 2 CLA with BSD license. But Apache 2 CLA with Apache 2 License probably makes sense. | Daniel: project adoption guidelines advises that there’s no necessity to use Apache 2 CLA, and preference is for minimal CLA. Larry: may be best to stick to license infrastructure agreed to by Sony and Google to streamline the process. | . | What skillset(s) are required to develop, deploy and test the components of OpenCue and the system as a whole? . | Brian (Google): interested in hearing about what specific components of OpenCue may be of concern. | Daniel: Oracle/Postgres stored procedures may not be very familiar. Brian: have been thinking about roadmap to migrate functionality outside of database into code. | Daniel: there seems to be a lack of discussion? | Bill: most ASWF projects so far already have wide industry adoption, is it an issue that OpenCue hasn’t seen wide adoption yet since it is so new. | Brian: this could be the what the incubation phase is for? | Todd: Google took on this project as collaborative project with Sony, but also based on feedback from users of GCP for rendering. Studios want a hybrid cloud / onprem rendering infrastructure and rendering framework. Being part of ASWF should help to drive adoption. Daniel: it’s the chicken/egg problem of driving adoption. | . | What CI coverage is currently in place for automated build and testing, and what are the requirements / costs of this setup? | Is there security expertise currently associated with the project? | ​(For the community) What’s the outlook for broad adoption of OpenCue? . | Mid size facilities very interested, minimize per node costs, one less licensing mechanism to worry about. | Dreamworks doing an eval | AL: OpenCue shows its age (tooling and mechanisms), not necessarily a problem, suitable for scale and applications. Some expertise in databases and database stored procedures may not be so widespread in VFX community. If ASWF adopts, will there be resources to continue to develop and maintain the system. | . | Brian: questions about the legal committee, what is required by the charter. | . | CI updates . | Working group | Discussion on using CircleCI instead of Jenkins with LF releng team, better support for all our target platforms | Challenge from Daniel: use OpenEXR fork as a prototype to implement CircleCI | SonarCloud instead of SonarQube | SideFX download client | . | Security Working Group . | Low response rate, is it a scheduling problem / timezone? Or a problem with resources / expertise / interest? (Doodle pool) | Kimball offers to help | Larry: should figure out who is willing to attend to learn, whereas who is willing to help / have expertise. | Daniel: followed up with people who offered explicit help at face to face meeting in LA, need to follow up again. | . | Common linear algebra library? . | Very good discussion on TAC mailing list | . | Matching resources and developers . | Larry: Came from OpenColorIO, debate in community about releases, dilemma about only 2 developers doing V2 release work, don’t want to be distracted to do a 1.2 release for instance. They also feel that collection of new features go together, don’t want to piecemeal the release of those features. But that can result in a very long release schedule. Additional development resources could help in earlier staging of some of these features. Currently there are more member companies than ASWF projects, and OCIO could use help from developers who are not domain experts. More generally how do we match the resources from member companies with project needs. | Kimball: should we use the “Summer of Code” model for matching needs to resources? Larry: there could be a Wiki where each project could post their top 5 requirements that could use additional / external resources. | Daniel: could be used as an on-ramp for developer level contributions to ASWF projects. | Dan: OpenVDB uses Jira, seems to work well for them. Was surprised at strong feelings against Jira. Doesn’t feel there’s a need to consolidate on single issue tracking system, but Jira works well for them. Could be a link to Jira issues from a Wiki page. GitHub has tags for “good first issues” to help new people approaching a project to pick tasks. | Larry: some projects require a lot of specialized knowledge to make anything but trivial contributions. Dan: hard to identify “simple issues” and not just do it yourself. Larry: projects can also use help with CI-related work, doesn’t require domain knowledge. Mike: setting up static analysis and identifying flagged issues doesn’t require domain knowledge. | . | Update on candidate projects . | OpenEXR | Others?

Consensus seems there is no problem taking on projects in order to drive adoption rather than needing that as a prerequisite. | Question of how to corral resources (commitments from members), especially in context of OpenColorIO. For now FTE commitment was left very general (“any open source activity”), but soon should think about specifically assigning those resources to ASWF projects. Larry: maybe too early to put on pressure to force commitment to ASWF projects only, but more direct members who currently have unallocated resources. | . | . | Thanh announcement . | Leaving Linux Foundation for a startup | Andrew Grimberg taking over his role for now, is caught up on all issues | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Work focussed on CMake updates, testing with CircleCI | . | OpenColorIO | . | CI updates . | Working group discussions | Some entrants for challenge that was set, no fully complete solutions, but Aloys got close with OpenEXR builds including Conan, CI system itself is a thin layer on top of recipes for package management, sourcing dependencies, and build (CMake) recipes. | Enthusiastic takeup on CircleCI, that style of CI system seems quite appealing. | We discussed other approaches, including Azure Pipelines, currently supports all 3 platforms. How does pricing compare to CircleCI? No understanding of GPU support on Azure. Looking to follow up for next week’s meeting. | . | OpenCue proposal . | Vote on adoption to incubation stage | We have quorum (exactly 50%) | DreamWorks and WETA were going to take a closer look at project. Dreamworks: scheduling is done on a per core basis, much more rigid than the way they currently schedule. They use percentages across shows rather than allocating cores to projects, which gives them high farm utilization, possibly higher than OpenCue approach. OpenCue takes a “every core is created equally”, they look at other aspects of the system. OpenCue couples the database to the scheduler, so if the DB goes down, scheduling would stop. Their approach relies less critically on the database. The OpenCue scheduler doesn’t expose a REST API, uses the Google Remote protocol instead, Dreamworks would prefer a REST API. In current state Dreamworks would probably not adopt OpenCue. Daniel: does Dreamworks see advantage to a common open source platform, could some of these features / approaches be put into a project like this? Bill: they probably wouldn’t contribute to this project as highest priority. | Brian: a lot of these feedback points are on the roadmap for future development, and they want to see more of this feedback from the community. | Kimball: some commonality in design with their in house system. Whether they would adopt it in the short term is orthogonal to the worth of the project being adopted in the ASWF. Good thing to have a project under active development, and they think it would be valuable to have it. | Eric: are there people / companies currently not contributing to this project who would contribute if it became an official project? What’s the practical difference being adopted vs not adopted? Kimbal: definitely some marketing exposure. Larry: reception on the long run would be better than a single studio / vendor project. Kimball: opportunity to see a new and vibrant project to grow within the community, model for new projects with larger / deeper scope. Brian: even if some of the TAC members aren’t contributing directly to code, having guidance from large studios would help to drive development. Todd: there’s an incubation period, so if we don’t see adoption, there’s a “way out” / other projects could take its place. Daniel: will add link to project lifecycle document. | Larry: if the model is that an incubating project may not graduate out of incubation, what happens to all of the material that got signed over to the foundation going into incubation (mailing lists on ASWF, project home on GitHub, signing over trademarks…). Is there a process for “spinning out” a project from incubation? | John: if a project is deemed that it should live elsewhere, ASWF can spin out assets to another entity, but not spelled out directly in lifecycle template, could use some clarification. If no one wants to pick up the project it could go into archive stage. Intent is that if a project enters incubation phase, it is expected that it will become a full fledged project. | David: first “new” project under consideration, we can rely on the templates provided by the Linux Foundation, but we can define our own process to address these questions, and the TAC is the correct body to make these decisions. It is important to add these questions at this point. The LF provided great templates based on previous work / experience, but we are free to adapt and change. | Daniel was given voting positions by some of the people who could not attend, but can’t present those if we are taking an in-person vote. So we should take this to an email vote. Daniel and John will set up a vote to take place ASAP after the meeting. | . | Vector / Matrix library . | Intense discussion for a while, but has tapered off. | Larry: summary is that we are trying to grope our way towards a minimal implementation that all projects could use for their public API, and perhaps for internal implementation, while leaving room for bit-accurate internal implementations. Luka was looking at whether they could share their internal designs (now that OpenEXR has applied). With EXR we have two separate projects with their separate implementations. But not much movement apart from mailing list discussion. Kimball: should it be part of IlmBase or a separate project. Larry: topic of split between IlmBase and OpenEXR proper has come up, application to ASWF gives forum to discuss this. No rush on this, and ASWF is good organization to tackle this. | Eric: has someone looked at GLM vector library? Larry: bigger than what he was thinking about. Larry: Eigen sometimes cited as something that projects explicitly don’t like to swallow as a dependency? We want to take advantage of new fp16 instructions on recent CPUs. | . | Update on candidate projects . | OpenEXR . | Proposal received 25-Mar-2019 | Can concentrate on voting next meeting once OpenCue is done | Should discuss on TAC mailing list | This will bring the 3 headline projects discussed during ASWF formation | We should start looking wider for other projects | . | Others? . | Kimball: CMake tools should probably not be a full project, still part of foundation. But raw2aces and photo developing project could still be a good candidate. | . | . | Next meeting | . ",

Should we discuss the concept of the “incubation stage”: that’s where a project goes to ‘get its stuff together’, for other projects it’s been the administrative steps of code repo transfers, licensing, contribution agreements. For OpenCue there’s the added dimension of it being a “new” technology (at least as an open source project). Should there be additions to the project lifecycle document that address these issues. Larry: does the current document speak of a “time limit” for the incubation phase, or should it be driven by the project itself? Or it is the responsibility of the TAC to make determination of end of incubation phase. The documentation speaks of an Annual Review for this case. Should this be updated / clarified? Similarly there is some documentation that speaks of the Graduation Review which doesn’t have specific language about adoption. | Timeframes for phases? | Henry: . | specific project criteria for graduation | Resource commitments and roadmap to address above? | . | Larry: exit path from incubation | John: asking Bill about his concern with | Kimball: we should have a discussion about resource prioritization between projects. | Daniel: will suggest some additions to the lifecycle document on TAC mailing list, as well as re-emphasize the existence of that document. | . | OpenEXR Adoption . | Proposal | Presented by Jonathan Stone, Lucasfilm advanced development group, lead on Material X, has been taking lead on several Open Source projects at Lucas Film | Created in 1999 at ILM, open sourced in 2003, received an Academy Sci-Tech Award in 2007. | Believes the incubation stage requirements are already met. | Adopted stage requirements: . | 39 committers on GitHub, individuals and companies | No CII badge yet | 1279 commits over GitHub lifetime | No documentation of list of committers | No technical lead appointed | No license scan submitted to TAC | . | Near term goals: . | CMake-based build / test infrastructure on near-term roadmap | 23 open pull requests to be merged | Need a way to report security issues | Should IlmBase be a separate Git module? | Discussion on lightweight, shared library for vector/matrix functionality | . | SIGGRAPH 2018 BOF feedback . | Simple and fast write path (along the lines of TinyEXR) | Integer image support (reducing the need for TIFF) | Standalone LibHalf library (and reconciliation with CUDA half type) | GPU decompression for performance (possibly supporting only a subset of formats) | Metadata standardization | . | Proposed list of initial Technical Steering Committee, also looking to give write access for recognized committers | Jim: does the current decompression use SIMD / parallelism / AVX512? Kimbal: fully multi-threaded, some snippets of SIMD code, but goal is to be portable, then be fast. So majority of the code is “generic CPU but multi-threaded”. Jim: may be an opportunity to pursue “GPU + SIMD” decompression. Larry: currently multi-threading is only in case where application is reading multiple scanlines at once. Part of the point of GPU decompression is when the end destination of the image is the GPU anyway. Usage patterns make it not attractive to use GPU decompression if you have to read the image back right away. | Daniel: project should move from current CLA to Linux Foundation minimal CLA. License for project is a modified 3-clause BSD. John: there are also some CLAs in the TAC repo. Jonathan: looking at adopting stock Linux Foundation CLA. | Vote on adoption to incubation stage. Daniel calling for the vote: Bill seconding. Project is approved unanimously. | Cary Philips: TAC should be involved in discussing the future of LibHalf / iMath since several facilities have a lot of code based on those libraries, so changes should not be undertaken lightly. Daniel: ASWF is the right place to discuss these impacts. Cary: iMath could be a separate project outside EXR, that’s not really a problem, but changing the API would. Daniel: every project ends up folding in its own math library… Justifiable but creates issues at scale. | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Dan Bailey: still looking at CI and CMake as main 2 projects on the roadmap, lots of progress being made. Should be able to migrate to CircleCI in next 2 weeks. | Received proposal from Autodesk for multi-resolution grid storage, will be discussing in next meeting, whether good fit with OpenVDB. | . | OpenColorIO . | Mike Dolan: put out a 1.1.1 release last week, first release in over a year, mostly bugfix / patch release. | Working on CII badge requirements, main focus of recent discussion. Some aspects were deferred on wider TAC-wide decisions, in particular security considerations and minimal static analysis requirements. Don’t want to go too far down the road if the wider community will decide to go in different direction. Daniel: lines up with OpenVDB situation, OpenCue will bring very different requirements. | Working on license scan issues, having discussions with ACES project over the ACES config that is widely used in OCIO repository and has license differences. | Approached by Marvel, interested in contributing to OCIO in near future. | . | . | CI updates . | Circle CI . | Andrew: no progress on discussions with CircleCI folks, meeting still hasn’t happened. Still trying to resolve that issue. From perspective of CI systems, RelEng evaluating Circle CI and Azure Pipelines from wider perspective of several projects under LF. | Internal discussion on Gitlab CI as a potential option (you can use GitLab CI against GitLab or GitHub). GitLab CI runner service supports all 3 major platforms. | . | Working group: see notes from last meeting | Jim: pointing out the Professional CMake book, which is a good, prescriptive book on how to use CMake. | . | John: CommunityBridge introduction . | May have been brought up on previous TAC call / email thread | Platform debued by Linux Foundation to help sustainability of Open Source projects, for instance mentorship programs. | Would TAC be interested in a presentation by someone from the CommunityBridge project? Daniel: yes, we would be interested. | John will make connection between team and Daniel, will be presenting at a future TAC meeting. | . | Update on industry / candidate projects . | DWA: USD Manager and others. Lightweight USD browser. About to contribute Nuke plugin that read / writes USD. Larry: what were considerations of making this a separate project instead of contributing back to USD project itself? Based on feedback from USD group. Gordon: probably same with USD Maya plugin. Larry: thinking about USD as a single, integrated “package” vs multiple independent projects. Message from USD team at SIGGRAPH 2018 was that plugins would move to external repositories. Jim: released USD Hydra / OSPray render as a separate plugin. | Data projects (e.g. wikihuman, datasets like Moana Island) . | Mostly static datasets | Different license requirements | Is there value for the ASWF in hosting those? | JF: could be used for testing infrastructure of existing projects | Gordon: job of hosting data could be quite different than hosting software / code. Should we focus on software / code for now? Those discussions came up earlier. Daniel: trying to get a sense as to whether there’s been a shift of opinion. Jim: they do load the Moana dataset every day, so it’s been hugely useful for them, but also understand that it is a different undertaking to host these datasets. | . | Vector / Matrix library | Camera raw library | others? | . | Next meeting . | April 24, 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 1 . | Progress on CI goals | Can we find useful projects to bring in to meet our 6 project goal. We need to accelerate the process on this. Does this cause dilution of effort? | JF: should different problems be tasked with trying to solve different aspects of what needs to be done to become a full fledged ASWF project. | Larry: rate of acceptance can be problematic when all projects are in the same phase. The “steady state” of accepting new projects will be less taxing. | Daniel: adding new projects adds resources and are a net gain rather than a dilution of resources. | Gordon: how could we demonstrate the benefit of the foundation by demonstrating what we’ve done with the existing projects rather than concentrating on getting additional projects (was goal of 6 projects somewhat arbitrary?). When ASWF was set up, wanted to solve the cross platform issues for one thing, are we happy with where we’ve gotten so far? | Eric: should ask individual project leads “what has the ASWF made easier”? “What are the next 2 things you expect from ASWF?” | Gordon: could do this as a SurveyMonkey of the ASWF project leads, and also for the ASWF members. That should give us a good idea of where to focus our energies. | Larry: SPI has other projects it can submit, haven’t been in a hurry to do this, given that the projects already in the queue are consuming a lot of bandwidth (CII badge, CI system, security…). Amount of work required to push the next project in will be a lot lower once the existing projects have solved those issues. Feels that this may be a thought in the heads of other people managing projects that could be potential candidates. | Daniel: consensus seems to be we should “clear the pipe” first, agrees with Gordon’s suggestion to consult with projects / members. | Larry: once OCIO gets all these requirements worked out, we will have a good story to tell, will be able to show all the benefits that OCIO got out of being part of the organization. | Cary: ultimate is to the users of the project, so a year from now hopefully people out in the community should be able to say “OpenEXR is so much easier to use” (for instance). Benefits to the maintainers is secondary benefit / means to an end. | Daniel: does this stretch to “easily instalable builds on every platform” for instance? Cary: yes, but also release cadence, number of outstanding pull requests, “this library is of greater value to the community than if the foundation had come along”. | Eric: coordination is also a good thing, picking standard components (linear algebra libraries for instance). Does adoption increase because of ASWF membership, giving confidence in longevity. | . | Governing Board meeting update . | Meeting yesterday | Discussion was mostly recap of process of accepting OpenCue and OpenEXR as incubation projects | Reviewed discussions of incubation stage vs graduation, what that means for the other projects in Foundation at this stage (see PR update) | Interesting news for upcoming events (SIGGRAPH) | . | Lifecycle doc updates . | PR | Need to support well established projects as well as new/upcoming projects | “Be deemed by the TAC to add potential or value to the mission of ASWF. “ : any suggestions for alternative wording to “add potential”? | We want to send a clear message in answer to questions about any projects outside of the “obvious candidates” | Doug: comment on “Graduation Review”. Should CII Badge requirement be part of that discussion? | Daniel: trying to restart efforts for security analysis | PR should be a prompt for discussion, not final result. | Need language about potential exit of project, “no fault / no damage” exit process. Not easy to specify in detail (discussion prompted by Larry). | . | LF CommunityBridge Intro . | Video | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Daniel: more work to establish CircleCI as alternative CI system to previous Travis / AppVeyor, doesn’t necessarily preclude future shift to Azure or other system. | Work to bring up other best practices such as updates to project copyright header, spdx headers | Large potential contribution from Autodesk for large, multi-resolution grid system, interesting but challenging contribution | . | OpenColorIO . | Starting to investigate SonarCloud integration (temporarily using SPI account) | Working towards CII badge: setting up vulnerability report project security@opencolorio.org which forwards to private OCIO TSC mailing list | Will have additional point releases prior to next VFX reference platform, which currently says 1.1.x | CLA system is up and running. Larry starting to investigate, moving towards repo transfer to ASWF | Sean Cooper will be representing OCIO on ACES TAC to connect both projects (since they are tightly coupled) | Daniel: have details of license scan been cleared up? Mike: not yet. Some external dependencies need to be cleared up, may need to revisit timeline / allocate more resources. Larry: mostly a function of developer bandwidth? Mike: yes. | Daniel: great to see practical steps being made on security requirements. | JF: does it make sense to extend security reporting infrastructure to every project, make it “the way to report security issues for ASWF project”? | Mike: investigated several projects that have CI badge (for instance Blender), many don’t support private reporting. Agrees it would make sense to have a standard approach. | Daniel: would make sense to create a pattern, test it, and if we like it extend it across multiple projects. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: not too much done yet, final approval went through not long ago | Next steps are to officially start the TSC and schedule meetings. Is there an “official process” for that? Daniel: this is covered in technical charter, John can provide help / guidance. | Jenkins migration is furthest along, looks promising so far, should be straightforward. | Should have more to discuss at next meeting. | . | OpenEXR . | Carey Philipps to be representative for now | Sent online poll to steering committee | . | . | CI updates . | CI platform comparison . | Andy: discussion around OpenCue using current LF Jenkins platform, sent info to Brian, info was useful. | SonarCloud: had discussion with Michael Dolan about OpenColorIO, we haven’t transferred ownership of the repo yet (still under SPI), so we can connect it to ASWF SonarCloud org. Will be working out documentation. | ASWF Azure Pipelines org created, need to pay for GPU. Can you invite individual contributors to the organization? For now need to use Microsoft accounts. | Will probably need some kind of sandbox setup to allow projects to experiment with the CI system | Was an issue in Jenkins system before a sandbox was added (sandbox gets “purged” every week) | Daniel: hoping for a mostly DevOps like setup, rather than a lot of configuration that lives inside the CI system. Should be able to use a PR-style approach to managing CI configuration. | Andrew: Linux Foundation is likely to be in charge that a repo is properly connected to a CI system. | . | CII badge . | Static analysis | Security . | John Mertic reaching out to CII badge program leaders to get more info | Daniel: reaching out to people who offered to help with security issues | . | . | . | Candidate projects . | SIGGRAPH . | Emily Olin: director of communications at LF | https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N_dB78EFZRdEi2qKWJEykaPP-swTqZFFwtzLcV5wxIw/edit?usp=sharing | Face to Face TAC meeting | Project BoFs and TSC meetings | First day is Digipro, submissions due May 3, some kind of sponsorship level contemplated | Sunday Pipeline conference, 100/200 people in Downtown LA, looking for speakers. | Also sponsoring SIGGRAPH Diversity and Inclusion summit | 3:30 to 4:30 Monday ASWF Overview BoF | 6:00 to 8:00 Beers of a Feather at Prank Bar | Tuesday: Trying to organize a Open Source Track for BoFs | Including projects outside of ASWF | Wednesday: Board Meeting, perhaps in person TAC meeting | Looking at inviting leaders of outside projects | Slots for individual ASWF projects | Kimball: are these replacing the traditional BoFs? Yes, working with SIGGRAPH organizers to bring together the open source BoFs. Trying to make it easier, avoid having to run back and forth between locations. | May become an “official” Open Source track in 2020. | Doug: Tuesday sessions would be outward facing updates to the outside work, Wednesday sessions would be for internal project issues? Emily: yes, Wednesday sessions are for smaller group, projects can decide what they want to do with those sessions. | Doug: last year OpenColorIO working session was 2hrs, so 1hr may not be sufficient, may need to schedule another hour somewhere else? Emily: lunch hour may be available. | Emily: please share any other talks related to ASWF so they can be coordinated and/or promoted | Emily: also looking for presenters at other technical conferences. | Daniel: next step to provide feedback to Emily about schedule, and confirmations from each project. | Daniel: Emily can help to publicize project releases | . | Next meeting: 8 May 2019 | .

There are suggestions to use tools that specifically check for security issues (not required). | Dynamic tool requirement is a suggestion, it is encouraged but is not a requirement. | https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/criteria.md | Security: no requirement that there is a “security expert” on each project, but list specific knowledge that someone must have . | Know-secure design | Knowing common errors . | E.g. CWE top 25 | . | . | Most tools provide some kind of guidance document about what should be turned on and off, apply common sense to avoid “busy work” | Use comment strings in code to disable specific scanner warnings | No specific requirements on the testing | Main idea is to have “something you can improve on”, start with weak rules, improve over time. | No specific requirements for testing, except: . | You must have automated testing in place | You must add new tests to cover new functionality | . | Different between green field and brown field, existing projects will typically have huge amounts of warnings | OpenColorIO . | Analysis and security are areas where they have yet to make much headway | How to deal with legacy code that has less test coverage vs new code that has good coverage: is it mandatory to go back to improve coverage of old code? David: there are 3 badge levels, “Passing / Silver / Gold”, focussing more on getting projects to “Passing” first. No strict coverage requirements for “Passing” level, there’s a “suggested” requirement for dynamic analysis. Vary the inputs / 80% coverage. For “Silver” you require 80% test coverage, of course possible to have high coverage yet a lousy test suite. Mike: OCIO has a “legacy” branch in current use, and mostly new code for the new version, so probably won’t go back and invest a lot of time in adding coverage to that old branch. David: focus at the project level, but expected that the idea is mostly “going forward”. So 80% coverage would be for the active development branch. Mike: future branch for release in 1 year or so. David: most of their projects release at a faster pace, so could target “passing” for now, “silver” for next major release. | . | . | CI updates . | (Andrew) Updates from LF . | Azure pipelines still most promising candidate (3 platform, GPU support and cost) | . | Working group | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Andrew: stale branch cleanup. | . | OpenColorIO . | Azure test project . | Michael: Setup for Linux builds. “Task” structure seems to work well.

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 1 (0:00-0:05) . | Timeline: . | May: CI platform decision (based on at least one example setup) | June: CII badge. At least one project graduation. | July: Dependency management. | . | . | LF CommunityBridge Intro (Bryan Stone, Shubhra Kar) (0:05-0:20) . | Video | Focus on funding diversity, security . | Putting money in the hands of maintainers, user groups, meetups, causes that use open source technology | Be an intermediary to allow transparent access to funds | Sample Project: Chaos Group, how would they like to spend the funds, mentorship opportunities, smaller portion towards marketing | There are some fees associated with running the platform, but fees get credited back under $10m | Do vulnerability scanning | Mentorships, companies can sponsor mentors, paid internships | Key contributors can guide new contributors | Showcase individual contributors | Companies can provide direct funds as well as positions | Basically matchmaking | Static code analysis, integrating existing service offerings | Daniel: ASWF is looking for mechanism to find contributors / matchmaking. Taken early steps through GitHub “First Issues” mechanism. | Interest from our members in mentoring | Looking for ways to share and grow our security expertise (we are somewhat of an outlier from other projects due to primarily C++ nature of our projects) | Mike, Larry: specific resources for OpenColorIO. 2 types of resources we are looking for: people just getting into Open Source, also ASWF members who are looking to do more significant contributions. | Bryan: no barrier to entry, no downside to adding project to CommunityBridge. Just go to communitybridge.org to submit the project. Basic information: repo location, logo, project description. Also what is the project looking for, also valid for non-technical contributions (project management, documentation…). Covers both paid internships and voluntary contributions. | Larry: needs will vary a lot between ASWF projects (and potential ASWF projects). Some projects have wide appeal, some are very niche with very narrow technical focus. No clear if “soliciting help from the world” is going to really help or just “generate noise”. So may be best to concentrate on people working at companies already part of ASWF / in the industry. | Bryan: can be used as just a landing page that you can point people to, can post link to that page on relevant forums. Larry: are there tools to filter projects on CommunityBridge based on interest / relevance? Bryan: currently no good tools for filtering / grouping but on the roadmap. | Daniel: as we develop auxiliary projects (CI-related, CMake), we need a better documentation infrastructure. | Bryan: some organizations have created a single “project” for the entire organization, others break it up into individual projects and seek specific skill sets for these individual projects. | Daniel will create ASWF page on CommunityBridge | . | . | CI updates (0:20-0:30) . | Last meeting in May, need decisions made before Board meeting next week | Platform decision (May) | Azure Pipelines testing . | Andrew: GPU access, increase parallel processing in Azure. No group discount rates currently, at moment more processing time would require paying market rate for those resources. Haven’t found exactly what those costs would be. | No agent pools available with GPUs, we would spin up a “container group”, install Azure Agent. | Azure: GPU on Linux only | Since we can run our own agent pool out of other clouds, we should be able to run GPU systems on other public cloud providers if needed. | Could use MacStadium for Macs | Best approach is to do everything inside containers | Trying to get better information on pricing | Already have a LF organization on Docker Hub, could get ASWF specific org | Are we looking at testing on multiple GPU or driver versions? On Azure we only have access to a very specific GPU. Daniel: early on we would be happy with “any GPU”. There’s a good opportunity for us to use the CI to build the matrix of GPUs / drivers. | Larry: for now OpenColorIO just needs to be able to run “modern OpenGL”. Mac also needs OpenGL, but may have to switch to Metal. | Andrew: all Azure GPUs are Tesla. Larry: some projects (current or future) will want to run CUDA code. | Existing LF/ASWF CI infrastructure does have access to GPU on Linux/Windows on OpenStack public cloud provider | Will use containers to get RHEL/CentOS environment on the Ubuntu agent pool | Need to experiment, how to interact with component repositories for simpler experimentation | Jenkins system already has Docker workflows. | Could use existing Jenkins docker staging system with other CI systems | . | Container approach helps to not be strongly tied to any one CI solution. | . | . | Technical Project updates (0:30-0:50) . | OpenVDB . | Dan: 6.1 released recently, complete overhaul of CMake build system, much more modern now. Deprecating a lot of older functionality, with a more formal mechanism for deprecating older functionality. | Migration to CircleCI, in tandem with CMake overhaul. Aloys created prototype of how this would work on Azure. | CI supports WIndows and Linux, no Mac or Maya builds. | Cleaning up warnings. | Dealing with flow of issues reported by users on different platforms, newer compilers. Want to build wider range of configurations to catch those issues. | Looking at VFX Reference Platform CY2020. | CII badge hold ups: . | User feedback mechanism | Static analysis (will come after move to Azure) | Security and vulnerability | . | Looking at likely 6.2 release around SIGGRAPH time with some big new features. | . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: still working on Azure pipeline setup, not a ton of progress. Looking at using Docker images. | Actively working on correcting embedded external dependencies. Script to download dependencies into a directory in the build location which CMake can build and patch as needed. Want to make building OCIO as simple as possible while adhering to ASWF licensing requirements. | New feature from Autodesk merged last week: support for dynamic parameters in processors, can use GPU renderer with uniforms. Currently supports only display transformations but plan to expand. | Issues with Azure? Michael: there’s a ASWF Docker Hub account, can OCIO still use the ASWF Docker Hub before the repo has been moved to ASWF GitHub? Andrew: yes, but he would need admin privileges / keys to the ASWF Docker Hub repo (required to push images to Docker Hub). All access tokens had to be revoked 2 weeks ago due to security breach. | No authentication tokens needed to pull Docker images from Azure. | Larry: we should have a set of pre-built Docker images based on VFX Reference Platform years. Andrew: we probably need a repo for the Docker container configurations. Also build recipes for external components used by our projects. | . | OpenEXR . | Larry: TSC on hiatus due to vacations, but pick up in 2 weeks. Should have been activity by next TAC meeting. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: making progress on the transfers to ASWF. TSC now has 5 members with a good variety of people. | Finalizing repository migration. | Figuring out how CLAs are going to work | About ready to migrate to the ASWF mailing lists | Started on CII badge process (see TAC readme) | New TSC members joined a week ago so still ramping up. | Should be able to pull together initial roadmap and priority list soon. | Daniel: does OpenCue want to draw on experiences of other projects? Brian: work is required on how the internal scheduling algorithm works, so would be good to get input on that. | . | . | VFX Reference Platform 2020 Draft (0:50-0:55) . | Details | VFX Platform 2020: main thing is Python 3. Larry asked about compiler versions. Daniel: AL feels we should move forward with compiler versions fairly aggressively. | Extension of platform to other operating systems: which version, which compiler? | Kimball: 10% performance boost from switching to LLVM8 using gcc headers, seems to generate better code. Larry: SPI builds with CLangs with old gcc headers for compatibility. Should VFX Platform tackle this, or should this be a recommended practice from ASWF. We should give people a bit more guidance / leaway, wasteful for everyone to have to figure this out separately. | Daniel: use of the RedHat Developer Toolset (DTS) compiler with peculiar approach of allowing newer C++ extensions while still being able to link to older system libraries gets complicated / fragile. Decoupling compiler version requirement vs binary compatibility would be useful for everything. Right now they build most things with DTS, but more modern compilers for in-house, performance critical projects. | Jeff: also run into problems mixing compilers, they prefer safe approach of sticking with recommended compiler. | . | Next meeting . | 5 June 2019 | Daniel on leave for next 3 weeks, will hand over chair duties to someone | . | .

    "content": ". | No preset agenda | Larry: in the process of having to duplicate OpenEXR headers in OSL, would be nice to fix up | Could speak to Nick Porcino about Boost Python in Windows build | Larry: where should we be with minimum CMake version? Kimball: still hoping to work on Cmake recipes repo. | There are version links between Cmake and Boost? | We need to line up releases for SIGGRAPH for ASWF marketing | Emily: want to do press releases for new versions ahead of SIGGRAPH to drive people to sessions / BOFs. In process of building pages on web site to list activities at the show, schedule is pretty close to final. Not putting up the Wednesday schedule since it’s smaller groups. Lunch time event: meet the maintainers, invite project leads from across the industry, also board members who can make it (90m). | Open Source day at JW Marriott | RSVP pages on web site, invites to mailing lists, some more targeted invites | Marketing assets: website logos, social media graphics, t-shirts, stickers | TAC meeting on Wednesday, still to be locked down | Emily: putting together agenda for open source maintainers meeting, need recommendations for external projects, invitations to be sent from someone who have one on one relations | Mike: CI update for OCIO: pull request in GitHub for Azure Pipelines / SonarCloud / gcov, being refined based on feedback, covers 3 platforms, Docker containers for Linux, native for Mac and Windows. Docker based on what Dan did for OpenVDB. Will share the results of the discussion on email thread to TAC list. Azure Pipelines free went much faster than Travis / CircleCI (6 min instead of 30), which is great. Expanded a lot on what Travis and AppVeyor were doing, configuration looks more verbose but takes advantage of more functionality. Next major milestone would be to connect a non-free GPU instance (could be Windows to test DirectX and OpenGL on same host) for GPU accelerated testing. GPU accelerated VMs could come from another cloud provider if needed. | Emily: is OCIO v2 to be announced at SIGGRAPH? Mike: no hard date yet, probably still a year of work, so can talk about new work / projects, but too early for an official announcement, still focused on 1.x releases. | John: OpenVDB and OpenColorIO making progress on CII badging, hopefully by SIGGRAPH we should have a couple of projects close to meeting all requirements (hangup typically on designated security expert). | Ending early . | Next meeting . | 19 June 2019 | Daniel on leave for next 3 weeks, will hand over chair duties to John | . | .

Large number related to CMake / build system, CMake more than anything else. | Kimball is working on a CMake standard template projects | Repo transition to ASWF github transition? Not clear date yet, and not yet completely clear on what is required for this to happen.

Created an image for each project and a base image, Linux builds now using these Docker images. | SonarCloud is integrated as well. | Outstanding issue on external dependencies: Michael to take this project on, moving GitHub repo into ASWF organization. | John helped to move the web site to https, working on CII badge requests. CI pull request will also address a lot of CII requirements. | . | OpenVDB . | Dan: primarily looking at Azure Pipelines, building on top of Aloys work for Docker images. | Outstanding pull request on ASWF docker image, small issues, pulling different pieces of software from package managers vs building from source. | Minor issue related to GLFW library | Everything else is building correctly, unit tests are running | Merging this pull request once happy | Will start to expand the Docker image to include VFX Reference Platform | Some experimentation on personal Azure account to address Houdini builds, cannot be included in the public Docker image. | Andrew: Azure Pipelines provides private container registries. Dan: currently using Docker Hub. | Set up quick test with registry keys for private Docker image repo | Images can be lighter if we pre-download Houdini and only extract the libraries we need, could also have an image with multiple Houdini versions. | Windows / Mac builds, SonarCloud integration still on todo list | Looking at security-related issues, no reported issues so far (easy to meet that CII criteria), but working on a document about the security posture of OpenVDB, will be added to the repo (TSC directory). | . | Next meeting . | 3 July 2019 | . | .

At least one project graduation. | Static analysis update | CVE reporting | OpenColorIO may be able to get to CII certification, OpenVDB has also made progress, so should hopefully 1, maybe 2 projects eligible for graduation by SIGGRAPH. | TAC will need to vote on project graduation (meeting or via email), governing board also needs to approve. | . | July: Dependency management. | . | . | SIGGRAPH (0:05-020) . | ASWF events and involvement . | Encourage people to RSVP so we can get sense of turnout | Schedule confirmed for wednesday meetings, Emily will be sharing graphic to send out | TAC meeting invite has been sent out, schedule can be changed | TAC members encouraged to attend OSS Maintainers meeting | Inviting other open source project maintainers, trying to get as many as possible | Encouraged to recommend people, spreadsheet sent to email list | DigiPro: we have the option to have a table, Emily will not be present, if someone wants to man the table that would be appreciated and better credibility. | Larry: is this only during the breaks? Yes, nothing happens outside the single session track. | Same during Open Source day, would be good to have people to man tables / hang around to ask questions. | Brian: need to coordinate events with other Google events. | There will be AV available. | Need to RSVP for “Beers of a Feather” event | . | OSS Maintainers meeting . | ASWF + non ASWF projects: connect with other people doing OSS projects in the industry. Primary goal is NOT recruiting, use as opportunity to learn how we can support the broader community. Other events to promote ASWF membership. | Fairly small audience, 35-40 seats, invitation based. Best if invitation comes from people who already have connections to projects. Please add suggestions on the spreadsheet being circulated. | John suggesting we should prime the agenda with points from survey being circulated to invitees. | Daniel will be busy at SIGGRAPH with ASWF and other commitments, reached out to Larry to help lead the session. | Emilly: projects that have good talking points about benefits / impact of ASWF membership should share those. Will send template of what kind of talking points would be helpful. By July 12th. | Cary: some of the updates for OpenEXR may only drop very close to SIGGRAPH (CII badge for instance) | Every project should be represented at the ASWF BoF. | . | . | Technical Project updates (0:20-0:40) . | OpenVDB . | Dan: all remaining CII items ticked off except static analysis. | SonarCloud builds are working, not discussed impact in TSC meeting yets. | SonarCloud raised issue of an empty “catch” statement (as 5 separate security issues). Trying to understand the meaning / importance of this report. | Takes quite a long time to run, especially the code coverage (2.5 hours to run through test suite). So can’t be used on every commit, but that’s not required for CII badge. | Some of the language of static analysis says that static analysis must be applied to major production release, that hasn’t been done before, but would be applied to next one. | Andy: suggestion is that you don’t need to run it all the time, but running it once a week (or even month) is enough to meet CII badge requirements. We can set up the CI system to run it automatically on a regular schedule. | Major release planned for SIGGRAPH, so that release could be done under the CII badge process. Dan: release will actually happen after SIGGRAPH. | Dan: can run SonarCloud in non-automated way for now. Daniel: enough to meet CII requirement. | Requirement to address vulnerabilities relates to official, reported (CVE) vulnerabilities. | . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: getting ready to merge updates that redo CI and static analysis, working with Dan and Aloys to get this set up. | Will allow to update lots of requirements for CII badge | 80% of CII badge for now | Still need to address security-related issues being discussed on TAC list | Embedded external dependencies: being resolved in CMake / install scripts, expect to be done in a week or so. | Shouldn’t be a huge deal to get worked out | Dan: are you using the ASWF Staging Images? Michael: yes, also using the base image and installing their dependencies on top of that. | SonarCloud run takes about 30min, coverage takes the most time | Could there be two levels of SonarCloud, usual static analysis on every build, then a full coverage analysis once a week / before major release? | Michael: running full analysis over weekends, could be divided. | Daniel: collaboration between projects to help with these efforts is really encouraging. | Dan suggested adding “long names” to make sure that headers aren’t being tested multiple times in every place they are included. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: Quiet TSC month in June due to travel / vacation, getting back into it this month, plus SIGGRAPH. | Some good progress on the transfer of the project, repo is transfered, CLA is in place, domains are transferred. Only remaining part is CI system. | Had talked about transferring Jenkins system, but it looks like Azure Pipelines system would work fine, so that’s likely where the project will end up. Enough similarity in the job description languages. | Majority of recent contributions from third parties, one contributor added Python 3 compatibility to a component, so very encouraging. | Next on the list: working on the CII badge, made progress on unit test coverage. Will be working through other badge requirements over coming weeks. | SIGGRAPH is next big thing, scheduling challenges with Google events, in process of getting resolved. Should have proposed agendas for events next week, will circulate to TSC. | Based on contributions, issues and list discussions, it seems there are people using OpenCue in production, enough to find and fix issues. Hard to tell the exact user base. Should there be a survey at the BoF? Yes, primary goal to figure out what the community is, finding priorities and turning it into roadmap. | . | OpenEXR . | Larry: in OpenEXR older CVEs are not easily reproducible, or misuse from the calling program rather than the library itself. How do you get rid of a CVE when you think “it’s not your fault”. Cary: has some leads on some security folks, but how do you make sure that the CVE database at Mitre.org gets updated to note that something has been fixed? Wants to speak to an expert before submitting updates. | There’s a CVE from 2006 without instructions on how to reproduce. There’s an EXR file that’s claimed to crash Safari but is no longer reproducible. Daniel: clang-ASan is a good tool to address this. | Some of the CVEs have valgrind logs attached to them | CII badge currently at 76%. Kimball has changes to address all compiler warnings, on the cups of being warning free. | Security issues: one is addressed in upcoming release, one is being discussed how to fix. Others have been addressed in previous releases, so need to update the documentation | First pass on SonarCloud by Christina, working on coverage now, looking forward to coverage report. She will reach out to Dan to get the Azure PIpelines setup sync’ed up. | Working on slide deck for SIGGRAPH BoF. | Hoping to have a release out, or at least announce an upcoming release. | Want to discuss the reorganization of the repo at the BoF, especially splitting out imath component. | Also want to review the discussion from last year: standardization of metadata, support for a fast / lightweight version of the library for apps that don’t need the full functionality. | Spent time looking at 100% GitHub issues, lots are related to Python bindings to OpenEXR. There are external projects that aren’t part of OpenEXR project itself, but issues are being reported against the OpenEXR projects. Is there an opportunity to leverage the ASWF to try to coordinate with these “adjacent” projects? | John: these are open source projects? Cary: yes. An example: “pip install openexr” fails. But that’s not part of the OpenEXR project itself. | John: do we know the maintainers of these projects? | Larry: suggests people use OpenImageIO for Python bindings to OpenEXR | Kimball has CMake updates, any consensus on minimal CMake version for projects? Pushing for 3.11 which is included in RHEL 8, would prefer 3.12. Larry: does it matter? | Larry: has been reporting this issue for a long time in context of VFX Platform. | Can have multiple CMake versions in parallel. | FindPython has been changed in recent CMake. | Daniel: do we need to support alternate code paths for different versions of CMake. | Kimball: 3.11 has full support for cppcheck static analysis. | Dan: OpenVDB figured minimum Ref Platform supported (2017) and earliest CMake version from that year. | Wants to discuss it at the BoF | Cary: looking at the GitHub issues, it’s built on a lot of obscure platforms, issues filed by packagers on various Linux distros. Lots of communities that care about building OpenEXR that are not represented at the TAC, how do we reach these people? Is there a better forum? Openexr-dev mailing list is one. | Daniel: this is a tricky issue, good topic for the BoF. We may need to use our individual contact networks to try to reach some people. | Maybe at Linux-related, non ASWF events? | . | . | CI updates (0:40-0:50) . | Working group | . | Next meeting . | 17 July 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Welcome new member: Sean Looper (AWS) | Welcome new project: OpenTimelineIO (Pixar) | Review of Year 1 . | Goals and progress . | 5 projects, one graduated, good progress on CI system | . | Friction points . | Cary: security seems to remain a concern, need to consult with an expert. Sean: AWS might be able to provide some resources. Cary: having a security expert give a presentation to the TAC would be helpful. We had that for the CII badge, but want it more focussed to security per se. May need to create a security working group. We understand the code and the security implications, but how do we handle reports where a low probability compromise would result in a large performance hit? | Cary: Google suggested the oss-fuzz project be applied to OpenEXR, we decided that the 2 week bug report period was beyond our abilities to deal with. | Larry: is there a way we can run the oss-fuzz ourselves without turning on the actual “service” so we get an idea of our exposure? How often would we expect to get reports? | Brian: Google runs it internally due to internal use of OpenEXR. | OpenEXR does have fuzz testing, but they take hours to run. | Brian: has been looking for security resource internally, but hasn’t found one yet. | Daniel: we need to set the norms for our own projects, and understand the processes for updating a CVE report (for instance). | Larry: we probably don’t need a lot of handholding, just having a checklist we can rundown would be a good start, we could do that ourselves. We may not need a lot of long term “hand holding”. | Daniel: we can rely on internal resources, or try to hire an external consultant. | Gordon: non airgapped applications (operating systems) are using our projects, so “security is coming for us” whether we like it or not. Our goals for next year should be broader than the CII badge. | Sean: what would be the expectations from a security expert from a member company: regular cadence review board, a visit to discuss best practices? | Daniel: really we’re looking for clarity on approaches, someone we can go through the details of how this would apply to our projects. But also need someone with ongoing responsibility, integrate into CI infrastructrure. | Gordon: we need to establish our security posture, how do we respond. | CVE fixes are often one line fixes, but how do you communicate back that something was fixed in a specific version. | Sean: having a security expert “on call” without compromising their day job commitments. | . | . | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Diversity . | Daniel: we’ve discussed diversity goals but have not made progress. What mechanisms do we have, and what should we seek to do. | Cary: realized the TSC needs more people, we need to look around ourselves for more than just “the usual suspects”. One of the benefits of participating are the networking opportunities, which is something attractive to offer. Also opportunity to nurture “future generation”. | Erik: What are the specific goals for diversity, many of our member organizations have formal internal efforts in that respect. | Larry: some of us represent projects, so of us represent member companies, but we’ve been involved in this field for a while. Getting people involved with projects and the TSCs for the projects is a way to bring more diversity to the TAC. | John: TAC is open body, anyone is welcome to attend / participate, the only restriction is on voting of project acceptance. | Erik: excluding people from voting can be awkward… | Gordon: Autodesk hired a director of diversity, could organize to have this person present to us what that implies? General agreement that this would be a good idea. | Sean: are we trying to make the whole group more diverse or voting members? Or projects? Yes to all. | Emily: we should set a formal group that each TSC + TAC has at least one person who meets diversity requirements. | . | TAC chair election . | TAC chair tenure is one year, and comes up in September. | . | Gordon: do we want to have a goal on the number of projects? | Emily: should we have a more formal survey of our community, above the simple straw poll from the ASWF SIGGRAPH BoF.. | Gordon: Foundation has been running for a year, are we going to survey the community to learn how we’ve done? Yes, this is happening (John). | John: presenting straw poll results from ASWF BOF. What should ASWF solve for Open Source projects: . | Legal Framework | Versionitis | … | . | Open source projects that should be submitted: . | USD | OIIO | Rez | OpenSubdiv | Aces | DJV | …. | . | Seems a bit like “what project do you like”? Larry: there’s definitely something to people wanting to see USD. | Areas of new development: . | Media Player | Metadata | Imath extracted from OpenEXR | Rig exchanging | Asset management | Context management | Compositor | Monitor calibration | Fabric Engine replacement | Cloud Services | … | . | Gordon: seems a lot of these could be grouped under “rigging”. | Any other areas ASWF should concentrate on: . | VFX Reference Platform: what does this mean? Erik: we should be clearer about the dependencies / overlap with VFX Reference Platform | 4 or 5 choices related to documentation | Licensing considerations (GPL vs non GPL) | Need further consolidation of results | . | Gordon: there’s value in the physical manifestation of the VFX Reference Platform (Aloys Docker containers). Daniel: need further specifications (compiler flags..). | Survey results: majority of people attending “beers of a feather” and “open source day” not directly involved with open source projects. | Gordon: Autodesk has customers in multiple industries, including games. There’s a desire to have consistency / interchange between VFX and games, doing a lot of outreach to the games industry. Daniel: have had people from the games industry reach out, so there does seem to be interest. Epic is a member of ASWF. We recognize that the game toolset is increasingly part of our toolsets. There are amazing projects going on in the games industry, there’s value in getting more exposure to what’s happening there. | Sean: if our members say that a media player is their top priority, how should that influence our priorities? Daniel: we don’t prioritize specific types of projects, we haven’t initiated a project from scratch, but that’s not impossible. But “wide scale industry adoption” (if only potential) remains an important criteria. | Emily: additional working groups may be appropriate to address results of the survey (straw poll or more formal survey). | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenTimelineIO . | Joshua: Need to offline figure out their next steps, lots of work to be done. Talking to other projects about how their TSC is structured since that needs to be created. When people are on the TSC / TAC are they representing as an individual or their company? Wasn’t clear from reading all the charters. Need help for onboarding. John: can definitely help with that, can be worked offline. Gordon: should be captured in FAQ. John: yes. Cary: join one of the other TSC meetings to see how it goes. | Have a pretty clear idea of the future roadmap, know the Pixar and other contributors, but would like to get some ideas from software vendors, to help drive native implementations. For instance was OpenEXR support a “push” or “pull” model. Gordon: Autodesk creative finishing group is very interested, can provide names of people who would be interested, possibly joining TSC. Joshua: sometimes can be difficult to get companies to engage in public discussion. Daniel: Linux Foundation can help with that. Sean: should there be an official mechanism for that (i.e. interacting with commercial vendors). Erik: members of the foundation who represents customers of these packages have influence, and should try to tell vendors that they want this functionality. Sean: providing a mechanism for “matchmaking” between users and software vendors. We can enable the project maintainers, and help them communicate with vendors. Gordon: the most compelling story is when you can show great workflows. Sean: vendors want to see actual demand from industry. Daniel: ASWF offers a number of mechanisms, both formal and informal. | Developers inside facilities often “don’t know what they don’t know” with respect to security. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: Very interesting SIGGRAPH so far, great turnout at Open Source Day BoF. Lots of interest, lots of sidebar conversations. But not a lot of actual adoption. Not unexpected, new project, lots of work to switch render queue systems. Need to focus on actual adoption going forward. | Focus on documentation, deployments, workflows. Looking for ideas in that area. | Collected a lot of feature requests from Q&amp;A, long list of features to work on. But new features may not drive actual adoption. | Proper Windows support is high on the list. | Fully migrated to Azure Pipelines. Was caught off guard by transition from a single Jenkins instance to a build system without persistence (rebuilding Docker images from scratch taking more time). | Progress on CII badge, finished initial pass through, 83% so far. Looking at static analysis and unit tests. | Will publish a roadmap for the next while based on feedback from SIGGRAPH events. Will dictate what Google’s work will be focussed on, and what others might want to work on. | Daniel: laying out roadmaps that identify specific areas where external contributors and work is a good idea. | . | OpenVDB . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: good turnout at BoF, was good that it followed ACES. Gave update on incubation status, about ready for graduation vote. Completed CII badge requirements, need to rerun license scan. | Two outstanding pull requests for licensing and contributors. | Most of the licensing related issues have been addressed. | Daniel: any traction on resourcing? Michael: Method offered some help with documentation, Netflix may be interested in contributing as well. | Efforts at identifying “first issues” for new contributors. | Patrick: CI build system is running, SonarCloud static analysis. A lot of false positives, trying to fix the ones that are relevant, but that generates a lot of noise, especially for security related issues. Would be helpful to get guidance there. | Is there an ideal way to respond to static analysis false positives? Comments in the code, or squelching results in SonarCloud? What if we disagree with what SonarCloud is reporting? | You can add comments to disable some warnings. | Larry: not much choice but to look at what’s reported. | Long term would be great if a “clean” SonarCloud report would be used to gate builds that break it. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: good session yesterday. | CII badge: getting close. Azure / Sonar Cloud is up and running. As soon as the latest build issue is fixed will make new release. | A couple of people have reached out from the community and will attend next TSC. | . | . | CI updates . | Working group | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 14 August 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Welcome new members [0:00 - 0:10] . | Sean McDuffee (Intel) . | Working with Jim Jeffries, used to be at Blue Sky in R&amp;D dept, working on rendering and simulation, 8 shows over last 10 years. Joined Intel 2 months ago, enthusiastic about ASWF. | . | Pilar Molina (Blue Sky Studios) . | Senior Software Engineer in R&amp;D Dept, works with Mark McGuire, animation and rigging tools, has worked closely with Animal Logic and Autodesk on Maya/USD | . | Michael Min (Netflix) . | Will be representing Netflix on the TAC, will get up to speed on the documentation, based in the LA office. | . | . | SIGGRAPH recap [0:10 - 0:20] . | ASWF BoF . | John: feedback from attendees, we had around 300-400 attendees, very satisfying turnout, great work from Emily on organization. At lot of great engagement questions. Demographics profile: beers of a feather: 50/50 split between familiar/involved with ASWF and new, similar profile for Open Source Day. Plurality of attendees not involved in specific projects, getting lots of new people “in the room”, individual projects need to work on bringing in some of these new people. Highest priorities perceived: build/CI environment, versionitis, shared legal framework. Most “popular” projects which should become ASWF projects: USD, OIIO, Rez, OpenSubdiv, ACES… Strong interest in an open source media player, metadata initiatives, imath as a standalone project… Also very strong interest in tighter connection between ASWF and VFX Reference Platform, as well as focussing on documentation. | Sean: are we expecting to pick some topics and create working groups? Daniel: yes, we can create working groups to address some specific topics such as documentation, but for something like a media player, other models may be more effective, for instance identify a specific existing project or product that could be adopted / supported / open sourced. Kimball: there are several media players, we should identify what specific features we need (scripting for instance) | . | OSS Maintainers meeting . | Larry (meeting host): several maintainers of other projects in our ecosystem, as well as leaders of ASWF projects. Somewhat informal discussion on “hot topics”, 2 main take aways: . | A good chance to get people from other projects to see what ASWF can do (especially CI system) without it being a “selling opportunity” | Discussion centered around general problems faced by all projects: how to keep a healthy level of developer contribution, especially from studios using the project. Also recruiting, and how to encourage some diversity, how do you get new blood coming into the projects, all projects are facing the same types of issues. | . | Daniel: some good examples from other projects of useful initiatives: . | Cloud Native Compute Foundation: https://landscape.cncf.io/ | Effort to revive “Open Source VFX” web site | Examples of documentation: project level, as well as cross project initiatives | . | For non-ASWF projects: looking for high resolution logos to replace PNGs with SVGs (for scalability), to update Open Source VFX web site | Imageworks has some projects that aren’t on the Open Source VFX web site, would be good to get updates on these projects so they can be added | BoF videos will be up on YouYube in a few days | . | TAC retrospective and prospective . | Security experts (Sean, Kimball) . | Kimball: Dan Hutchison was working as security engineer before The Foundry, has offered to help | Sean: looking for additional context on how to engage with group of security experts, should this be a working group with ad hoc cadence, or something less formal. Daniel: will work with Sean to come up with a working model, we tried a few different approaches early on, but were lacking the resources back then. | . | . | . | Technical Project updates [0:20 - 0:45] . | OpenCue . | Gathering feedback from SIGGRAPH to merge into project plan | Ramping up new TSC members, having design discussions | Priority to make progress on CII badge, initial pass is complete. Static analysis / SonarCloud setup in progress, also working on increasing test coverage. CII badge is forcing emphasis on test coverage, which is great. | Velocity on accepting external contributions is not as high as desired due to lack of test coverage. | Chatting with Linux Foundation RelEng to merge with ASWF SonarCloud org instead of using personal one. | Have we agreed on the general level of test coverage required for CII badge? Have any of the other projects set a benchmark? Michael: OCIO aiming for 80%, Kimball: OpenEXR at 82%. Brian: 80% sounds like a place to start. | Starting to use ASWF base Docker Images, nothing in there covers Java / JDK, should there be? Daniel: a good topic for the CI working group? (CI working group not wrapped up, just looking at necessary cadence going forward) | . | OpenTimelineIO . | Cory: no specific updates, back from vacation, need to follow up with Josh to gather SIGGRAPH feedback, questions on how to form the TSC. Will update at the next meeting. Daniel: has been involved in a couple of conversations. | . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: completed all the requirements to pass license scan, except for some exceptions that need to be approved by governing board. John: agreed, overall in pretty good shape. | Michael: some work on updating licensing statements in source code, such as using SPDX. When is it OK to replace copyright notices? Will talk to Autodesk and Imageworks to see if those statements can be completely replaced. | Ready to move project over to ASWF GitHub org, but waiting for some CLAs to be signed, don’t want project to get blocked because of those. | . | OpenVDB . | No representatives on call | . | OpenEXR . | Kimball: narrowing down last few bugs to get Azure Pipelines running on all 3 platforms, will then tag for 2.4.0 release. | Added a couple of static functions, thus 2.4.0, hopefully by Labor Day | 95% on CII badge | Daniel: any further discussion on “imath library extraction” based on SIGGRAPH feedback? Kimball: no further discussions past SIGGRAPH in OpenEXR TSC. Larry: might want to extend the discussion to the TAC, and maybe take a specific position? Daniel: seems that CI integration / next release are the current priorities. | Eric: what was the specific feedback at the BoF regarding this split? Larry: no extensive discussion at the BoF, the vector/matrix stuff wasn’t controversial, but should we also split off “half”, is there an alternative FP16 format to be supported? Machine Learning apps tend to use a different format (that was new information). Not ready to elevate that to the TAC level. | Larry: need to make sure that anything that is done with Half is compatible with what happens in CUDA. | . | . | CI updates [0:45 - 0:50] . | Working group goals / cadence . | Migration into ASWF orgs from personal (Sonar etc) . | Access privileges | Andy: Brian requested connecting up Sonar Cloud, best to do this via tickets, but will create “committer groups” that will have admin rights for their repositories. | Also “Self service committer promotion”, can automate via a YAML files. Trying to standardize between Gerrit and GitHub. | Andy: Can add marketplace apps that can help with that. | Andy: self service repository creation via adding a file to a “control” repo, would help ASWF be more agile without having to rely on RelEng group for some of these connections / infrastructure. | . | Documentation | Base images: extend to include more components (e.g. Java) | Windows, Mac, GPU | Commercial components for build and test | Daniel: suggesting a monthly cadence for CI working group to make room for other initiatives | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | From survey results . | Media player . | Does anyone know the DJV people? | Larry: what do people want from a “media playback” tool? Do they really want a playback tool, or a collaborative dailies platform? | Sean: should we re-evaluate the survey, distill the data down to a new list, some kind of “mutually exclusive” results? | Larry: we don’t know who asked for this, not a single person at a studio. Hesitant to put a lot of time into something that got voted on somewhat casually. | Kimball: can we follow up with people who attended the events? Larry: at least post on the public TAC email list, if no one responds, then we probably don’t need to even think about it. | Gordon: do we know how many votes this got? Larry: not clear what that means. Gordon: how do we better act on this data. | John: can send the governing board slide deck to the TAC after this meeting. Also will post raw data as CSV. | Gordon: action item for next call to review the raw data? | John: we can also do a follow up larger survey to hone in better on what the data means. | . | John: talked to a few people as to what they meant by “metadata” answers: common interchange formats, common metadata interop between tools. Sean: also metadata captured on set and how to deal with that. But not clear what that means in the context of ASWF, and what that could translate to in practice. | John: “Documentation” should also be clarified. | Rez | Rigging / Evaluation | . | . | Next meeting . | 28 August 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Governing Board Update [0:00-0:05] . | BOF videos from SIGGRAPH now on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZw_4upNTdoGjQfvim_5MhA | Some of the requests from SIGGRAPH meetings conveyed to the Governing Board | Finalizing goals for the first year, David Morin’s term ends end of September | Still have change to make TAC goals from first year | Asked about financing for GPU testing: funds can be made available for setup and experimentation, but should follow up on offers from member companies for free or subsidized resources. Can take advantage of resources from external providers since they can be linked to Azure Pipelines CI. | Cary: Request for clear mission statement from projects (from Rob Bredow): each project should have a clear statement of scope, what it is, what it’s not, what are the boundaries. Could be included in documentation project. | . | Goals for TAC: Year 2 [0:05-0:15] . | Ongoing . | Previous CI and TAC calls: | . | Member survey (Gordon) . | Gordon pointed out the importance of serving the needs of our members. Surveys to augment our representative structures, kicked off process with John to find ways to gather this data (augment free form survey data from SIGGRAPH). Also make these processes less ambiguous, also ask members to consider “relative value” when submitting lists of priorities (the $100 test). | . | Security. Working Group? . | Making space for a working group by moving CI working group to a every 4 week cadence. Is anyone interested in starting up this process? | Kimball: started conversations with Daniel at Foundry | . | Kimball: Graduation of “senior” projects | Cary: need to make progress on Diversity and Inclusion. Explicit targets and metrics. | Larry: now that we have several projects in and more coming in, may be time to work on social aspects, normalizing the idea that people in studios should be contributing to the projects as part of their normal work. Daniel: Governing Board indicating that in the second year we should be more formal about drawing on engineering commitments of member companies. Larry: make sure that members are fulfilling their obligations, and normalizing the idea of not just fulfilling commitments, but also cutting the red tape to contribution. Could start to identify the barriers to contribution, even casual contributions (few line bug fixes) can be very difficult to clear / get approved. Cary: broadening the community base in our projects would help this as well, avoid “single points of failure”. Need to make sure that people aren’t scared of contributing by the legal hurdles. Daniel: another opportunity for a survey to figure out what are the obstacles to contribution. In the OSS Maintainers meeting at SIGGRAPH some of these topics were discussed, as well as how to reach out to a wider base of contributors (students for instance), but also trying to “unlock” experts in studios using these projects. | . | Documentation [0:15-0:20] . | aswf.io updates . | John: working on a landscape view of projects in our industry, trying to revive opensourcevfx.org web site | Emily: updates to aswf.io web site, adding to project documentation practices. Added more community content, need a section for CI, each project will have a separate page, currently just links to the project site, but will have specific pages linking to mailing list, repository. | Some of the project web sites need updates, there isn’t a good central place to get to all our projects. Would Confluence be a solution, or should we stick to GitHub as the single source of truth? Here’s an example: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/ which aggregates the status of a number of related projects. Hyper Ledger is similar to ASWF as an organization. | Will be creating some assets on GitHub: logos, slides… | . | CI (JF) | Projects (graduation requirement?) . | From OSS Maintainers meeting: we should make use of a documentation system / documentation quality requirement a criterion for project graduation. Some aspects are covered by CII requirements. Michael: OCIO has documentation, but project has changed rapidly, so hard to keep it up to date. Should demonstrate a “pattern” of documentation improvement. Kimball: do we mean something like Doxygen / ReadTheDocs / Sphinx for technical documentation? Larry: really likes ReadTheDocs / Sphinx, folds nicely into our CI philosophy, docs live within the source tree, system will rebuild the documentation on a commit. Also looks esthetically pleasing. Andrew: LF uses ReadTheDocs across multiple projects they manage, including internal RelEng documentation. Can do cross-project linking. Henry: it’s a good idea to indicate a level of expectation of documentation for our projects, reasonably up to date documentation. We have expectations of code quality, that should extend to documentation. Not sure if we want to prescribe a particular documentation system, should cover technical doc, user doc, and contributor doc. | Mission statements, roadmaps for projects, needed to keep projects healthy. Do projects feel they currently have a clear mission statement, both used internally, and externally discoverable? Or should we work explicitly on that. | Cary: OpenEXR started a discussion about gather reference images, could use some photos for reference images, what would we use those for? Would be used for calibration, which sounds useful, but is OpenEXR the right home for this, and is this within scope of the project. So brought up the discussion of project scope. Also question of splitting off imath, would OpenEXR become a “two headed beast” if it ends up managing two separate projects? Again goes to defining scope and mission. | Josh: OTIO spoke about this internally, what is the scope of the project within Pixar, what does and doesn’t get open sourced. Wrote down a project “elevator pitch” rather than a “mission statement”, more “what is the project” rather than “what should the project be”. Have pushed back on some requests (media playback for instance), but project scope may grow over time, hopefully in a controlled manner. | . | . | Technical Project updates [0:20-0:40] . | OpenCue . | No representative | . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: refining licensing on project, waiting for approvals from Autodesk. Waiting for some license sign off from Governing Board. Last steps before applying for graduation vote. John: should hopefully happen next week. | . | OpenTimelineIO . | Josh: John has been helping form TSC, first meeting last week. 2 people from Pixar, one from Netflix. Next meeting tomorrow, people from Autodesk and Dreamworks interested. Looking for active contributors. Switched mailing list and Slack channel to ASWF infrastructure, going through the list. For the Technical Charter, looking at subtle differences between the other project charters, looking for guidance from other projects as to what required those changes. Larry: some of the differences are probably not that meaningful, but the result of haggling between legal departments and various contributors. | Got into some discussion with Avid asking for more involvement. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: release “waiting in the weeks”, discussions on Boost issues, should now have builds on every platform. Also trying to resolve some license questions, a pull request was issued against document discussing patent requirements, but probably shouldn’t hold up the release. Should allow finishing off remaining items for CII badge, and should be able to propose graduation within next couple of weeks. | . | OpenVDB . | No representatives | . | . | CI updates [0:40-0:50] . | Working group. 4 weekly cadence. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 11 September 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Welcome to new members . | Michael Johnson (Apple) | Gerald Tiu (Microsoft) . | Director of M&amp;E at Microsoft Azure, covers from scripts to post. Came from industry, worked at Pixar and ILM, excited to work on projects with industry partners. | . | . | Follow ups . | CI documentation and sample project? (JF) . | Nothing to share yet, but still committed to it. Will take shape of personal GitHub repo, then to be moved to ASWF when fleshed out. | Daniel suggest that the sample project (“teapot project”) could be used to demonstrate the use of existing ASWF projects (EXR, OCIO…). Show cross project dependencies, CI integration… Should this be a separate project to avoid mixing a project that demonstrates structure vs a project that demonstrates cross project integration. | Gordon: components designed to work within a larger framework, how compeling an example can you build by gluing these components together? | Sean: can we justify this project by connecting the dots between the ASWF projects and new projects that would fill the gaps? | Michael Min: how far do we want to scope this effort? | Cary: haven’t heard discussions about an objective to build a complete pipeline within the context of ASWF. | Daniel: there are other groups that have as a goal a fully open source production pipeline. Was suggesting a more modest goal to show a tutorial for developers. | Cary: had feedback about issues building OpenEXR as a sub-project of another CMake-based project. So more examples of CMake integration between projects would help. | Eric: a project that links all other projects is the hardest thing to compile | . | Member survey to guide TAC and CI efforts (Gordon) . | Take our ad hoc surveys a step further, survey done at SIGGRAPH was not easy to determine “which voices are we hearing”. | Propose as a first step to do a deeper dive on the raw data that was gathered. | What are the questions we want to answer? | What would be the right survey questions to answer that? | . | We should have a post mortem of how well we’ve delivered on the expected value of the member companies in the first year. | Asking these questions seems to be larger than just the TAC, should this topic involve / be driven by the Governing Board? Do such discussions exist? | Daniel: first year strategy nominally runs until end of tenure of David Morin, in the process (with Daniel) of formulating goals for next year. Interested in hearing feedback from the TAC: next steps for CI, project needs… So it’s a two way interaction. | Gordon: can work with David, Emily, John and Daniel to help define this to help put this together. | Raw data: https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/message/860 | . | . | Annual TAC chair election . | Daniel’s tenure ends in September, discussed with John a process to elect next TAC char, will send out a call for nominations via email list. If there are more than one candidate we will vote. | Anyone interested should reach out to Daniel to discuss what was involved. Estimate 4-5 hrs per week. | . | VOTE: OpenColorIO Graduation proposal . | https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/message/908 . | Michael Dolan sent out proposal (see link above) | Healthy committer base across vendors, VFX companies and individuals | Healthy flow of merges and commits | Completed CII badge | License scan completed (initial issues with embedded dependencies and their licenses) | ASWF has really helped with organization of governance and structure, documentation, contribution, security… Highly beneficial to the value of the project, and help new participation. | Value of OCIO to ASWF mission: project is well adopted in the industry, including outside the VFX industry (games). Speaks for itself. Looking forward to OCIO v2 next summer. | Daniel: project has been excellent at contributing to TAC process, CI system, setting of direction. | Andrew: project not yet migrated to ASWF GitHub, but will be done soon. | Quorum is met | Daniel proposes motion for graduation, Gordon seconds. | Many ayes, no abstains, no against. Motion passes unanimously, will be recommended to Governing Board for graduated status. | . | . | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | CI | Dependency management | Security expertise and processes | Documentation standards and standardization | Vector / matrix library | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB | OpenColorIO | OpenEXR . | Cary: beta release is out, feedback about CMake issues when building in context of larger CMake-based project. | Will be working on more disruptive changes. | Moving repo to ASWF GitHub waiting on CLA setup (business / legal) | Eager to move on splitting imath to separate project. Will touch on issues of whether it’s a separate, independent project, in a different repo with different license, CLA… Or is there a notion of a “dependant” project that shares infrastructure? | Could ASWF project inherit from a base project for some infrastructure (licensing / doc)? | . | OpenCue | OpenTimelineIO | . | CI updates . | GPU build agents – hosting? . | Not covered by free Azure build agents | Andrew: Azure Pipelines does not support a free pool of GPU builders. In talk with representatives at Azure Pipelines, where is Microsoft on roadmap with dynamic pool? | We (LF) have found a way to pretty easily deal with the cost model to manage Azure resources. Would be an option to spin up some managed pools. | Brings up issue of Jenkins environment: recommend to turn down that environment to save those costs. There’s a non trivial amount of work to spin up that infrastructure, takes about 2 days of work to spin up that environment. | Kimball: do we see ever needing Jenkins in the future? Andrew: OpenCue went to Azure Pipelines directly. | Kimball: move to decommission Jenkins, Larry seconds. | All Ayes, no opposed or abstain. Vote carries. Andrew to stand down the ASWF Jenkins infrastructure costs. | Sean: AWS would be happy to provide funding for GPU instances. Can use any resources for Azure Pipelines builds. | May need to use Mac Stadium for Mac GPU, but OCIO is happy with just Linux for now for their test suite. Doug: would be happy to test on Mac and Windows as well. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Rez | . | Blog . | Emily: launching ASWF blogs, call for participation went out on mailing list | . | Next meetings . | CI working group: 18 September 2019 | TAC: 25 September 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 [0:00 - 0:10] . | ASWF changing goal targets to align on calendar years . | Diversity and Inclusion targets . | In both TAC and projects . | Drawing up concrete targets as opposed to just an aspiration target . | Should be assigned as an area of responsibility, anyone interested in leading that effort? Wave: happy to help, asking what is involved in something like that? Daniel: perhaps create a working group (similar to CI group). Wave: maybe identify educational institutions that we could engage with. We need to define the ultimate goal: diversity within the group involved with ASWF, or the people we engage with? Daniel: all goals are on the table, we’re starting from pretty far behind. Most of our membership (TAC, project leadership) is not diverse. Could see this as an opportunity for engagement within our industry and with education. Could use ASWF associate membership model to reach out to other groups. Wave: also on board of Cartoon Art Museum in SF, dealing with similar issues, can reach out to leadership who are already working on this. Michael Min: there was a women in animation panel at SIGGRAPH, can reach out to organizers. Also can reach out to Women in Software meetup in LA last week. Larry: even the studios and R&amp;D teams in those studios is more diverse than ASWF / TAC, so should try to encourage internal people as well to get involved. Wave: will have something for next TAC meeting. Sean: we have individual TSCs, new working groups (security), so other opportunities for improving diversity. | . | Documentation, including mission statements . | ASWF landscape: ecosystem of VFX open source projects. Previously was opensourcevfx.org The CNCF created a tool to represent these landscapes which we are reusing for ASWF. Used projects either in opensourcevfx.org site and had some kind of GitHub repo you could point to (system only works for projects in GitHub). Also looked at lists from Disney and Sony. Larry categorized the projects. Gives an at-a-glance overview of open source activity. Also lets us identify gaps. There are some projects missing, and probably also dead projects that should be removed. CNCF threshold is that the project has to be related to the industry, also had to have a commit in last 6 months. Opensourcevfx added requirement that the project should have been used in an actual production. Where should we comment on this? Backed by GitHub, so can use GitHub commenting . | Template project (JF) Progress being made, feedback can be provided via GitHub. New items can be added as well. | Licenses for datasets and docs (John). Open Source projects typically use a Creative Commons license for documentation, images and other non code assets. For datasets the Linux Foundation as come up with the Community Data License with a permissive and a non permissive license. JF: how should we structure a dual license in a GitHub repo? John: using SPDX on each file to indicate which license they are under, can use SPDX as a comment in a MarkDown file. The code license is typically used to tag the overall GitHub repo, but will check with LF legal. Kimball: for datasets a separate repo is probably appropriate anyway. | Mission Statements: Need some good examples, guidance and structure for this. | . | Survey processes . | . | New members [0:10-0:15] . | Michael B. Johnson (Apple) aka “wave” . | Joined Apple last year after 23+ years at Pixar . | Pushed for ASWF membership . | Current plan to help with CI . | Trying to help with OpenTimelineIO team at Pixar . | Looking at contributing back OpenEXR security fixes. Larry: you are encouraged to join the OpenEXR TSC meetings to discuss these issues. | . | Dave Fellows (Microsoft) . | Engineering Manager at Azure, responsible for Azure Batch rendering service . | Team came from Microsoft acquisition 5 years ago, had a Renderman on demand service . | Looking forward to contribute to OpenCue, make it as easy as possible for studios to use rendering in the cloud. | Christian Smith on his team will be most engaged with OpenCue project. | Can answer questions about GPU usage on Azure. | . | . | Technical Project updates [0:15 - 0:35] . | OpenTimelineIO . | Joshua: having regular TSC meeting, good participation from Autodesk, Dreamworks and Netflix. | Autodesk is presenting proposal for universal coordinate system for spatial data . | Reached out to Avid and Apple to get some technical info on how to interoperate with FCP and Media Composer. | Instead of just “fixing” reports, trying to figure out what has already been done in the community. | Autodesk has done code review for RV integration. | . | OpenCue . | Added new TSC members: Microsoft and AWS, will help to make OpenCue a really good, cloud friendly scheduler. | . | OpenVDB . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: discussion for GPU testing, Sean has offered some resources (GPU nodes). | Michael: moving repo to ASWF GitHub organization next week . | . | OpenEXR . | From Cary via email: . | Release v2.4.0 is out, the first under the ASWF banner. | CII best practices badge is now at 100%. | OpenEXR-related CVE’s on https://cve.mitre.org have been updated with the most recent information, noting issues and corresponding releases. | still working our way through SonarCloud “bugs” so that our quality gate is no longer “failing” - they’re really more nits and annoyances than true “bugs”. | we’re in the process of scheduled a meeting with a security expert, Dan Hutchinson of Foundry. | next steps for adoptions: . | second pass at the license scan after a first round of cleanup . | official board approval of license exceptions . | mission statement . | . | . | . | Security . | Could stall quickly, like the last time we tried to spin up a working group . | Concrete action points from OpenEXR . | Attracting specific resources . | Cary: useful first step would be to center around next OpenEXR meeting with Dan Hutchinson from Foundry. Are there opportunities for generalization? . | Dave Fellows: is the scope security for all projects? Daniel: all projects, OpenEXR has some public CVEs so it has more exposure, and has been the first project looking at addressing security reports. OpenCue could have some pretty significant surface area, could see if security team in Azure could help. | Addition of Apple and Microsoft to ASWF should hopefully provide additional resources. | Kimball: still getting final confirmation for Dan Hutchison at OpenEXR TSC. | . | CI updates (Working Group) [0:35-0:45] . | Python3 . | DTS deprecation . | GPU builds and agents . | Maya, Houdini, Nuke runtime tests . | . | CMake best practice [0:45-0:50] . | CMakeTools or other cross-project sharing . | How to develop and propagate these best practices across our projects. | . | CPPCon 2019 talk by Craig Scott: Deep CMake for Library Authors (recording anywhere?) . | Would it be worth hiring as a consultant? . | Kimball: some patterns from OpenEXR should be documented in template project . | Daniel: Should we separate out the module discovery part of every projects? Kimball: initially thought we should separate it, but less convinced now. “Here’s a Docker image that has a Reference Platform installation” in it may be a better approach? Larry: has been reading the Professional CMake book, using it as a guide to overhaul his own projects, still in “Cmake 2” land, need modernization. Less clear on how shareable things are. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Joshua: developer for DJV is aware of ASWF, has been doing Windows fixes for OpenTimelineIO, so can arrange introduction if needed.

Gordon: might make sense to separate those audiences, could be a question at the start, or separate survey links? Emily: should have a single survey with a question “are you a member” at the start, and also “are you involved” (for people who are involved but not from member companies). | Larry: our analysis should try to boil down “one vote per member company” to make sure we deskew multiple answers from a single company? Gordon: try to avoid the “anonymous” answers from SIGGRAPH BoF. Maybe that’s why having separate links for members vs public at large would help with this? Larry: don’t want to be overly structured either. Disney has a single membership, but has multiple entities. Not clear how granular we want to be. | Emily: maybe this becomes two separate surveys, ask to share internally to our companies. But broader industry survey to see if there are gaps we need to be addressing. Our membership may not cover all aspects. Straw poll at SIGGRAPH BoF was attempt at getting feedback from outside our immediate circles. | Broader industry survey: open source use across the industry. | Daniel: we probably need to discuss this more via email, a few people seem to have expressed interest in this process. Quick discussion: what do we intend to do with this information. How do we show that we have taken on board the results of the surveys we have already done. We don’t want to keep asking people the same questions. Is it useful for us to produce some kind of “state of open source in the industry” document / summary. Similar to “state of DevOps” summary that goes out yearly. | https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/state-of-devops-report | . | Gordon: a lot of these questions we have not asked before. Make sure we capture all of the suggestions from previous surveys. Maybe the broader “state of the union of open source” needs to be a separate survey. We need to make sure that contributors view that they are “getting their money’s worth” of their efforts and contributions to ASWF. Although we may be repeating questions, knowing who is asking for what is important. | Larry: not clear we’ve gotten actionable feedback from SIGGRAPH survey. Daniel: also live polls during the summits. Gordon: do we have the results of those earlier polls? Larry: yes. But that data is 2 years old. Gordon: we only get one chance to ask for this data in the form we want. “Is this going to give us useful data to take action on”. Larry: we should ask to what extent they think they are filling their FTE commitments, andif not what are the blockers. Gordon: and what can we do to make it easier to contribute to ASWF. | Emily: how can we make the questions as specific as possible, ask specific questions so we have better insights / actionable data. | . | Diversity and Inclusion (Wave) . | Foundation, TAC and projects | External orgs . | CJANE | Women in film.org | Women in animation.org | Anita Borg / Grace Hopper conference | Phone calls to diverse industry members asking for recommends | Need to be careful about the message | Get a number of organizations, send to the TAC / governing board, “go look at these organizations, do you know anyone on their board / advisor lists, reach out and start a conversation”. | Michael Min: do we have an idea of what our message is supposed to be? Is there a specific objective, what are we trying to achieve? Wave: for now trying to identify relevant organizations who might have members / connections who could get involved in ASWF. We would like to get more voices, more points of view involved. Not prescriptive, but want to encourage “diversity of ideas”. Michael: are we trying to broaden the conversation, or trying to get more members / contributors from more diverse contributors? What would be the metrics? Wave: for now we should be looking at starting conversations. Example of ML-based software to look at gender roles in scripts at Disney. Maybe some of this is open sourced? | Wave: also can be helpful to look at membership of these organizations to establish links. | Emily: finding diverse contributors to open source is challenging, need to raise awareness. Could turn into a mentorship program. Are there goal in the TAC we want to set? Should each project have a woman on the TSC for instance? | Wave: gender is a good starting point, there are other “axis” to consider as well. | Pilar: should we be looking at quotas as well to set specific goals? | Emily: also putting together a list of relevant organizations, will send to TAC. Everyone should also add to the notes if they think of organizations. | . | Member orgs | Target setting | . | VFX Platform 2020 / Python 3 . | A big part of the day to day work in our facilities | . | . | Documentation [0:10-0:20] . | Mission statements (Daniel) . | Example | No response to mailing list email: how to interpret this? | Larry: had discussion in OpenEXR TSC, what’s the boundary between “mission statement” and “succinct description of project”. How do we tell people “what do we want to do?” | Daniel: every project has a description of what they are, some have “what we are not”, and that’s valuable as well. Goes partway towards informing what is a mission statement. There are different versions of these. Should we formalize this more, agree on language and terminology. | JF: how similar should ASWF projects be | Emily: have requested that projects have a link to ASWF, but there is benefit to having projects retain their own identity. | Daniel: there’s value in some standardization: ease of discovery, find information in consistent ways, quick start to get projects going, best practices. Infrastructure and tooling also sees value in standardization. This conversation has happened in various projects. There are many opportunities to add value, but we don’t want to be too prescriptive. | Michael Min: sat in on OCIO project TSC, questions of identifying personal vs institutional contributions. | Daniel: this would relate to governance documentation. Michael: discussion mentioned template projects to specify some mechanisms. | Daniel: need to ask questions of the board as to what they are actually looking for in terms of mission statements from projects. | Emily: sometimes the language is there but it is buried, so maybe just need more clarity / explicitness. | . | TSC FAQs (John) . | PR | Josh: OpenTimelineIO has found this information useful when setting up a new project. | . | Project success metrics (John) . | PR | . | Template Project (JF) . | Sample Project Repo . | Making progress on this, may need to reorganize structure to make it either an “information repository” or an “actionable template” project. | . | Sample Windows Container Repo . | Container builds are quite slow by default (takes a long time to pull container images from Docker Hub) | Could investigate storing container images on GitHub and/or Azure instead | . | CDash test dashboard . | Should all ASWF projects that use CTest aggregate test results on CDash? | . | . | . | Security [0:20-0:30] . | OpenEXR update (Cary, Kimball) . | Secure Development Lifecycle (Dave) . | Project reached out to Dave Hutchison at Foundry who joined las TSC call. | Gave thorough responses / indications on practical steps to approach security requirements for our industry. | Discussed how Foundry engaged with Google Fuzz group, support load.

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 [0:00-0:05] . | Governing Board update . | David Morin shared rough goals for the Foundation, will be shared soon. Along similar lines as first year: expand membership base, financial stability, Premier Members committed to 2 year tenure, need to make sure ASWF delivers good value. | TAC goals: appetite for expanding project base, TAC is expected to contribute to this process. | . | Survey process (Gordon) . | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYs8RABGS7qFJHvICzj5Jln83MRAZ855WC0qMWq8Vqw/edit . | Last call for input from TAC: end of week to finalize input. At which point send to Governing Board for their additions, then send out to membership. | Any feedback is welcome, but need to make sure we gather actionable data. | Form version from John Mertic: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5MBSTs4SZBABSMQiTu-G_WSnACKGpxVOhPXZgXQUNGnjCSg/formrestricted but not currently accessible . | Daniel: would seem “strange” to not have a list of proposed projects. Larry: if we ask anything about projects they would want “in”, it’s not useful unless they also specify “why” the project should be part of ASWF. Gordon: nice benefit of projects is that their name is unambiguous. So open question is better than a list, doesn’t imply endorsement or arm twisting. Henry: advantage of an actual list is that you can identify trends over time. Likes Larry’s suggestion that there should be a justification as to why someone would want to see a project join ASWF. Eric: isn’t the pitch for ASWF that we make projects more stable / reliable / longer term viable? Cary: agrees with Larry, there must be a realizable benefit to taking the project out of its current state and putting it into ASWF. John: related to this it would be a good idea to communicate how ASWF membership has improved the projects that have joined. | Kimball: also ties in to dependency management, and how many of our dependencies live within the ASWF. | Michael: is there any movement towards publishing the intent and results of the survey. Should have a statement of what will be done with the data, will it be posted publicly? Gordon: will we get less candid feedback if the survey results are posted? Daniel: it should be important to state how the results will be posted. Had discussion with Emily, could be good basis for annual report. | Gordon: added placeholder for the survey intent, and for open list of projects. | . | . | Goals for TAC to end 2019 [0:05-0:15] . | Almost at November, so we have only a few weeks before end of 2019. | Project graduations . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion (wave) . | Wave has been reaching out to a number of organizations, Daniel has been setting up calls . | No specific info to report back for now . | Looking for organizations to partner with, looking for specific information that could be applied to improving our own processes . | A lot of interest in this aspect in the Outreach Committee and Governing Board . | . | Documentation . | Mission statements TAC list . | Proposal from OpenEXR with discussion . | Cary: was present at board meeting where Rob put out this request. | Discussed at TSC, draft by Rob Bogard and Cary, sent draft to Rob Bredow. He gave feedback that it might concentrate more on current state, feedback was incorporated. | What is the real purpose behind the projects, what is the scope (“guardrails”). | Tried to add to the home page, but hard to discuss in isolation of the rest of the information. At the top of the page there will be a description of what the project does, mission statement could be right below that. | Cary: not completely satisfied with the end result, OpenEXR web site itself is up for a major refresh. | Asking for thoughts about how this information should be presented on project page . | Eric: would consider putting the Mission Statement as a separate page linked to by the main menu. Guides what you do and don’t do, different purpose of what you would put on the home page. Cary: also considered putting on a separate page, but feels that Rob thinks that this should be information that is “hard to miss”, and moving that to a separate page might not achieve this goal. | Cary: ideally a Mission Statement should be one or two sentences, but what OpenEXR currently has is a lot more verbose than that. So probably need to go back and try to prune it down. | Daniel: “should be tweetable”, also if we stick to the constraint of a short mission statement it makes it easier to put it in different places. | Cary: 1-2 sentence mission statement summary could link to more detailed page. | Larry: the two paragraphs proposed are a great summary of what the project is about, and do belong at the “top of the page”. Everybody’s README.md should start off with a 1-2 paragraph of what the project is about. Boiling down to the ‘140 character’ version could be a separate task. | Cary: write the mission statement, be thorough and comprehensive, but make sure that if you only read the beginning you still get the gist of it, and you can lift the first 1-2 sentences to provide a summary. | Michael: that can be what you add to other ASWF literature that points to the project. | . | Template project (JF) . | Should the more detailed info go into the Wiki section? . | John: could work on a better organization, offering to help . | . | TAC Project . | Some outstanding PRs that have gone “quiet” . | Create Graduation checklist for projects to use . | Charter Typos . | Create an FAQ for a TSC . | Create Project Success metrics . | Commit numbers? . | Diversity of contributions? . | Frequency / quality of releases? . | Project usage? . | . | Daniel: are we looking for feedback from TAC? . | Should we have a “mission statement” for the tac repo? Who owns it, who is responsible for it? . | John: typically on other foundations those repos are owned by multiple members of the TAC. | John: PRs against the tac repo could generate emails to the tac mailing list? Daniel: this is the first time that PRs have gone idle, so we may not really need more process. For now we can use GitHub mechanisms for drawing attention to PRs. | . | . | VFXPlatform 2020 . | Python 3 | . | CI Progress . | . | Vote: Renew annual term of VES Technical Committee Industry Representative, JF Panisset . | One of 3 Industry Representatives on the TAC . | Informal approval from VES Tech Committee . | Daniel moves to renew JF Panisset as Industry Representative . | Seconded by Kimball . | All ayes, no against, no abstain . | Unanimous renewal . | . | Technical Project updates [0:15-0:30] . | OpenTimelineIO . | Apache license discussion ongoing. | No update from last meeting | . | Some meetings with Avid coming soon. | Meeting with 2 separate Avid people next week, and later discussion in November. | Approval to share some of the technical documentation they provided . | . | Working with TSC on proposed schema improvements. | . | OpenVDB . | OpenCue . | Dave Fellows: no specific updates from 2 weeks ago. Some security-related items have been noted requiring attention. | . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: working on Python 3, discussion on GPU CI infrastructure, should have more updates soon. | Waiting for Andy to work with Sean to work out arrangement with AWS, and LF RelEng. | Wave doing investigation at Apple as to how we could do CI on GPU-enabled Mac platform. | Andy: recovering (email!) from leave, will be available to start working on these tasks starting tomorrow. | . | OpenEXR . | Security feedback . | Had call with Dan Hutchison from Foundry, would be a good idea to invite him to other / wider forums. | He seemed to agree that the steps taken in OpenEXR are the right way to go. Requirements around reporting and updating public information on reported security vulnerabilities. You post a fix, then make sure the CVE report adds the link back to the fix. | Kimball: make sure you have two factor auth on your GitHub account . | Daniel: we should try to capture this in a way that other projects can use (start with email). | . | Cary: adoption proposal, outlines stats about project activity, CII badge process . | License scan approved by board yesterday, so should be ready for graduation. | Finally set up with EasyCLA system, ready to move repo to ASWF GitHub organization. It seems to be a bit backward to move the project into the GitHub organization before full acceptance? . | Larry had posted message about getting into cadence of patch releases, so discussion of branching strategy to support that. | Constant thorn in their side is Boost / Boost-Python, so looking at replacing Boost-Python with PyBind11 Not a simple project at all. | Getting steady stream of build issue reports, especially on Windows. Doing a reasonable job of keeping up with those reports. | Should be more pro-active to reaching out to distro maintainers, pushing to update to more recent versions. Some distros still include version 1.7, important to update given security-related fixes. | VFX Reference Platform looking at moving to 2.4.0 for Reference Platform 2020. | Going with 2.4.0 instead of 2.3.1 is due to the additional of an API function. | . | . | CI updates [0:30-0:40] . | Access / Roles / Workflow for updates . | Some frustration from projects . | Possibly best handled in an email discussion . | . | Azure best practices . | GPU agents . | . | Update on candidate projects [0:40-0:50] . | Media player | . | Next meeting . | 6 November 2019 | . | .

Kimball: OpenEXR can compile against both Python 2 and 3.. | Kimball: we should extract the CMake bits into a centralized place to make this easier to share / reuse, demonstrate how best to compile for both approaches . | Daniel: asking Kimball to look at how to abstract this. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Wave not present at this meeting, but more work has been happening since last meeting meeting.. | Emily: spreadsheet outstanding, will be sent after call . | . | Survey process . | Gordon / Kimball: revived survey thread. Gordon: went through comments on proposed document, bigger question is inherent tension between getting clear info on projects people want to see vs not wanting to appear “predatory”. General consensus: instead of listing projects explicitly, allow more free form identification of areas / projects, but include justification information. | Any last comments, or do we feel that we are in position to present to Governing Board. | Kimball: should we ask about other types of projects, should we just “stick to C++ libraries” or branch out? Gordon: at early meetings there was discussions on whether we should be looking at media / datasets as well as code. Daniel: anticipate that this will come up in feedback, our response so far has been somewhat inconclusive on this topic. Perhaps we should have a clear answer as to what we see the scope of ASWF. Gordon: we’ve mostly avoided answering that question so far. Daniel: we need to be clear as to what we’re going to do with the data from the survey. Kimball: should we be trying to foster projects such as improving the “social” aspect of the industry (“sharing Nuke scripts” for instance, Python snippets…). Gordon: an “eclectic set of ideas”. There is a section asking “what do you want to see the ASWF focus on next year”? Maybe we could have a set of suggestions. John: might as well keep doing this in the Word document, and will get translated to survey form. | Daniel: last call for last minute comments! . | . | . | Thread Pools / Tbb (Larry) [0:10-0:25] . | TAC-list thread . | Larry: there was an offlist discussion started by SideFX folks, interactions between thread pools in Houdini, OpenIMageIO, OpenVDB… . | Specific problem on Windows: on app shutdown it terminates the threads before calling static destructors, leading to deadlocks in threadpools, is there a way to cleanly shutdown every threadpool. | For each of these libraries / apps, they design their thread strategies in isolation, assuming they are the only thread pool in the process address space. This is no longer the case, if you have 8 libraries that each try to use all 16 cores on a system, you now have 128 threads… . | ASWF TAC can provide a forum to “corral the chaos”, what are best practices. | For many of the apps, they have already settled on TBB, so non-TBB apps / libraries need to be at least aware of this. | OpenEXR has an ability to override use of its own thread pool and allow the app to provide thread pool control. | Even if all we ended up with was basic guidance on how apps / libraries should set up thread pools. In some cases just using TBB might be the best approach, or the app could provide its own interface to TBB. | Daniel: extensive feedback on mailing list shows there’s an appetite for this. | Daniel: at what level should an abstraction live in order to be safe and effective. It’s trivial to have a naive thread pool, but specific behavior of specific thread pools can be useful / important. A naive abstraction may be under specified. | Larry: agreed. There is a safety and quality issue. Easy to write a thread pool infrastructure with subtle problems. Useful to discourage people from writing their own. | Sean: looking into getting a threading expert from TBB group, but wasn’t able to do this on short notice. | Sean / Dan: in theory different versions of TBB should be interoperable, but in practice if you mix different TBB versions, that can lead to crashes. | Larry: in theory everyone should stick to TBB version from Reference Platform. | Gordon: TBB offered promise of forward / backward compatibility. Would be great to get the current perspective from Intel expert / TBB team, is this something we can rely on, or should we not assume this is the case. | Daniel: asking Kimball if they had issues with forward or backward compatibility? Kimball: was compiling against newer version, Katana was loading earlier version, was getting crashes deep in thread affinity code. | Patrick: another perspective, let the host (DCC) manage the threads so the library only guaranteed to be thread safe. “Apply” in OpenColorIO, host can call this method in different threads, library guarantees that this work. Let the one having all the knowledge (the DCC) manage the threads. | Gordon: that helps for a simple library, the challenge is when you have a complex library (threaded USD composition for instance) it gets problematic. | Chris reporting better performance from threading outside of TBB. | Larry: would be interested in investigating this. So far has only heard this report once. | Gordon: for a embarassingly parallel problem you might always be able to come up with an application-specific threading model which is slightly more efficient. | Kimball: trying to move towards a fully stateless model where OpenEXR wouldn’t do threading. | Daniel: also different considerations for I/O parallelism . | Kimball: will keep utility functionality to provide a default threading implementation for naive callers . | Dan: from the VDB perspective, they use TBB heavily, preferred solution, if you are building the TBB plugin, you are using the TBB version used by that version of Houdini. Seems like a reliable way to use TBB. Hard to see how you could create an abstraction layer on top of TBB since OpenVDB uses so much of TBB. But one area which is interesting is that it would be interesting to be able to compile OpenVDB against fewer dependencies, and TBB is currently a required dependency. Would it be possible to compile VDB against a simpler subset? If we were to create an ASWF library on top of TBB, that would not just really be solving any problems. | Daniel: embree has internal thread implementation which you can use instead of TBB. | Sean: set up as a compile flag. | Daniel: non trivial task of capturing all the points of view, also deeper discussion with Intel. Should this be done as a sub group. Larry: is it worth setting up a separate list to discuss this? Probably not worth separate meetings. For instance OpenEXR, OpenImageIO and SideFX already have a conversation going. Gordon: this is a “task force” model, Autodesk would be interested in joining this discussion since they consume a lot of these APIs. | Dan: would be good to try using TBB for OpenEXR / OpenImageIO, happy to contribute expertise. Larry: at few years ago took a look at TBB for OpenImageIO, seemed like a large dependency, and dual licensing seemed complicated. Also came from a single vendor (Intel), would it only work on certain CPUs / OSes. So “rolled his own”, but has nothing against TBB, license has been cleared up, it’s a real open source project, and OpenImageIO is already indirectly dependant on TBB since it is dependant on OpenVDB. So has no issue with using TBB. | Daniel: good area for TAC to work on. | Gordon: Autodesk has threading experts, can they join the discussion? Yes, TAC list is open. Larry: bring anyone else who is interested as well. | . | Graduation guidelines — committers vs contributors (Brian) . | https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/102#discussion_r338553385 . | Current graduation guidelines only mentions “committers”, should we clarify what is meant by committers / contributors. | Daniel: having a “diverse range of committers” is a stricter requirement than “a diverse range of contributors”. | What does “a healthy number” really mean? Is the vagueness intentional? . | Larry: committers just means “the people who have the permission to hit the merge button” in GitHub. Depending on project policy, having many people allowed to merge is not necessarily better (although need to adhere to the “bus rule”, can’t just be one). | Dave: number of organizations contributing is also an important metric. | John: concern you are trying to prevent is having a project controlled by a single organization, where if the organization walks away the project collapses. | Commiter tends to be someone more deeply involved in the project. If you have 10 committers across 5 organizations, 2 organizations can walk away and the project still survives. What about committers vs TSC? . | Daniel: will suggest a “path to solution” with an update to the PR: say “each of those things is important”. | Brian: template charter says “TSC can supercede committers”, but maybe there should be explicit language defining how to decide who gets to be committer. | Andrew: TSC is final arbiter of committers on most projects. But a particular project wants to propose a committer, that proposal is usually made by a current committer, discussion in the open between current committers, then proposal brought to TSC. In OpenDaylight community in 6 years the TSC denied committer rights only 3 times, was usually based on the proposed committer having never actually contributed code. Overall policy is defined by the TSC. The TAC can give guidance, but the TSC for a particular project has that right / responsibility. | Brian: immediate concern is clarifying graduation process. Happy to take a stab at updating John’s PR or the original graduation requirements document. Daniel: can have further discussion on GitHub, will discuss at next TAC meeting. | . | Technical Project updates [0:30-0:45] . | OpenVDB . | Dan: Approaching new 7.0 major version, by end of month, part of VFX Platform 2020. Bump compiler to C++14. Still discussing minimum CMake version, any consensus from other projects? Larry: what versions are being debated? Dan: minimum is 3.8, looking to move to 3.11 or 3.12. Larry: bumped OSL / OpenImageIO to 3.12. Dan: tried to maintain compatibility for a few years in the past. Kimball: Ubuntu 18 is still at 3.10, but 3.12 has some really nice features. Patrick: OpenColorIO recently moved from 3.10 to 3.11 due to a Windows specific issue. | Daniel: a good issue to discuss. Good discussion to have on the list. | . | OpenColorIO . | GPU . | Doug: V2 is progressing well, Patrick just upgraded to latest YAML version, OCIO had been stuck on old version of YAML library. On CI front we’ve had CI process go down a couple of times due to changes in Azure macOS build agent. Any way to get notified of those changes in advance. Was able to address within a week, but long term would like more control over the agents. | Have been working with Andy for GPU support, no current support for dynamic agents, an issue but not a blocker. Andy: we can stand up GPU instances, they would be static instances (running full time). Had heard from Microsoft about plans to roll out dynamic build instances, but haven’t heard anything about progress for a while. Same for discussions for GitHub Actions, that functionality not available until next year. We could move forward with static build instances, instances are computing resources / money full time. Does ASWF want to spend money on what could potentially be idle instances. | . | OpenEXR . | Graduation | . | OpenCue . | OpenTimelineIO . | Avid involvement | . | . | CI updates . | Working group . | OpenVDB artifacts in Nexus repo: still needed? . | Is there a problem with maintaining Nexus repo after standing down Jenkins infrastructure. | Andy: if we’re not going to keep updating artifacts we should move them somewhere else. | Artifactory Cloud is available for free for open source service. | Was an available location for large binary distributions. | Andy: for relatively static objects could be done as AWS S3 buckets . | Dan: would be happy to move this to another location. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Media Player | . | Next meeting . | 20 November 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2019 . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion (Wave, Emily) . | Look within your organization to see if there’s someone that doesn’t look like you that could be your replacement or tag team member on the TAC. If that person is unavailable, ask them for referrals/suggestions. | Please take a look at this google doc and see if you have any personal contacts there (look at the board of advisors or leaders, also consider members). If so, please reach out individually and see if they have any suggestions/connections for us. Could be opportunities to present what ASWF is, what kinds of contributions folks could do (familiarize with our projects, pull requests, associate membership, etc.) . | https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XxH3hIsk1K3GDAZymF8emh8AWF3T_1bLf32_EXKSiE0/edit#gid=1665706912 | . | . | VFXPlatform 2020 / Python 3 . | GPU support in CI (OCIO) . | Proof of concept commitment | . | Developer Engagement (Emily) - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MMUNxJl6sbpMQmIDAfjZ52lUP08mA16JY6AZwYFtGdM/edit?usp=sharing . | Putting together 2020 goals, increasing developer engagement and participation, cannot be developed in a silo. Should be led by the TAC, so need to present the slides so we can decide on priorities. | Seminars, meetups, developer days (hosted day of sessions, deep dives into projects, in cities with sizable developer community), use cases and case studies, written tutorials and technical blog posts . | Wave: all looks good, for the ones that are presentations, would be good to have a consistent “one slide” on how to contribute to ASWF projects. Agreed upon messaging. Emily: good idea, have existing “how to contribute” at high level, but need more developer focussed. Wave: may have a mix of technical artists and developers, target towards skills of people who show up (C++, Python, …). Different opportunities for people to engage. Daniel: past discussions have highlighted opportunities for a broad engagement, as well as encouraging skilled developers who are already using our projects to contribute directly to our projects. | Daniel: asking projects where our focus should be, “best bang for the buck” to get best return on effort. | Wave: similar to “every project should have mission statement”, every project should also have a “how to engage with our project” explicit statement / document. Sean: do we want to make a distinction between internal developers in organizations who may not be able to commit to public repos vs external developers who have no such constraints? Wave: if you have code you have written that is locked up in our organization, having a “how to contribute” document helps to evangelize contributing back. Sean: should try to help non member organizations to contribute back. Larry: if people are having that issue in that organization, “bottom up” approach is unlikely to work. Top down may have better results, apply pressure at the executive level. More appropriate to the governing board. | Executive-level testimonials from existing organizations may be more convincing to outside organizations. | Larry: rather than outreach, “inreach” may be better, low hanging fruit are people already in organizations participating in projects / member organizations. Wave: simple, specific talking points to share within organization are helpful. Especially in large companies many potential contributors don’t know about ASWF, even when their company is a member. | Cary: generic, non-domain specific expertise can be quite useful. CMake for instance is not OpenEXR specific, but uses up a lot of time from OpenEXR contributors. Similarly for website, documentation. Not clear where to go for that expertise / contribution. Need more than just a “casual dalliance”, need specific commitment. | Emily: other LF projects have hired someone specifically to do documentation. Should raise this with governing board to hire contractor. | Daniel: expertise in non domain specific expertise could be found within our member companies. Wave: reaching out to a DevOps company as an associated member company could be interested. Emily: we could create a working group for some of those topics, provides a path for people to get involved in those activities. | Emily: providing a toolkit / format to internally advance and inform within their own organization. Is this something to do in person (“brown bag lunch sessions”?). Larry: people on the governing board, TAC, TSCs are senior in their organizations, as a group we need to go back to our organizations, identify junior developers and get them involved. | Daniel: hopefully that provides some points to work with. | Emily: priority should be to provide tools for internal evangelism, and provide talking points to demonstrate value of project involvement. | . | . | ASWF Annual Report (Emily) . | Project chairs - please take a look at the stats we would like to include for each project. | Stats due by Nov. 29 if possible. | Report outline: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yHB0AggIHwD6P-fhyQh9B5dJ_9QwiuBpP0ESQiVcpA4/edit?usp=sharing” . | Look back at year so far, use CNCF as a template. | Want to show impact of each project, number of contributors, key contributing companies, number of software releases. Will incorporate into infographics. | Will also include mission statements. | . | Follow ups . | ASWF Org and Project permissions and workflows (Andy) . | Responses sent as a private email thread . | Should move thread to public list . | Done: Thread | . | How we can deal with permissions and workflows across GitHub, DockerHub, Azure, SonarCloud… . | How do we grant rights, who gets what kind of administrator rights, at what level . | Andy: LF releng can hand over some administrative duties to some projects, but leery of doing it, historically have had issues with shared administration. Not to say LF releng won’t do it, as long as there is clear guidance on who has access to administrative rights, and what they are allowed to do. | How do projects get contributors up to have committer rights (approve PRs): . | LF releng has developed automated method for adding / removing contributors, top level info.yml file in repo controls it. That change requires quorum of current contributors, once it is merged it gets shadowed into a releng repo, gets reviewed, then automatically updates the GitHub repo positions. | Or GitHub has a MAINTAINERS file, no quorum based voting, easier to get someone in a committer status, only current mechanism is gatekeeper for adding to the MAINTAINERS. | . | Discussion about how projects go about “protecting” merges. Andy: Recommendation to have “hard” rather than “soft” rules, easier to avoid bypassing rules, easier for maintainer to push back on bending the rules. | If a project wants to go with “soft” rules, LF releng won’t object, but that is not the recommendation. | On the Azure Pipelines side, have been experimenting with permissions, since billing goes through LF, permissions go through Azure Active Directory. So can invite people into the LF organization without having to have them be actual members of the organization, and grant them specific rights to do what they need to do. Permission model in Azure Pipelines/DevOps is extensive (huge!), so may require some experimentation. | Daniel: LF releng has experience across many projects / foundations, should find the model that has worked elsewhere and fits our requirements best. | . | Survey for 2020 Goals (Emily, Gordon) . | Draft: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5MBSTs4SZBABSMQiTu-G_WSnACKGpxVOhPXZgXQUNGnjCSg/viewform . | Initially targeting board members, but feel it’s important for TAC and TSC members to also respond. | Based on feedback from TAC members, turned into a Google form. | Please provide feedback, don’t necessarily want to add too much . | Would like to get this out ahead of next week’s board meeting . | Daniel: thank you to Gordon for pushing this initiative forward. | . | Thread library (Larry) . | Good example of cross project leveraging, what the ASWF can provide as a forum to enable conversations around industry needs. | Daniel: 3 good examples: dependency management / CMake, thread library, OpenEXR math library . | Larry: should be sending summary, plan is to keep the conversation going. Won’t be a “one size fits all” solution, but will try to “tame the chaos”. | Daniel: was at SIGGRAPH Asia with people from USD and SideFX team, one of the main topics was abstraction used by USD / SideFX to address threading. Larry: any collateral available? Daniel: they promised that slides should be shared, will follow up. | Sean: reached out to TBB architect, he’s signing up to TAC mailing list, will respond there (Alexei Kukanov). | . | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | OpenColorIO . | OpenEXR . | Repo naming conventions / requirements (lowercase only?) . | Cary: upper case vs lower case? Hoping to move OpenEXR repo into ASWF GitHub organization this afternoon, we had a preference for CamelCase, but hot a strong performance. | Is that restriction a sensible thing that makes sense going forward? Is this a time to clean up this legacy? . | Andy: LF releng position is that CamelCase repo names causes problems with their tooling when cloning repos. | Larry: problem isn’t necessarily with the LF tooling, but Windows / Mac that has case preserving but not case sensitive filesystems (mostly on Windows, for repos that started on Linux). | Andy: creates a support burden when onboarding projects. Not to say LF releng won’t support CamelCase named projects. | Daniel: would it make sense to recognize that our projects already predominantly use CamelCase repo names, that if we decide to go to lowercase repo names we should do that across all our projects at the same time. So go with CamelCase with OpenEXR for now, but we can look at implications of moving all projects to lowercase going forward. | Andy: LF releng has run into issue where issues with specific repos generated a lot of support requests. | Cary: given broad use of OpenEXR, have steady stream of build related issues, testament to how widely it is used. So would like to remove that as an issue and go with lowercase. | Cary: it’s never been an issue because current repo name is lowercase. | Cary: this doesn’t apply to organization name? Andy: correct, since that doesn’t end up in your path. | What about multiple related repos, “openexr”, “images”, “viewers”. Those will all exist as a flat repo hierarchy under AcademySoftwareFoundation. Larry: OpenColorIO will be like that as well. Cary: each repo needs infrastructure (license file, README, …). Some minimal amount of infrastructure that points back to the main repo. | . | OpenCue . | Update on OpenCue meetup last week at Sony Imageworks, was in context of LA pipeline developers Meetup group. | 2 people from Imageworks, 2 people from OpenCue. | Around 30-40 people attended, small enough to make it interactive, technical enough to be able to go in depth. | Recorded, should be publishing soon. | Will try to do more in the future, was quite successful. | LA Pipeline meetup would be open to other topic suggestions for future meetings. | Sean: is there value in having a suite of presentations “cued up” for our projects, for other events, conferences. Emily: yes, having a “Meetup” toolkit would be useful, have a “standard deck” per project. Relies on each project to put together such a deck. Daniel: there is such a deck for the ASWF and the TAC (presented most recently at SIGGRAPH Asia). Emily will send link. But should have more specific TSC-level decks for each project. Sean: we should take advantage of the high profile of some of our contributors to draw interest into our projects. | . | OpenTimelineIO . | Having regular tech-focused calls with Avid (informal working group) . | Designated contact for AAF technical details, unlocked some blockers about that technology, had 8 people on call this morning. | . | Legal conversation around modified Apache is making some progress . | Email thread, currently using modified Apache, Disney wants to keep that modification, project would like to move to unmodified. | Legal folks are finding a compromise that will hopefully get this unblocked. | . | Beginning to talk with TSC about mission statement for OTIO . | . | . | CI updates . | Working group | . | Update on candidate projects . | Media Player? | . | Next meeting . | 4 December 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2019 . | GPU enabled CI Proof of concept | VFX Platform 2020 / Python 3 | . | Follow ups . | Threading library / best practices . | Larry: tricky situation, needs of the projects are varied, OpenEXR on one of the scale where they use internal / home grown thread library, make things easy for applications by adding a public API call that lets calling application provide its own threading library. Other end is OpenVDB that uses Intel TBB so deeply that it would be very difficult to replace it. So seems unlikely to find a solution that would span the range of needs. Some people in isolation express misgivings on using TBB as the solution, but we don’t want to encourage home grown solutions, and encouraging TBB is probably currently the best approach. Maybe we can get some help from Intel to help deal with expressed issues, also room for establishing best practices, for instance how do we deal with an ecosystem of libraries that all want to use multithreading independently of each other. | Gordon: can you elaborate about concerns about TBB? Larry: don’t know that there are real issues, “median” opinion is that TBB is a pretty good solution, we should track down the “outliers” who have concerns. Could also be based on experience from years ago. | Kimball: may have been the one claiming an issue, experience is mostly about mixing versions of TBB, for instance a plugin compiled with a different version of TBB than the main application. Seems to mostly work, but can end up with random crashes at exit. | Sean: have had issues with initialization of MPP, proprietary schedulers and usage of task arenas, when you have multiple libraries who might try to initialize TBB in different orders. But overall think it’s a good idea to encourage use of TBB, with some best practices. | Larry: unless you have a good reason not to, should encourage using TBB. OpenVDB won’t have needs satisfied unless entirety of TBB. | Sean: USD may bring similar needs. | Daniel: Pixar have a wrapper around TBB, but it’s “leaky” (libwork in USD), served the purpose of providing an easy place to consistently restricting the number of threads. That’s apparently less of an issue in current TBB versions. Concerns about mixing multiple clients (maximum consistency) vs being able to control the threading system. | Daniel: can we draw any useful / simplified conclusion? Sounds like a direct opportunity to articulate challenges that people meet, and make it easy for people to use TBB in multiple libraries. Maybe adding some kind of standard layer / shim library, and/or provide feedback to Intel to make things easier. Sean has already suggest that TBB team is eager to get our feedback. | Sean: forwarded Larry email to TBB architect, team is in Russia, they are interested in engaging with us. | . | GPU CI . | Work on costing (JF) -&gt; cannot use K80 instances for OpenGL, need GRID license | Need to look at preemptible instances | Larry: although today’s development of OCIO is primarily interested in testing against OpenGL, going forward is probably going to run CUDA code paths. | Sean: scalability might be an issue, as we expand GPU need into other projects. Also do we want to expose this testing pool to forks of our projects. How widely do we want to make this mechanism available to our developers. | Larry: expanding to expand to PRs seems like a core requirement. | Michael: it’s not like there are dozens of PRs coming in. | John: is concern mostly about cost? Sean: could be premature optimization. John: there are different ways to handle cost issues. | JF: Could also use Software OpenGL in some cases (example of DJV): Michael: OCIO test suite known to fail on software OpenGL implementation. | Eric: are projects interested in a range of GPUs or drivers? Testing on multiple / simultaneous GPUs? | Michael: platform differences can be crucial | Daniel: do we have enough info to generate formal resource request to board or one of our members? One machine is a tractable amount of money, 10 machines would be a lot more. Do we have enough of a concrete use case to “turn things on” now? OCIO project: how urgently do you want this? | Michael: targeting OCIO v2 for next summer, so would be useful to get it going. Doug: don’t get GPU-related PRs every day, a few minor changes every other week. But would like to put in place for the project. | Daniel: will follow up with Dave about support for dynamic instances on Azure. JF: will pick up discussion thread with Azure Pipelines team. | Sean: not so concerned about cost optimization, willing to cover the cost, but dynamic instances could be interesting for scalability concerns (especially if builds start to queue up). | Wave: has been investigating availability of macOS build resources. Shipping of new MacPro later this month may help. JF: will be looking at Orka on MacStadium. | Wave: on Mac Mini hardware, only Intel integrated graphics is available. The restrictions about the number of instances of macOS you can run is a business rather than a technical issue. | . | Surveys . | Daniel: member survey is making the rounds, Emily sent reminder. Emily: trying to finalize the survey, will share results soon. | . | . | Python 3 . | Working group to share studio expertise? | Provide good examples of how to transition different types of code bases | Binding generation (pybind11) | OpenEXR is in process of tackling this issue, Kimball working on CMake changes to allow Python 2.7 and Python 3 to both be built alongside. | Other projects in good shape, but want updates from individual projects. | OpenTimelineIO: differences between Python 2.7 and 3 haven’t been much of an issue, except for some small Unicode issues. More issues about packaging and package management, so could use some help from the wider community. | OCIO: not there yet, in the process of writing new bindings with pybind11 which will give dual version support, 30% of the way done, should be done in a couple of months. | Cary: Python bindings for imath, already building for 2.7 and 3, plan to rewrite bindings with pybind11. | Gordon: Is there a general model that we should suggest how to do this? Struggling for a good model for Maya. Goal is to get a beta out, but depend on a number of libraries, if all the libraries choose “can only build one at a time” vs “can build in parallel” has an effect. | Kimball: assuming that for OpenEXR need to assuming that both versions need to be supported for a while to ensure transition. But OpenEXR is pretty simple. Kimball: can build in same build, but will generate separate DSOs. | Kimball: need more work your CMake files to support building and packaging 2.7 and 3 in the same build, but fairly transparent where stuff ends. | Josh: also using CMake / pybind11, but overall developer instructions have flaws, also issues when pushing to PyPI. Would really like to know “how to reach out to”. | Daniel: should we create a working group on the Python 3 topic? Would Josh like to lead this? Josh: yes, but would have to start next year. Daniel: deep in this process at Animal Logic, keen to share knowledge and learn from others. | Daniel: we should try to collect and gather efforts and resources. | Larry: Gordon, don’t hesitate to communicate with packages that Maya is waiting for movement on Python 3. Gordon: will get the Maya Python 3 lead to join the group. Larry: some library owners may not realize that their library is in the dependency tree of Maya. | Daniel: when you analyze upstream dependencies, sometimes it’s not clear there is a Python 3 equivalent of a library. | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB | OpenColorIO . | Already discussed GPU / Python 3 | Trying to start up more formal discussion with ACES, trying to clear up licensing on ACES-related code (aces-ocio config is used by many studios) | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: repo was moved to ASWF GitHub organization 3 weeks ago, locked out of submitting PRs due to EasyCLA system. Was reporting that Cary’s company didn’t have a CLA on file, problem was just identified (LucasFilm vs ILM), so problem resolved now. Something to watch out for, need to watch out with dependent company names. | Daniel: had similar issues with some other transitions. What can we do to make things more obvious. | Cary: the ASWF can help with this, should be a more familiar issue if it comes up again. | JF: EasyCLA system works well but is a bit intimidating. John: has heard similar feedback from other contributors. | Larry: important that “CLA Manager” be clearly designated, and close to the project. | . | OpenCue . | Focussed on finishing up Python 3 work, should be done mid next week, every component but 1 has been migrated. Futurize tool did 90% of the work. Not so much in terms of packaging issues though. | . | OpenTimelineIO . | No specific updates | . | . | CI updates . | Working group | . | Update on candidate projects . | Media player | . | Dev Analytics preview ( https://lfanalytics.io/projects/academy-software-foundation ) . | John: goal is to showcase some of the analytics around or projects, more than the basic ones provided by GitHub. Answer higher level questions. Early stages of how do we pull this together. Currently pulling GitHub and Slack. Company Contributor stats currently wrong, being worked on. | Commit growth, number of commits, can break down based on contributors and organizations. Over time will be able to pull in communications info (Slack, mailing lists). | Caveat: “in beta” really should be “in alpha”, asking for feedback. Also “what are the bigger picture questions you want to answer about your project”. | JF: should this be extended to other systems in the ASWF landscape? Or at least some important ones? | Josh: could be interesting to look at stats across projects (are projects siloed vs contributing to multiple projects). John: would be useful to have insight across projects. | Brian: is this pulling in multiple repos for individual projects? John: yes, multiple Slack channels as well. | Feedback via TAC list is good. | . | Next meeting . | December 18 2019? | . | . ",

Heard today about requirements for a successful Working Group. | John: happy to help with setting up structure of goal, timeline, deliverables. Can come up with a candidate proposal. | Daniel: is there anyone willing to volunteer to lead this process? | Gordon: may be easier to find a leader once we’ve defined the goals. | Daniel: does anyone have experience to share across our projects? Some interesting questions raised on TAC list, specifically transition to pybind11. | Will there be cross pollination with the VFX Reference Platform group? Daniel: yes. | JF is liaison with VFX Technology Committee. | Wave: is there a notion of the deliverable of this group? Is it guidelines, code, best practices? Daniel: that sounds like the agenda of a first meeting. | . | Documentation . | Daniel, Project visibility at a high level, but also a useful resource for active and incoming developers. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Useful discussions during earlier session, need to do work to summarize those results | . | Developer Engagement | Priority Discussion on Working Groups . | Gordon: we talked about a number of other Working Groups today, would be useful to come up with a more formal list, prioritize the work, where do we have the energy / resources / knowledge. | Wave: USD is not an “actionable topic”, need specific action items. Under the heading of “USD” need specific ideas. | Gordon: do we need to have these Working Group approved by the Governing Board? John: not needed, unless there’s budgetary approval required. The TAC has the authority to decide what it wants to work on. | We need to determine what constitutes a Working Group. Part of the issue with USD is that it belongs to Pixar, and may not have the desire to give up control (but OTIO is counter example). John: there may be an opportunity to have something similar to the Project Lifecycle Document for Working Groups (not as much depth). | Daniel: there may be 2 categories. One is a clear area of interest for the TAC, the other is more aspirational about reaching some of our long term goals. Cost is low for a Working Group, don’t want to take it too lightly, but want to take advantage of energy and enthusiasm. | Gordon: would it be interesting to set a goal for next meeting to have a list of possible Working Groups, create some proposals, and have a vote? It can be hard to come up with that list just in a meeting. | John: can work to produce a lightweight document for Working Group lifecycle. Typically an idea for a Working Group needs a champion behind it. | . | . | Google Summer of Code (Larry) [0:20-0:30] . | https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/master/gsoc/README.md | Larry: have taken on the work of the application process, describing our organization, pointers to our resources, submitted yesterday. | Saw PR feedback today (https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/119 – https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/tree/master/gsoc), landing page where students end up with a list of potential projects. Feb 5 is the deadline. | Bottom section of the page are placeholders for each of the member projects, would like to see 3-5 ideas per project for summer student projects. Need a mentor for each project. Also list any special skills required. | Larry: TSC chairs please submit PRs with ideas for their individual projects. | Feb 20 is when Google announces which projects are accepted into the program. | Previous experience is that this dramatically increases the exposure of a project. Students might propose their own ideas as well. | Left a slot to allow flexibility to suggest ASWF members or students to suggest cross-project idea, or an idea that falls outside our own projects, for instance integrating one of our projects into an external open source project. | . | CI updates [0:30-0:40] . | Working group . | Haven’t had working group meeting since last TAC meeting, so no specific new activities to report. | But good time to discuss what direction we might want to steer the CI working group | Model has been a long running group, but with periodic goal review. | We targeted GPU as an important requested feature, work by JF to build a prototype to build that support. | Still waiting on support to dynamically manage a pool of resources | Andrew: there has been pushback on static deployment of a GPU instance, so LF RelEng doesn’t currently manage static instances. Had call with GitHub Actions team today, roadmap for dynamic build capabilities at the end of this quarter. Not clear if that will also translate to Azure Pipelines. GitHub may be able to give access to larger instances than the default, with the caveat of perhaps longer latency for access to those instances. That may not be an issue for our types of projects. | Daniel: use case was OCIO, asking Michael what would be the requirements from OCIO? | Michael: can run tests locally, but the goal is to be able to do it “in the cloud”, it’s a critical piece of OCIO, especially with working happening on OCIO v2. Need help on the Azure side, as far as GitHub Actions it looks fairly similar to Azure Pipelines, so could potentially try that. | John: sounds like there are instances outside of Azure Pipelines? Andrew: Offer is credits from AWS, but billing can be complicated, primary issue is that it is a managed instance of a flavor that LF releng doesn’t currently support. | Daniel: sounds like we may need to take this issue offline (next wednesday CI meeting), so may need to forward with standing up instances dynamically. | Daniel: ideally CI environment should be a component of the Python 3 transition, some projects have managed to set up a dual Python 2 / 3 testing environment. OpenEXR went for approach where you can build Python 2 and 3 bindings, parallel availability of Python versions. | Larry: is that extra work something that we want to support / recommend? For OIIO it supports one or the other. | Gordon: sounds like a good question for the Python 3 Working Group! | Daniel: how do large DCC applications manage this? | . | . | Update on candidate projects [0:40-0:50] . | Gordon: ideas for projects to bring into ASWF, or work projects for ourselves? | Daniel: specific candidate projects as Rez. Some of what came from survey: . | Rez: Alan is still interested to move project towards adoption, has opened up contribution process, wider group of people involved in maintenance. Is a Working Group a good way to guide this project further? . | Larry: anyone concerned with Rez licensing? LGPL 3 (licensing migration topic was discussed). | LGPL may be just as difficult as GPL to push through a studio legal organization. | John: will follow up. | . | USD: top of the survey. | Gordon: the message is that we’re not trying to be predatory. We’re not trying to “acquire” external projects, in this case just help. | . | Media player (discussed in previous TAC meeting) . | DJV, some work to integrate with OTIO | Why is this an area of perceived need, especially if there isn’t a clear candidate | . | John: we had slowdown in submissions to the Landscape project, so if we spot any missing projects, please engage the maintainers to submit. Also trying to transfer the opensourcevfx.org domain to point to this. | . | . | Additional Topics . | We moved away from having predefined slots for our projects, but anyone is free to add topics from the projects. For example Cary asked about help on defining the scope of where OpenEXR should go (was somewhat of a rhetorical device to state the goals of the OpenEXR project). | Gordon: some amount of funding was applied to CI last year, but we should discuss if that’s what we want to do this year. A clear list of tasks for each projects (or across projects) helps to define our priorities and where funds could be applied. | Daniel: OCIO has been effective at defining a clear roadmap, good first issues, where resources are needed. Michael: we had discussed creating a web page to freely explore project needs. OCIO has created “First Issue” tags on GitHub (relevant for Google Summer of Code). But some of the issues are rather big. Tagging is good, but a landing page would be useful as well. | John: main page on TAC repo is to use a badging system, including a Good First Issue tag. https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/ | Michael: somewhere where projects can summarize bigger needs, digging through GitHub issues can be cumbersome. | John: standard tag scheme for projects might help. JF: needs to be documented in template project. | Daniel: reporting and accounting of engineering resources. | Cary: what about security? That was discussed a fair amount early on, OpenEXR feels they’ve gotten to a “good place”, but it seems the topic has fallen off the radar. Also Larey reminded splitting imath as a separate project from OpenEXR: still very much thinking about this, several components to this: . | Straightforward modernization of the code | Mechanics of moving code to a new repo without losing history | How do you motivate doing this kind of work when it’s “not your day job” | Would be good for projects to state that they would want to use imath separate from OpenEXR as a clear use case, specifying the deliverables. | Previous discussions have veered off into a number of discussions on the general topic of vector / matrix libraries. | Need to modernize implementation of Python bindings. Use of Boost Python is a thorn in our side, CMake does not play well with it. But waiting for someone to have the time and dive in. | . | John: on the security topic there was a failed attempt to get a security working group going, now that we are putting in place a slightly more formal structure for setting priorities we might make more progress. Initial impetus was reactionary, based on OpenEXR having outstanding CVEs. Should define what downstream consumers for our projects expect. Further define what our graduated projects should offer as security-related guarantees. | OpenVDB is struggling with similar issues, hard to define what is meant by “security issues”. Cary: what does a “vulnerability” mean (maliciously constructed images that cause buffer overflows). | Daniel: initial discussions were triggered by CII badge requirements, but didn’t explicitly record the feedback from Foundry engineer as to what is a reasonable security posture. | Andrew: what happens if a project “loses” its CII status? Can it be “ungraduated” / lose its badge? | Larry: if that happens, it indicates that a project isn’t getting the attention it needs. It seems unlikely that an active project would let lapse the work that was done to get the CII status. Daniel: a clear case of failure would be not meeting the SLA for addressing security vulnerability. | . | Next meeting: February 12, 2020 | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 [0:00-0:10] . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | GPU for CI . | Windows and Mac . | VFXPlatform 2020 . | Runtime testing with Houdini, Maya, Nuke, et al . | New projects . | . | Working groups [0:10-0:30] . | Framework (John)https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/129 . | CI working group was first example of this model . | Looking to move forward with working groups on number of subjects, discussed at face to face model . | Was done mostly ad hoc for CI working group, didn’t have specifically elected lead for the effort, specific timeline or deliverables. Ongoing group with short term goals based on individual needs of the projects. Has gone well for this particular effort. | Model suggested by John is more focused and time limited. | Gordon: like the idea of specific goals and specific timelines. | Daniel: does it make sense to have a process to set the goals of the working group at the TAC level? . | Gordon: as a general model, the TAC should focus its energies on making sure we tackle the right problems to get desired outcomes, and giving each working group opportunity to tackle issues “out of band”. Different challenges may require slightly different models. Seems to work well internally at Autodesk, so we can focus the time of the wider TAC group. | Python 3 example: there may be more focussed experts / people outside the TAC who would be a better fit for that particular activity. | Daniel: working groups is a good model for engagement. “What does it mean to be involved in a working group?”. Template lays out model where only the working group lead is officially designated, otherwise activities of the working group are open (to all). | . | Proposals . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Python 3 (Josh Minor) . | Pick this up early this year | . | USD . | Daniel: Cory has had background discussions with Guido and USD team at Pixar . | Daniel: 2 issues from face to face meeting. Answer request from Pixar to help with support effort on USD message boards to help relieve some of the load on the main USD developers. And effective forum for USD-related discussions. | Cory: discussion with the team on how to tackle the support burden, a lot of them related to building USD at individual facilities. Do we expect the chair of the USD team to be part of the USD team at Pixar? Daniel: we don’t have an answer based on our previous experience, it would make sense that it would be someone who is familiar with either the ASWF of USD. | Michael: several members of the TAC are responsible for USD implementation at their respective facilities, we probably want to be involved with how to help spread the adoption of USD, there’s a high level opportunity to help promote the adoption of USD at a high level. | Cory: can take that feedback back to the USD. Some concern from the USD mailing lists that having discussions on a separate forum might bifurcate some discussions / dilute. | Cory: most concrete area where USD team can use help is the support burden, especially related to building. | Eric / Cory: a bit of a chicken and egg situation between deciding what the group to do / meet the requirements of the working group document? Sean: shouldn’t the group decide what it wants to do? . | Daniel: this is a good “test case” for figuring out the scope of what a working group does. | Sean: if some amount of deep dive is needed by subject matter experts (who aren’t necessarily TAC members), seeding the working group with those members and task them with defining the scope of the working group might work best. | Gordon: agrees with Sean. TAC can define “what is the success of the group”, for instance “remove barriers to success and USD adoption in the industry”, the group can then come up with steps needed to meet this high level goal. “Here are some places we can help, perhaps through CI/CD infrastructure, or additional resources”. Help define what would be missing in current USD offering to help other studio adoption. | Eric: second phase besides focus on adoption could be efficiency of effort, make sure that different studios aren’t duplicating efforts related to USD. | Daniel: is Cory comfortable with the approach presented above? Cory: yes, but needs to make sure the Pixar USD team is OK. Some discussion on the usd-interest mailing list today. A lot of “community helping community” on that list. | Wave: could also have discussions about how we create USD assets, codify / define best practices to using USD. Cory: does that lead to bifurcation from existing mailing list / communication channels? . | Wave: Notes about USD . | Gordon: maybe once we have a list of areas we can focus on, at that point we need to have a working model for some aspects that need tight discussion with USD community. | Eric: does the Google Group have in person meetings outside of SIGGRAPH? Cory: not outside SIGGRAPH. Working group would be more focussed if it has regular calls for instance. | Sean: specific tasks and timelines may conflict with the goal of helping with ongoing support. | Daniel: we agree to defer to further discussion to establish scope and goals to first working group goal. Would Cory agree? Yes. | JF: should existing USD mailing list be used for working group discussions? Cory: could make sense, maybe as the main communication mechanism, or regular updates to that mailing list. | . | Other areas? . | Documentation . | Web site update . | . | . | . | Project proposal: OpenShadingLanguage (Larry) [0:30-0:40] . | https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/message/1196 . | No specific discussion on mailing list . | Larry: won’t spend too much time recapping email. Odd that the proposal came day after face to face meeting, but unfortunately couldn’t quite make that deadline for final sign off. Final OK came at 6PM on day of the meeting! . | Endorsement from Imageworks’ part on how well the ASWF has done. Would have been hesitant to make OSL first submission to ASWF, OSL is very important to SPI, but looking at the success of OCIO for instance, excited as to the future of OSL in ASWF. | GPU centric development is a big focus: project could benefit from more steering by stakeholders. | Project has hummed along smoothly over the last 10 years, has had a lot of active development, but that doesn’t mean it can’t use the help of being part of ASWF. | Fit with ASWF couldn’t be better: the majority of ASWF members are using, have contributed to, or are major users of systems that make use of OSL. | Gordon: thank you Larry! . | Daniel: we have quorum to vote on project incubation status, first step of project adoption to allow the project to start to move into the governance structure. | JF: how much can you leverage from previous project submissions? Larry: the project has already taken some steps to meet some of the work done on existing projects, for instance already at 88% for the CII badge status. Current plan is to model most of the governance documents on what was done for OCIO with minimal tweaks necessary. Should also help with legal / administrative clearances. Hopefully this project can help to move ASWF forward on some technical aspects, for instance OSL is already using GitHub Actions for CI, which we are looking at for other projects. And definitely need a strong GPU infrastructure, currently no way to test GPU contributions, and have seen some breakage due to lack of GPU enabled testing infrastructure. | Daniel: is there some internal GPU testing infrastructure? Larry: the internal version embedded in in-house renderer, so that highlights any breaks quickly, but no good / organized way to do it. Also have to make sure that even people working on non-GPU code don’t break the GPU path. | JT Nelson: Appleseed is now using OSL completely, they dropped their internal shader model, also moving from CPU to GPU. Can check with Appleseed team. | Larry: one of the next milestones is to assemble the right TSC, that should have not sure the developers, but also stakeholders such as “end clients”. Appleseed could provide someone. TSC meetings will be open, and should open up visibility. | Daniel: calling for vote, seconded by Wave, unanimous vote YES. Adopted into incubation stage. | . | Update on candidate projects [0:40-0:50] . | Media player (Darby) . | Interest in open source technologies for media review in facilities . | Darby Johnston is the author of the DJV playback application . | DJV has been around since 2004, cross platform, supports HDR . | Had lull in development over last couple years, but recently picked up development . | Transition from Sourceforge to GitHub . | Looking at ASWF documents as a guideline for some of the work being done on the project . | Recently released new version, not quite feature parity with previous version . | Looking at major features such as playlist (OpenTimelineIO integration), audio . | Looking at feedback from industry as to what features would be useful . | Looking at opening up the development process and getting more people involved . | Daniel: asking Henry to articulate some of our interests (from Foundation members) based on discussion from a few meetings ago. | Henry: many of the member facilities (and specifically DNeg) have had internal review tools, supporting various formats and capabilities, looking at end-of-life internal tools, evaluating some commercial offerings. Looking at new toolsets, codecs, don’t necessarily feel that all requirements are addressed by commercial offerings. Considering starting a new internal project, would be open source. | Darby: is the ASWF adding a media player as an incubation stage process, or this more just an information gathering process? . | Daniel: some of both, identified as an area of need / interest in ASWF surveys. Can one of the project chairs talk about how developer engagement has worked for ASWF projects? . | Michael: a big piece of it is getting a handle on who the users are. For OCIO the experience has been that forming a TSC has been beneficial to getting ideas going. Getting a TSC going, even informally has been very valuable. | Daniel: what has DJV had issues with, IP issues, closed source codecs, where ASWF could assist? . | Darby: would be helpful to have legal advice, codecs that don’t have open source versions, what are guidelines for incorporating those types of codecs in an open source project. Building and packaging has been taking too much of his time, so very interested in CI/CD infrastructure. GPU is GPU powered, so very interested in GPU testing infrastructure. Automated packaging infrastructure would help save a lot of time. | Brian: OpenCue working on packaging as well, and since working on end user applications, there could be some commonality there. | Darby: DJV has been my own project, guided by own wishes and desired, but would be good to build a roadmap once other developers are involved. Not always easy to get structured feedback from DJV users. Python integration identified as useful. | Gordon: do you have an idea as to project adoption / contributing to it? Darby: adoption: this is difficult, packages distributed through SourceForce, about 1000 downloads per week, seems to be used worldwide. Email feedback seems very international. Seems to be used a lot by the freelance community and smaller studios, not really in larger studios. Wasn’t trying to compete with commercial offerings. | JT: definitely promoted as playback tool in 100% open source pipelines. | Darby: would definitely be interested in working with studios with internal tools nearing end of life. Instead of developing tool from scratch, could smaller amount of resources be allocated to a shared project. | . | Rez . | . | CI updates [0:50-0:55] . | Working group . | GPU for CI with dynamic instances . | Will find practical way to move beyond current proof of concept | . | Github Actions . | A lot of interest in moving towards GitHub Actions, will be tested out in some projects . | GitHub Actions API . | GitHub CLI for managing PRs and issues . | . | . | Next meeting: February 26, 2020 . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 [0:00-0:05] | OpenShadingLanguage adoption (Daniel, Larry) [0:05-0:15] . | Taken to Governing Board for endorsement, not strictly necessary by charter, but helps with resource deployment | Was received with enthusiasm and unanimous vote | Larry: sent invitations to various people for TSC membership, some have accepted, some are thinking it over / checking with their organizations. One very good offer from someone who wasn’t already on his list. Will report next week, hold first meeting. | Working on governing documents, mostly a repeat of OCIO, changing names as necessary, borrowing from other projects, but hopefully sticking to the script as much as possible to make it easy to graduate. | . | Google Summer of Code (Larry) [0:15-0:20] . | Congrats on work done by Larry on GSOC. | Tiago joining us on this meeting as a GSCO student. | Larry: ASWF is a mentoring organization announced by Google, not clear how many paid positions will be announced, may be based on number of student applications. Have seen student activity on a couple of projects. Asking project leads about feedback? | Brian: 5 or 6 folks have reached out via email or GitHub, a couple of small PRs. Had to “tone down” the excitement a bit until the program actually starts. | Michael: several people joined slack, a PR submitted, interest in proposed tasks. | Cary: no one reached out to OpenEXR yet. | Aloys: one person reached out to Docker project. They didn’t really say they were part of GSOC program, was assuming they were. Question: do we have to get confirmation that they are “part of the program”? Larry: currently no one is “part of the program”, they will apply in a few weeks, and we will decide who we would want. | Daniel: enthusiasm and support at GSOC program from Governing Board, including other activities within the Academy, including any other activities that would involve students, for instance physical meetups. | Larry: want to encourage everybody if they know students, former interns to point them to our GSCO projects, recruiting is allowed and encouraged. Also the mentoring organization gets a small stipend per student, including some travel allowance to the Google GSOC in person conference at Google (Mountain View). Speakers are a “who’s who” of the open source world. Larry very enthusiastic about this event. | . | USD Working Group (Cory) [0:20-0:30] . | Cory: have filled out proposed form by John. Haven’t created GitHub repo yet (coordinate with LF releng?). | Worded very broadly for now, not a lot of specific language. Encourage best practices, adoption at large in the community. First working group meeting to work on setting more specific goals. | Proposed times on when the meeting might take place, John will send out Doodle poll (see link) and will send out email to TAC list. Looking at people on the TAC to propose potential members. | Daniel: can share view only version of the project templatefor now: | Cory: aim is to support the adoption efforts through consolidation and sharing of best practices, and helping with issues raised in various USD support channels where possible | Not a steering committee: members on the WG will have the same influence on USD as already participating members in the USD community | JF: is there a need to try to leverage the ASWF CI infrastructure? Cory: could be a project, but not necessarily a goal. Would like to be doing CI in the open rather than internally using Jenkins, and having public binaries. Daniel: this should be an achievable goal given some of the infrastructure already in place. | Daniel: key part is that we engage constructively with USD team. Let’s move on to the next steps as proposed. | . | Python 3 Working Group (Josh) [0:30-0:35] . | Daniel: Josh won’t have the bandwidth to take on this project, need to look at someone else, either in the TAC or outside | Had some back and forth with John in the WG template to reflect that the person leading a WG doesn’t have to be a member of the TAC | Is anyone in a position to volunteer themselves, or propose someone external? Can be discussed now or later / off meeting. There is still a lot of interest in leveraging the foundation to achieve this goal. | . | Project Repository Privileges (Dan) [0:35-0:45] . | Has come up a few times in the context of repo setup | Address friction points, project TSE don’t have full access, they need higher level access. GitHub has now added a Maintainer level which offers most of the privileges of Administrator level. | Proposal | Summary of GitHub access levels | Dan not on this call. Have TSC chairs looked at the PR? Does anyone have experience with the other levels of GitHub access control? Some ambiguity as to what some of these permission levels entail. | Kimball: no experience | Daniel: to be followed up with LF releng and Dan at the CI meeting, then take back to TAC meeting for a policy decision. | . | CI Working Group [0:45-0:50] . | GPU agents (JF) . | TAC thread | Supports AWS, Azure, GCP | Uses Terraform Cloud to store state between jobs | Works, but not yet a robust solution, still a PoC | Potential damage limited by only being able to spin up a single GPU accelerated VM per account by default without raising limits (which requires interaction with CSP support). | Azure Pipelines only for now, need to look at GitHub Actions | Daniel: asking Sean whether this looks like it makes sense? Sean: can report offline, not too concerned about optimizing for cost. | Daniel: logical next step would be to take to LF releng team, would they be ready to take this on as supported infrastructure. | . | . | JT: Update on Linux Scale Expo in Pasadena next week, have some passes available | Updates on candidate projects | Varia: . | Daniel: Should aim to solidify TAC goals for this year, will be shared on the mailing list | . | Next meeting . | 11 March 2020 | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Emily: starting planning for SIGGRAPH, contingent to current COVID-19 situation, there will be a contingency plan / online only if needed. Looking at feedback on last year’s Open Source, originally thinking on Sunday, now looking at Monday (full / single day). Last year the day was packed, can’t pack everything into a single day. Looking at shorter BoFs or 2 tracks (with non overlapping interests). | USD Working Group (Cory) . | Cory: Well attended first call last Wednesday, minutes will be posted soon. Went over aims of the USD WG with the USD leads. Template as written right now is as specific as we would want it to be. Desire for collaborative development, also a schema working group. Trying to make sure these are currently not in scope as per the template document. Main focus is driving adoption and defining best practices, as well as assistance with support on existing channels (usd-interest mailing list). | Repository has been set up: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/wg-usd . | Next meeting (50m) set for next Wednesday, more time to discuss aspects of formation, should be able to come up with consensus as to where the WG is going. | Should be possible to announce WG to usd-interest list soon, didn’t want to end up with too many people on the original call. | Does it make sense to discussion on the usd-interest list rather than the tac list? . | General feedback is that this first meeting went well. | . | Python 3 Working Group? (Daniel) . | Daniel: still looking for someone to lead Python 3 WG, a few people are working on answers to Daniel based on their respective organization . | Larry: do we have an “elevator pitch” as to what the working group is trying to do? . | Daniel: lots of individual efforts from studios on efforts to port to Python 3, would be useful to share the results of some of these efforts, libraries / modules that were written. Create an environment where we can go beyond just Python 3 support in ASWF projects. | LA Pipeline meetup planed on Python 3 on 25-March . | Daniel: significant effort was required. Cory: NVIDIA helping with USD, trying to get code to be compatible with 2 and 3, using Python Futurize. Some time in late spring / early summer plan to be building dependency chain including Python 3. Process is planned, not expecting to switch active productions until 2020H2 or 2021H1. Depending on external DCCs of course. Henry: So far has been a semi ad-hoc approach, I’m bringing in a project lead for this project who starts end-of-March who may be a candidate to lead the ASWF WG. | . | Repository access levels (Dan / Andy) . | Dan: was discussed extensively in CI WG. We are looking at trying to eliminate some of the back and forth with LF releng group and make debugging easier. Not possible to see how repos are configured. 2 specific areas: . | Adding and editing secret variables (specifically for download of Houdini) . | Modify branch protection rules: number of approvals, mandatory vs optional checks. | . | PR . | Andy: back and forth on the PR, general agreement from lf releng, just needs TAC review / approval, some sort of vote. | Dan: maintainer level doesn’t give much above write level privileges. | Henry: are there specific privileges you get with admin that are required? . | JF: you need a token with administrative permissions to generate a registration-token to allow self-hosted runners to register with GitHub Actions . | Dan: will use caching to work around some of the issues of not having access to secrets in branches . | Daniel: calling for vote. No dissenting, Eric abstains as not active in CI. Motion passes. Thank you to Dan and Andrew for moving this forward. | . | Google Summer of Code Update (Larry) . | Some of the lists have seen some requests from some students. | Michael Dolan: 2 students working on proposals on OCIO, will be reviewed with mentors before they submit official proposals. Tackling issues put up on GitHub, following requirements in the outline, and creating PRs. Time of submission is approaching quickly. | Larry: may be the first time that OCIO accepts a PR from someone who isn’t a well known member of the color science community, hopefully will also happen on the other projects. Deadline in a couple of weeks, then we have a couple of weeks to respond to Google with how many slots we feel should get sponsored, and designate mentors to pair. | Daniel: hopefully this can help to make our projects somewhat easier to engage with. | Larry: what does it take to get a somewhat more junior person from outside the community to contribute. | Michael: a couple of PRs included code that hadn’t been compiled before. | . | CI updates . | Working group . | GPU agents (JF) . | Supports AWS / GCP / Azure . | Uses Terraform cloud for persistent state . | Runs on Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions . | GitHub Actions: lack of “secret files” means workarounds for ssh private keys (encode LFs as _), GITHUB_TOKEN doesn’t have administrative privileges and cannot be used to generate runner registration token, need to generate specific PAT . | . | Daniel: what would be the minimal steps required from projects and lf-releng to bring this into project builds. | Andrew: has not had a chance to look at it in detail. There are secrets involved. Should we focus on GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines? Will need a request to the helpdesk for the cloud keys. Discussions with GitHub on secrets in fork: secrets management in forks is coming, will be possible in the future. Also possible to limit running CI runs based on approval from project maintainers. Hopefully can designate some contributors as being able to run CI workflows without approval. Jenkins has more protection for workflows than GitHub Actions. We don’t want PRs that can modify code and workflows at the same time, they should be different PRs. | Dan: GitHub allows modifying which branch a PR ends up, so could point to an integration branch, and only run the GPU testing. Could use a comment / tag to trigger a GPU test run. | Daniel: how do we integrate offer from some of the ASWF member companies (cloud providers), can they be managed in a single pool through lf-releng, or through a sub pool. Andrew: no easy answer, especially for AWS due to how billing works. May need to be fleshed out offline. | . | . | Project Updates . | OpenShadingLanguage adoption (Larry) . | Looks like a quorum to get a TSC started, took some back and forth with some of the stakeholders . | Trying to schedule a first meeting . | There are a couple of gaps we have: we don’t have great coverage for people who really know Windows, this has plagued the project all along. Also the list of potential contributors severely lacks diversity, so if anyone has suggestions, please contact Larry. Would be nice to broaden the scope of voices participating and actively participating in the project. Hoping that some of the TSC members become developers. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Rez: would need to be relicensed with a more ASWF-compatible license, which is a non trivial effort. | . | Next meeting . | 25 March 2020 | . | .

People may be more available to work on our projects? | May be people looking for new positions / time to invest in getting familiar with our projects | . | areas of technical need for studios . | Our workflows are changing, anything we can address as a group? For instance lots of discussion about review tools, an area we have already discussed in the TAC, but what about review tools that work remotely: how to work on less reliable connections, capture the social aspect of reviews, secure distribution of media. | Daniel: review tools have been identified as an area of interest, lots of review tools out there, open source and commercial. Most do very similar things, and are expensive to maintain and are critical infrastructure. There isn’t an obvious tool as to what tool we could collaborate on. Should we add to an existing OSS tool and add features needed by studio. Most obvious candidate is DJV, Darby has joined a previous TAC call. He doesn’t have a very clear idea of his customer based / requirements (nature of OSS projects). Most of the r studios are using commercial / proprietary tools. | Larry: mostly hearing in the big studios that for the most part they are working at home through one of several schemes to VPN and access their usual workstation via remote view (HP RGS / Teradici). Not much changes for most artists / developers except working in a different location. But a subset of users is highly affected such as editorial (working on air-gapped systems), color grading. | Daniel: remote desktop approach is pretty effective, doesn’t capture all workflows, issues with constrained bandwidth, issues with fidelity of updates with full screen video. Social collaboration aspect of shared reviews is lost. Also using shared review tools. | Michael: Netflix has created document for Remote Editorial workflow. A number of proprietary paid services are available, but not every project will want to pay for those. Remote Editorial Memo (during COVID-19) | Bill: editorial and color correct workflows are challenging. Have used SyncSketch and found some value in that. All artists are working at some level of productivity. | . | VES Technology Committee collaborative document, everyone can contribute via comments and we’ll incorporate to document (more systems oriented). https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iP1AWDAMvNlymT626PQbKUfC52wqyIhoqoGsNn-nOLA/edit# | #discuss-dr on StudioSysadmins Slack | . | Technical Project updates . | Daniel: Any particular risk factors? Availability of key contributors? Potential issues on CI infrastructure? Using largely public services with open configurations helps. | Projects seems to be in pretty good shape overall, broader range of people involved, should help with resilience. | After previous meeting we discussed delegating more repo permissions, that came up on governing board meeting yesterday. Linux Foundation is also a distributed and resilient organization, most members are already working from home and geographically distributed. Nothing we need to immediately act on, but please share any issues that may come up. | OpenVDB | OpenColorIO . | Doug: No COVID concerns raised during slack discussion, all used to working remotely. Roadmap proceeding on track. Minor disruptions as people get used to WFH, but still on track. Still very early in this crisis, not clear how things will evolve over time as the economic impact rolls out. Need to keep monitoring closely and respond as appropriate. But so far so good. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: pretty quiet, cancelled TSC last two weeks, not necessarily COVID related, but everyone busy with other commitments. Succeeded in addressing most outstanding issues and PR, so kind of quiet time. Longer term goal of bigger release around SIGGRAPH time, haven’t really discussed the implications of the current situation, need to strategize how to tackle some of the larger issues targeted for this release. Expect to be quiet for a few more weeks as we “settle into the new normal”. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: nothing major to report, drop in contributions, but code reviews are still moving through. Reduced activity but moving along. | . | OpenTimelineIO . | Josh: OTIO moving forward, conf calls with Avid and Netflix scheduled for this week. Pleased with level of activity so far. Some delays expected, but nothing too significant. | . | OpenShadingLanguage . | Larry: last week was supposed to have the first TSC meeting, but postponed due to studios transitioning to WFH. Expect to hold first TSC some time next week. Don’t anticipate specific issues, having access to work machines from may actually help a bit. | . | . | Google Summer of Code update . | Larry: End of week is deadline for student applications. Then 2 week period for organizations to evaluate proposals and ask for support, was extended to 3 weeks because of COVID situation. After students are accepted there is a period of “community bonding”, that seems that have already (informally) started, helped by requirement to have students submit a PR. | Doug / OCIO: 8-9 applications so far, 5-6 seem serious. Requiring people to do a PR (Larry suggestion) really help to find people who are really serious, lots of back and forth with some of the students. Looking forward to having good participation this summer. | Josh / OTIO : 3-4 students have been asking, submitting PR. Misjudged the scope / size of suggested projects, what was thought to be a large project turned out to be a single PR, some projects thought to be small turned out to be much more complicated. One proposal was a student sharing a Google Doc. Is there an official place for these proposals? Doug: should be on the GSoC official site. Josh: looked there but didn’t find it. Doug: make sure that we sign up for the mentorship program, need to sign up for this with Google. | Brian / OpenCue: PR requirement is great, similar issues on scoping. Encouraging prospective students to share their proposals on a Google Doc to allow more back and forth. Propose a goal for the summer that would be only part of the project, and then a stretch goal. 15-20 people have reached out via email, 4-5 proposals, may go up to 10 by the deadline. Quite a few are good. Didn’t realize that it could be a “full time job” to deal with the email traffic. Larry: it’s a good investment, visibility of the project will outlast the SoC, so upfront cost is worth it. Number of serious students interested in our projects is higher than expected. A couple of students asked about multiple proposals / interested in multiple project ideas. Should they submit multiple proposals, or a single proposal covering multiple projects? Larry: they can submit up to 3 proposals across organizations, we can probably do whatever we want, if a student wants to propose against 2 separate ASWF projects, we can pick the one where we think is the best fit. | Dan / OpenVDB: 4-5 people reached out, no applications yet. May be related to “barrier to entry” of OpenVDB. | Carry / OpenEXR: a few people reached out, but no proposals yet. No specific emails other than the trial PR. Daniel: any areas identified that would be worth proposing? Cary: Put together a set of proposals, but no one is “biting” at those yet. | . | CI updates . | Working group | Still trying to work out policies for controlling the use of GPU build agents (billing, external PRs). Andy / Sean / JF ? Hopefully some progress by next week’s CI meeting. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting | . ",

    "content": ". | New member introduction: Christopher Kulla (OSL TSC Chair) [0:00-0:10] . | OSL adoption process, first TSC meeting happened last week, chair was elected, Chris Kula from Imageworks. | Chris: Rendering Lead at Imageworks, will be chair of OSL project. Had first meeting, Larry in process of transitioning things over, establishing founding documents. Leveraged experience from OCIO, should be fairly straightforward process. Should be able to get this done in next meeting or two. | Project will have an architect position: Larry Gritz taking that position. | . | Google Summer of Code (Larry) [0:10-0:20] . | Last time we met the applicants had just come in and deadline had just closed. | Lots of activity in the last week to narrow down the applicants. | Larry: applications have been triaged, interesting process. 75 applications, ⅔ of which were “not serious” (mostly empty or one line, or elaborate proposals not pertinent to our organization). But 22 were valid proposals, next step is for projects to look at ones that are relevant to them, rank and evaluate them. | Each project to evaluate a “front runner” they want to go for. Official Google guidelines say that first time organizations will get only one to two, but we are an unusual organization that covers a number of projects with people who have experience with the process, so perhaps we might get more? . | Meeting next week to come up with a unified list, and submit list to Google on April 21st. | Brian: got 4 or 5 strong proposals. Larry: hopefully people who don’t get selected might still want to “stick around”. | Michael: 1 or 2 good candidates for OCIO . | Larry: 1 very strong front runner for OpenEXR, with a couple of others as well. | Daniel: should we take up the topic of how many students with Google? Larry: we technically tell them a minimum and maximum number. Daniel: the model of a foundation requiring multiple students should not be an exception. | Daniel: how do we engage all of the good students who submitted, we should very actively target those students. Projects accepted under the Google program get additional structure and resources, but what about projects that are valid but don’t make it in GSoC? . | Larry: we haven’t done the hard part of mentoring students yet, we’ll soon know how much time / effort it takes to mentor a student. If there is extra money available to sponsor students, could be done at other times throughout the year. | Daniel: as a group we have the resources and authority to pursue those approaches. | Larry: if we only get GSoC for 2 students but there are 4 outstanding proposals… . | Gordon: getting students productive could take a significant amount of time. | Chris Kulla: degree of involvement with any particular student can take very different amounts of time based on who the person is. | John: there are parts of Linux Foundation Community Bridge that could be used if we decided to sponsor students directly. Daniel: Community Bridge can offer the additional step of linking a company that needs a specific feature to a specific activity. | Daniel: to what extent do the students who applied overlap with our Diversity &amp; Inclusion goals? Larry: pretty good for diversity along the international and age axis, but probably not along other axis. | Gordon: if there was at least one opportunity to help meet some D&amp;I goals, that could be useful. | Bill: has Google provided info on diversity from last year? Larry: probably but hasn’t seen it yet. Google typically publishes blog entries on the topic. | Daniel: more feedback at next TAC meeting. | . | CI updates (Working Group) [0:20-0:30] . | Migrate to GitHub Actions by July? . | Focus on GitHub Actions for all projects instead of trying to support both Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions. Will try to migrate all projects to GitHub Actions. Helps with making subtle differences between the two systems, such as a single credential / secret sharing system. | . | GPU setup: OCIO on GitHub Actions and AWS . | Choose project and cloud provider: OCIO and AWS | . | Michael: started migrating project to GitHub Actions this week, syntax is fairly similar to Azure Pipelines, shouldn’t be a huge undertaking. Some cool features in GitHub Actions, non-CI actions such as marking stale pull requests, should be a positive move in general. | OpenVDB has already advanced along this route. | Brian: OpenCue has done some basic research, but no major progress yet. Proposed timeframe should work. | John: commonality of infrastructure is a goal, so it’s not just the current 6 projects. | JF: aswf-sample-project opened ticket to move to ASWF GitHub organization. | JF: would be really helpful if the ASWF web site was backed by GitHub. John: Daniel could bubble this up to the Board. Will contact Emily for high level updates to the web site. | Michael: have ticket for OCIO with releng once moved to GitHub Actions . | Chris: OSL will be eager to test the GPU support as well. OSL is already on GitHub Actions. Michael: if OSL is ready before OCIO, they can just go ahead. Larry: if someone wants to use OSL as the test bed for GitHub Actions, go ahead since they already have that in place. Chris: happy to volunteer to get this going. | Chris: is there any kind of alignment in term of matrix of configurations we want to try (VFX platform years). Daniel: very good question, something that has been discussed in the past but no uniform guidance so far. Most projects on Linux are using the Docker images from Aloys project, there’s some interesting complexity with the current year being still in flux, USD, Python 2 or 3… Larry: the Reference Platform doesn’t make explicit statements as to how many years back of the platform should be supported. Not always clear how far back you have to support. Michael Min: agreed. Daniel: OpenVDB has a very clear position on these questions. Kimball: answer will be different if you are part of the VFX Platform or not. Also non-Linux platforms have the least amount of consistency right now. | Michael Dolan: once you get beyond 10 concurrent jobs your CI time goes up a lot, OCIO mostly testing against VFX Reference Platform 2019, even testing 2 years you can end up with 15 different jobs for every PR. | Larry: is there logic in the GitHub Actions to select which combinations of builds we want to try depending on the type of build? Michael: yes, OCIO does this right now: there’s a nightly build if there’s been a commit, also runs SonarCloud, but does not run on PRs. Possible to test which type of build is running and skip some combinations accordingly. | . | Zoom guidelines (John) [0:30-0:35] . | GitHub PR . | Based on CNCF guidelines. | Zoom is the current choice for a lot of online collaboration, and many security implications. | Some issues linked with the Zoom platform itself, others linked to setup (“Zoom Bombing”). | Everyone will need a Zoom account to join a meeting, additional controls on screen sharing, moderator control. Can also password protect private meetings. | Also general best practices: how to deal with someone who is being inappropriate in a meeting, along with good ideas for a meeting. | Daniel: what about company systems that use “rooms” and “bridges”, will this cause an issue? John: should not interfere, will need to enter the password if you join by phone. What about if you are using a SIP client? May need help to test some of the combinations. | Daniel: can always use the TAC mailing list to note that there’s been a change of configuration / help anyone who has issues connecting. John: we can add some explicit language to the document as to who to contact in case of problems. | . | Code of Conduct for ASWF / Projects (John) [0:35-0:40] . | GitHub PR . | A lot of our projects have aligned with the Linux Foundation LLC Code of Conduct. | Tried to clarify which project is lining up on what. | Larry noticed that we have 4 projects that have some specific changes, is that OK? . | Larry: copied the OpenEXR document when creating OSL, but John noticed that there are a few changes that paraphrase the Linux Foundation CoC. | Larry: less aligning existing projects, more that there should be a sensible, single default for new projects. | Larry: many open source communities have long discussions on the topic, having a single default one can help with that, but don’t need to change any project that have already established one retroactively. | John: we can also just accept the CoC from a new project that has already created one that generally lines up. | . | Working Group updates [0:40-0:50] . | Template PR GitHub . | Python 3 . | Productive meeting of the LA Pipeline Meetup on the topic of Python 3, should TAC partner with that group for instance? . | Good international participation, recording is available: . | . | USD . | USD WG suspended for now due to current situation . | Daniel: got some questions as to whether the TAC / Foundation could help with to support the WG, this WG needs high level of involvement by Pixar. | Daniel: are there specific areas where we could make some contributions to the goals of this WG? . | Larry: just how suspended is this? Or do we expect this to be a long term thing? USD-related needs at SPI are not shrinking? . | Cory: not a long term suspension by any means, a lot of workload from supporting current productions, so don’t want to add load to the USD team, but should be able to re-engage soon. Even things that USD team has asked for help still require involvement from USD team. | Daniel: current timeframe for suspension is through end of April, but to be revisited. | Cory: asking Larry, which are the USD-related activities at SPI that might be helped by the WG? Larry: interested in “how should we organize shots / layers / sequences”, “how to deal with areas where there are no published schemas”. Looking forward to a forum to help discuss and determine best practices, and hopefully get guidance from others who have already made progress on these topics. Cory: some of this might be done without the involvement of the USD teams, but of course Pixar USD team has a lot of experience using USD on movies. Larry: SPI happy to throw some resources, have already contributed several PRs to the project. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Emily and Wave have been working on this topic. | Specific proposal is to put together a WG. | Emily: create a more formal WG, not everyone on the TAC may be the best person to drive these efforts. TAC members should look inside their own organizations to see if there is someone who would be interested / qualified to join this effort. Bill: should people interested reach out directly to Emily? Emily: yes, also should there be some kind of formal “vote” to establish a WG? Daniel: yes, as per the above discussion on the more formalized WG process. Emily: want to put together a short list of people interested in taking part in this effort. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | . ",

    "content": ". | Recording of TAC and TSC meetings (Daniel) [0:00-0:05] . | Everyone should be aware that meetings are now being recorded, do we feel this is good with respect to transparency / full access to our discussion, or is it better to stick to written notes where some editing / redaction is possible. | Josh: is the motivation to allow better access to people who couldn’t access the meeting? John: there is no requirement that meetings need to be recorded, but it is important to stress transparency. CNCF / Kubernetes records their meetings. Good for people considering engaging to see what the community looks like. Also TAC meetings are open to the public and are thus on “public record”. But it is not a hard requirements for projects to do this, but it is seen as a “best practice”. Daniel: can help to make a TAC meeting more approachable. | Has anyone watched those recordings? They aren’t easily found right now. Eric: we may want to way costs vs benefits. Some projects actually put their recordings on YouTube. | Written notes provides “temporal compression” compared to having to watch the whole thing. Some members are expressing concerns over privacy, or self censorship. | Could someone request recordings specifically when they can’t attend? . | Andrew: projects that don’t record only have meeting notes, projects require “immutable minutes” for auditing purposes. But there have been cases where members have gone back to the recordings to help clarify what was captured in the minutes, in some projects the minutes are very sparse and don’t capture the discussions that lead to an actual decision. So you can understand more what the discussions that lead to the decision. | Daniel: perhaps the recording should be done, but access shouldn’t be automatic “to the world”, access should be on request. | Daniel: TAC meetings been recorded for the last 2 or 3 meetings but not published. What about TSC meetings? John: unsure, some of the TSCs are using different Zoom rooms, so no clear answer right now. | Daniel: we should have a vote on the topic, we should defer that vote to the next meeting so we can discuss over email. | . | Agenda automation via GitHub (John) [0:05-0:10] . | Pull Request . | John: Some other communities such as Node.JS are doing this. GitHub actions brings some really interesting integrations, allowing GitHub Issues to be used to track progress on issues and automate the collection of these Issues to automatically generate agenda. | Not a hard requirement of course, seeing if there’s interest. Can tweak deadline for when agenda gets closed off. | Trying to reduce the amount of operational / admin work. | Any project could use this process as well for their TSC. Could be added to the aswf-sample-project template project. | Chris: since OSL is just getting started, would definitely be interested in taking a look at that workflow. Started on the assumptions that Google Docs may be a simpler way to manage these documents, but even a single Google Doc is annoying from a formatting point of view. | John: happy to work with OSL on this. | Chris: hopefully the process is not too complicated / intricate so it doesn’t introduce an additional maintenance burden. John: toolchain is design to be simple, you just set your meeting frequency, and the interval before a meeting for generating the meeting agenda. Creates it as a single GitHub Issue that collectively contains the meeting agenda and all the linked Issues as meeting items. Output from GitHub Issues is Markdown, so can add automatic headers for instance. | Daniel: a project using GitHub Issues for tracking / reporting, this could work quite well. Less clear if this works for the TAC? Larry: this is the other way around, don’t want to clutter the Issues list on code projects with discussion items, should only be for the code. Prefer a live Google Doc for OSL, archive to Markdown only once every couple of months. | John: depends on how projects want to operate. In Javascript projects their process is driven by GitHub Issues and PRs, so it makes sense for these projects, and helps with transparency, but it can indeed add clutter. We want to make sure we provide tools that potentially make projects easier to work with, but no obligation to use those. Still worth documenting in the sample project as options to use for new projects. | Daniel: would it be possible to point at a project that is already using this system as an example? John: will provide an example. Daniel: open to try this on the TAC repo as an example for the projects. | Larry: if we have contacts at GitHub, it would be interesting to engage with their engineers / product people to help provide explicit tools to manage project agendas instead of “hijacking” the Issues / PR projects. | Chris: what about using the GitHub Wiki for the project? John: LF has great contacts with GitHub, so happy to engage with them with workflow ideas. | . | Project Admins (Daniel, Dan) [0:10-0:15] . | OpenVDB TSC voted to grant Dan Bailey as Project Admin . | Other projects could follow if they feel the need . | Dan: process has gone fine, not clear if he has Admin rights yet. Andrew: please put in LF releng support ticket. Dan: will do. | . | Feedback on process . | . | Google Summer of Code Update (Larry) [0:15-0:25] . | Larry: ASWF got a total of 3 slots, better than the 1-2 we were told to expect, but less than the 5 we were hoping for . | Will need to boil down 5 top choices down to 3, short deadline on April 30th, but when students apply to multiple projects / organizations, they may accept the first organization that offers the slot, so best to do this ASAP to avoid losing students we really want to get. | . | ASWF Sample Project (JF) [0:25-0:30] . | Looking for a co-reviewer: Daniel happy to be a co-reviewer. Anyone else from the other projects? Kimball: happy to do it as well. JF to open ticket with lf releng. | Daniel: we need to make it clear what are the processes we’ve been deciding on, we need to update some of our early documents, especially what is on the external web site. Working with Emily to update that documentation. Emily: anything on the website is easy to fix, I can update within a day. | . | OpenShadingLanguage adoption Update (Chris) [0:30-0:35] . | Chris: working away at the onboarding process, moving forward smoothly? Larry: the big copyright notice PR was done, license scan was performed. Transferred a couple of domains to ASWF, a bit of delay to CLAs, Pixar rep brought up a legal issue, waiting for the lawyers to decide that the current language is still the right one. Moving quickly on everything. Minimal CLA, identical to the one in the ASWF template, and which is being used by OCIO which was already cleared by Sony / Imageworks legal, would rather avoid having to get that changed, but want to make sure other organizations aren’t prevented from submitting code. | . | OpenEXR Update (Cary) . | We’re hoping for two GSoC students, one to work on the Imath library and one to do some compression benchmarks. -&gt; will likely only be one. | We’re planning a 2.5 release shortly, bug fixes and small features. | John Mertic is having the LF design group mock up some options for a new OpenEXR logo. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion Update (Emily) . | Several names were submitted . | Current contact spreadsheet . | Need to identify a potential chair to lead the effort: ideally the chair person would act as a TSC chair, but with a shorter time commitment. | . | SIGGRAPH (Emily) . | Would like to propose that our Open Source Day is done as a virtual event, either before or after SIGGRAPH. Conference Center in DC may be repurposed for COVID response. Likely that the conference will be cancelled or very low turnout, and overall cost will be lower as well. If SIGGRAPH does go forward in person we can still do some events (TAC BoF for instance), but no individual project BoFs, which would be held during our own virtual event. | Looking for feedback from people who have attended other virtual events. | Daniel: may not be able to fly internationally. Larry: hard to imagine getting on a plane in that timeframe, so makes sense to try to put together the best virtual event we can. | Daniel: there have been a lot of events which have switched to virtual, any positive or negative feedback? Wave: did a big face to face event with the team, pre-recording keynote event and uploading it to a central server for others to watch and then being on Slack while others watched, seemed to go well. So a mix of Zoom / interactive sessions and pre-recorded presentations can be helpful. | Bill: feedback that having a Slack channel to continue the discussion after the presentation helps. Wave: having separate threads per talk also helps to keep track. And can ask questions after the fact. Kimball: also helps for people in different timezones. | Emily: looking at last year, most people didn’t stay for the whole day, will people dedicate a whole day / few hours in the day, or should it be broken up into chunks? . | Wave: his talk was pre-recorded, but then agreed on a time for as many people to “press play” at the same time. Or could be streamed at a specific time? But schedule defined “communal chat time”. | Emily: event team has been putting together a look at available platforms. | Daniel: mitigates the technical risk. | Emily: great for the talks, but more difficult for BoFs which are supposed to be more interactive. Wave: Slack or Discord could work well for that. Nick: prefers Slack, the most annoying events are on Twitch due to visual distractions of the platform. | Eric: IEEE VR conference had issues with Zoom for video distribution. Nick: was really difficult to cross reference between the recording and the Twitch stream. Wave: put the pre-recorded sessions on Box, and everyone had pre downloaded it. | Daniel: what’s the best place to discuss this? We should make some time on the next TAC meeting. | Eric: a big decision is to keep it co-located in time, or moving before or after, Digipro is struggling with this question. Emily: by doing it before or after we gain more flexibility, but can’t benefit from being on the SIGGRAPH schedule. Sean: are there other opportunities for tie-in with SIGGRAPH? Emily: if we do BoF at SIGGRAPH we can use that to promote an event after SIGGRAPH. Will get in touch with ACM to figure out what’s the best way to coordinate. Opportunities to cross promote with Digipro, Pipeline Conference. | Daniel: looks like we have a clear endorsement of the plan to go virtual. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Now that things are settling into some kind of normalcy, we need to keep track of this. | Have been staying in contact with Res, no specific update for now. | . | CI Process: actively working on GPU support, OCIO has moved to GitHub Actions. | Meeting of USD working group should happen in May. | Next meeting . | .

We did well for a first year, 3 students will be getting paid for full time work. | Next steps in the court of the mentors in the individual projects. Between now and the end of May is the “getting to know you” period, may be superfluous for us since students have already been involved and understand the project since we did this in the phase where we required students to submit a PR to demonstrate their interest. | Larry: encourage the projects to have the students start working right away if possible. | Later in the summer the mentors will need to grade the students at halfway point and end of summer. | Project leaders should send words of encouragement to students who didn’t get picked, there’s always next year, and contributions are always welcome. | Brian: student proposals can be changed until June 1st, so should review in more details. OpenCue doing a full TSC review of project proposal. | Larry: don’t have to stick exactly to what was proposed, mentor and students can work to rescope proposed. | Mentors can be shuffled around until end of month. | . | ASWF response to COVID-19 (David) [0:15-0:25] . | David: COVID-19 has done lots of damage to the industry, and is changing the way we work. And it’s going to change the world we come back to when it’s over. What do we do about it? . | “COVID-19 mitigation plan” was the first name, but this is an opportunity to get ASWF to the next level. Presented proposal at last week’s Board Meeting, which is up for discussion. | Goals prior to COVID-19 are being put on hold, and replaced with: . | ASWF Phase 2: . | Take care of our own . | Take care of our community . | Double down on our own mission . | . | Take care of our own: 6 month membership extension for all Foundation member companies. | Take care of our own: Engage on planning for ASWF Phase 2 . | Take care of our community: create the ASWF Fund to support open source projects . | Take care of our community: leverage Linux Foundation Community Bridge . | $50K seed funding + $100K matching funds . | TAC has fundamental role to play in defining the kind of projects that would receive grants from ASWF Fund . | Proposal is to start with a $10K grant per quarter . | Try to help people dealing with furloughs, scaling down in companies . | Continue to look into new projects such as USD, remote review / approval project, any other tools we may need in a post COVID-19 world . | Propose to discuss on board and TAC mailing lists. | TAC members should look into the LF Community Bridge site . | Timeline: board has modified meeting schedule, goal is to have plan completed before June 30th. | 2020 continues to be the year of Open Source, this is the opportunity to grow our footprint. | The open source model proved resistant to COVID-19, now is the time to educate our industry to show the advantages of work in the “open source way”. | Daniel: a few meetings back we surveyed how the changes to working process had impacted our projects. At that early stage we felt relatively lucky that most of our key contributors and participants had not been adversely affected. Is that still the case? Apparently so. | Daniel: in other foundations, Community Bridge has been used to fund key contributors, so this could be used in situations where some of our key developers may have lost their primary source of income. For instance projects initially targeting Google SoC that didn’t make the GSoC “cut” could be funded this way. Either Interns or Core Developers. | Daniel: a number of times we’ve discussed that some of our key projects have lacked core capabilities (Windows toolchain for instance), so this could be a good time to identify specific projects that could be tackled. | Henry: when would this be announced publicly so we can start communicating with people? David: if we decide to go ahead with the fund, it will be announced publicly, we need specific criteria to decide how the funds will be allocated. For instance we could have a submission form, list the criteria we are expecting. | Daniel: if for instance there was work not specifically for one of our project, but could make it a better candidate, or another tool that is valuable to the community, that could also be in scope. | JF: should we reuse as much of the GSoC process as possible since it’s proven to work? David: possibly, but don’t want to be too restrictive. Larry: process was put in place in a different context, someone who is known to the community coming from a VFX facility may not require as much vetting. | Larry: our core skills are being able to create good production software in an open source way, is one of the opportunities to think about where does this point us in terms of missing tools or workflows that someone needs to develop. Can we pool our resources to avoid duplication of effort. David: TAC is ideally positioned to focus on this question, we know all the tools and legacy in this industry, the “new world” is going to be a lot more distributed, we need a reinvention of our tools. Larry: Imageworks will have a day to cancel meetings / tickets and be able to work on projects they want to work on, and demo at the end of the day (“hackathon”), and some of the work sometimes ends up being useful to the company. Remote / distributed work could be a good theme for such an event. | . | SIGGRAPH and ASWF events (Emily) [0:25-0:35] . | SIGGRAPH, DigiPro and Pipeline Conference all going virtual. | DigiPro CFP is due Friday, Pipeline Conference in June. One proposal from OpenColorIO. | Do we keep our content as a full day / 2 days, perhaps adjacent to SIGGRAPH, or do we spread it out over multiple weeks, leading up to SIGGRAPH? . | Daniel: biggest factor for outside US is how to accommodate timezones. | Michael Min: is that an argument for spreading vs grouping? Daniel: people interested in a topic can view the recording before the discussion moves on to the next topic. Simultaneity of discussion vs being able to extend to people in other timezones. | Emily: we can also do a live version, and replay in a different timezone with the presenter available to answer questions. | JT: some events have a Slack channel allowing answering of questions in different timezones. | Emily: Slack integration seems to be a common theme / requirement. | Daniel: how are the other side conferences are handling this? Emily: SIGGRAPH is still trying to figure it out. Eric: DigiPro is also having this conversation internally right now. | Wave: attend Realtime Conference which went virtual. Emily: heard good feedback from that conference. We’re working with them to add an open source panel. | Emily: is Digipro still considering a single day event? Eric: no decision made so far, still possible to try to do it in one day, but awkward due to timezones. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion working group (Emily) [0:35-0:45] . | Tracker of people who want to participate https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kuTEhaq7ECJ4ASqGEFnfM0g_919AjYVzZPcpI_e14yc/edit#gid=0 . | Emily: some candidates on the tracker, please ask colleagues who would be interested. Need to identify a potential chair who would lead the group. | Emily: happy to reach out directly to suggested people. | Emily: finding the right person who already has a strong open source background is difficult. This could serve to introduce people to open source. | Larry: do we have a brief introduction to what we are looking for and what we are trying to accomplish so we can send this to people who might be interested? Emily: can put together such a brief / one slid, but will be up to the D&amp;I group to decide on specific goals, and where they will want to focus. | . | Working Group Updates [0:45-0:50] . | CI Working Group . | Good progress on bringing GPU build agents into production usage for OpenColorIO, which is the targeted first project. Turn prototype into something that delivers value to our projects. | Looking at the other long term goals: cross platform builds, support in a more consistent manner than we have so far, each project has taken different paths so far. | Michael: not much change since last week, but OCIO has fully moved to GitHub Actions, Andy from LF releng working on getting accounts set up with AWS, once that’s in place we can turn the prototype work into a production tool. JF to collaborate with OCIO, goal is to be up and running in 2 weeks at next CI meeting. | . | USD Working Group . | Scheduled meeting in 2 weeks. | Cory: cautiously heading back into the process. We had to put a proposal forward, do we need a TAC vote to accept this? . | Daniel: we need a TAC sponsor, do we need a vote? . | John: do we need a vote because the WG doesn’t exist yet? Don’t recall if the discussions got to that stage yet. | Cory: we’ll try to schedule the meeting for next Wednesday, and come back to the TAC the following week, but want to figure out if there’s an official “hurdle” for the TAC to approve. John: will go back to the process document. David: ASWF is committed to help USD as one of the very important projects in the industry, and wants to help if it can. We want to confirm what are the “goals and non goals”. | Daniel: will confer with Cory and John to clarify what was previously discussed / decided. | . | . | Technical Project updates [0:50-0:55] . | OpenShadingLanguage induction . | Chris: in a bit of a holding pattern, waiting for proposed changes to the CLA by Pixar, most of the other steps have been completed. So waiting for CLA update before proposing “incubation stage”. | Daniel: is this the same issue as for OpenTimelineIO? Larry: yes, same issue, there’s one sentence that may have implications on sibling companies owned by the same corporate parent. Legal folks are talking to each other to try to resolve it. Chris: as a result of this there may be an updated CLA that might trickle down to other projects. Larry: trying to get it right to avoid needing contributors to sign an updated CLA after the fact. | Daniel: are you getting all the support you need from ASWF? Chris: yes, believe so, “the lawyers are talking to the lawyers”. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 20 May 2020 | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Vote on video recording of TAC calls . | Vote was negative, so won’t be recording TAC calls unless we specifically decide to | Some follow up as to whether this extends to TSCs: vote only mentioned TAC meeting for now. The TSCs should have the scope to decide for themselves. So the default position would be no recording, but TSCs can decide otherwise. | Michael: OCIO has never recorded their TSC meetings, will stick with that position. | Cary: OpenEXR hasn’t recorded their TSC meetings either, sometimes wish could playback through discussion when writing notes after the fact, but there is value to discussions being “off the moment”, may affect the tone if you know what you are saying is being recorded. | Nick: OTIO frequently has vendors in attendance, who don’t want to take on fiduciary responsibility to commit to features. | Larry: similar comment, perpetuity of recording has an influence | John: should make sure that TSC meetings aren’t the right place to discuss features of commercial products, want to make sure not to run into antitrust issues | Daniel: so default position for TAC and TSCs is no recording, unless a specific TSC wants to override that | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenEXR . | IMath separation | Cary: Starting with Google Summer of Code intern, set up a weekly check in to touch base. Nature of project is that Owen may “burn through” the project scope fairly quickly, but may also end up running into unforeseen complications. So better to stick to the official timeline with 30hrs/week in early June. | Set up a spreadsheet to break down tasks as a lesson in project management, seems to be going well. | Got another ping yesterday from the Google autofuzz project, which had approached us last year to add OpenEXR to their regular schedule. At the time we had declined due to concern with the volume of potential reports for obscure bugs. This could be construed as us taking a position on security (not taking it seriously)? We may not have the resources to respond to this in a timely way. Security may be less of a concern for many ASWF projects (running behind the firewall). But some projects such as OpenEXR are part of operating systems. | Nick: the 30 day “ticking clock” nature of the system (being put on a “shame list”) would be a problem given project resources. | OpenEXR is part of the macOS ImageIO framework, used throughout the OS. A lot of the early security fixes in OpenEXR were based on internal fuzzing by Apple. | Would this be an “endless trickle” or a “tsunami” of reports? | Gordon: half a person over 1 year for FBX issues that came up when it was included in Windows | Cary: “500 cores for 2 weeks” thrown at EXR: the “obvious” stuff might have already been caught, and those issues were already mostly dealt with. | Larry: how good are they at accepting “won’t fix / false positive”? Cary: 6 issues were submitted last week that were garbled, issue title didn’t match the stack traces. Issue was caused by using an uninstrumented standard library, which turned out to be a false positive. | Daniel: how official is the “won’t fix” process? Nick: Debian had reported a bunch of issues, OpenEXR declined to fix some of those. Cary: what’s to stop the fuzzer from reporting the same issue again? | Gordon: there’s a difference between a true “won’t fix” and “this isn’t a real issue” | Nick: Would still be preferable to have our own approach. As an organization we should have a set of standards we adopt, but not necessarily comfortable with OpenEXR being “out on its own” with regards to Google fuzzer. | Daniel: desire to make this decision carefully that can be generalized across projects, and lack of knowledge about the implications. We could resolve the lack of knowledge issue by signing up OpenEXR, and make it as part of our second stage of CII badge which adds dynamic fuzzing as a requirement. | Cary: will follow up with Google to get more information on the process. | Daniel: perhaps there’s a different service we could use instead. | Cary: these vulnerabilities aren’t just relevant to ASWF and member companies, the issues mostly affect use of OpenEXR outside our community. | Gordon: from a tool provider side, need to worry about security issues even in this space, especially given use in the cloud, and investing quite a bit into security. | Eric: is there written documentation on the IMath split? Cary: general outline sent to the OpenEXR mailing list. Would be worth publishing on the OpenEXR web site. Follow on is a large modernization of the repo (const_expr, CUDA compatibility…) | Daniel: also a useful thread on OpenVDB mailing list about adding Half Float data type to C++ standard | . | OpenColorIO . | Documentation revamp | OpenColorIO-Config-ACES repo: meeting with ACES leadership to clarify relationship between OCIO and ACES, issues of licensing. Started new repo OpenColorIO-Config-ACES under ASWF organization, will work in collaboration with ACES, revamping distribution plan for official OCIO configs. | Will establish WGs for official OCIO configs, also opportunity for studios to contribute configs to leverage infrastructure being put in place. Daniel: interesting model for not-quite-software distribution. License will be the same BSD 3 Clause than OCIO, there’s typically a Python library included to do things like generate LUTs. | Michael: the CI will be dependant on build artifacts, want to make those artifacts available for download. | Michael: two new members to TSC, Carol and Sean working on a documentation revamp for V2, need to revamp the content and structure of the documentation, new website as well. Looking at different solutions, reaching out to community for feedback. Also working with Emily to leverage what can be reused from Linux Foundation. | GPU build project: Andy from releng still working on infrastructure needed on the lf-releng side, organizing AWS account is a bit complicated, but should have something to report at CI meeting next week. | . | OpenShadingLanguage . | adoption process | Still waiting on clarifications about CLA. | Larry: last TSC meeting was almost all about technical instead of administrative issues, which is good progress | . | . | Working groups . | USD . | Group has resumed activity. Cory: had a good meeting with good attendance. Discussed stated goals and non-goals, agreed that they were appropriate. Discussed the deliverables. | USD Working Group GitHub Repository : deliverables, meeting schedule, meeting notes | Daniel: CI working group “spontaneously” created, the USD WG is the first one with a somewhat more formal process. Process was inherited from CNCF, TAC should vote on endorsing the USD working group. Daniel: proposal for WG was merged into TAC repo. | Working Group Process Document including endorsement by the TAC | Daniel: it may be a bit hurried to vote on this TAC meeting? Otherwise we’ll do a vote by email to keep things moving. | Cory: will start doing the announcements on the USD interest mailing list to reach out to a wider audience. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Emily working on identifying the right people to move | Carol Payne from Netflix and Rachel Rose from ILM will co-chair, had a call last week to discuss plans | Will make official proposal to the TAC soon, discuss specifics like term limits, TSC structure… | Send overview document to the TAC | . | Python 3 . | Henry Vera from DNeg brought Ashley Whetter onto the call, leading internal Python 3 effort at DNeg. | Next step will be to have a small number of formation meetings to determine goals / non goals and come back to TAC with proposal | Daniel started the process going, handing off to Henry and Ashley | . | . | ASWF fund, grants . | Looking to establish a presence in the Linux Foundation Community Bridge system to identify projects of interest to our community and potentially grant funds to support those projects. | Can we identify projects where funding would help with development? | Could the original VES Tech Committee document identifying OSS projects in VFX be used as a source? | Daniel: typically an existing project will identify a need for a key developer, and use Community Bridge to seek support for that developer. Second approach would be more open ended, for instance articulating needs for remote review, and seeing whether this mechanism could be used to get to a solution. | Is this similar to the “Google Summer of Code”? Could we look at funding some of the students ourselves? | Daniel: does the TAC think this is a valid mechanism for the goals of the TAC / ASWF, and also look at the at the specifics. | John: can share experience from other foundations. Somewhat wider scope than GSoC, lots of models of how it could be used. David had talked about establishing a fund / grant program, but there are other options as well. | Daniel: we probably need more time / offline discussion, will work with John to work out specific examples. | . | Vote on USD working group . | JF is moving to endorse USD WG | Daniel seconds | All Yeah, no abstain or reject | Adopted unanimously, first officially endorsed WG | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting: 3 June 2020 | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | ASWF Grants and Fund . | Project areas? | . | Events (Emily) . | SIGGRAPH . | Moving to mid-August, no set date yet. | . | Open Source Day / Week . | ASWF Open Source Day will be a 2 day event, were going to do it Thu-Fri before SIGGRAPH, but now TBD . | Reached out to Digipro (Saturday?) and Pipeline Conference (Sunday?) to coordinate . | Every project to give updates, inviting outside projects such as Res, MaterialX, USD . | Inviting studio execs to discuss how the projects are used . | Use cases / production examples, keep interesting / more visual . | Updates are going to be 30 minutes only (because of virtual attendance) . | Working on platform, Zoom based, meeting form vs webinar form. Talking to Real Time Conference as well to see how they are doing things. | Looking at a ASWF BoF followed by a TAC BoF during SIGGRAPH itself. | Talk on OCIO submitted and accepted to Digipro . | Pipeline Conference CFP is due this Friday (5-June-2020) if anyone wants to propose something. | Putting together a brief organizer template / guideline for the project updates, not prescriptive but can be useful. | . | . | Working Groups . | Branching out on multiple fronts . | CI Working Group (Daniel) . | CI working group getting into mechanics of provisioning GPU runners, relies on the LF release engineering group . | Starting to look at Mac and Windows build problems, in particular . | New VFX Reference Platform aswf-docker Docker containers . | RedHat Developer Toolset 9, discovered bug (compiler crash) in gcc 9, fixed in gcc 9.3.1, waiting for official build for CentOS (important for OSL) . | Looks promising, will support C++ 17 . | Validates the approach of using Docker images in our infrastructure to test upcoming versions of the VFX Reference Platform. | New containers also have clang 10 and llvm 10, useful for testing. | Michael: heard from Andy at LF releng that the open issue for GPU builders is getting resolved. | Windows / Mac: good opportunity for someone with expertise in those areas to get involved in the CI working group. | Wave: someone in developer relations who is familiar with CI systems has volunteered to get involved, will have time after Apple Developer Conference . | . | USD Working Group (Cory) . | Suggestions for initiatives: . | A public Wiki to share best practices, how to structure assets . | Started discussion to John to look at how contributions could look like. | Full suite of USD tests running in GitHub, what it would it take to transition test suites currently running in Azure Pipelines, would use GPU instances . | NVIDIA reaching out to see how they could help with lack of good image diffing tools . | . | Meet again next week . | Michael Min: some members had concerns of how to work with Pixar to get approval for all contributions. Will the WG always be gated by Pixar? Having to get approval for everything would limit the usefulness. | Cory: the WG is trying to help the Pixar USD team, so it’s important to keep the USD Team in the loop to make sure that initiatives are helpful. But don’t expect that every activity of the WG has to be approved by USD team. But wanted to make sure any WG initiatives aren’t “competing” with work being done or scheduled by USD team. | . | Python 3 Working Group . | Doodle poll for WG meeting time | . | D&amp;I Working Group . | Emily: should have formal submission in a week | . | . | Project Updates . | OpenEXR . | Fuzz testing . | Carey: had TSC meeting two week ago, invited two representatives from OSS-Fuzz project to join and discuss the service. Their presence was very helpful, put a lot of fears to rest. | OpenEXR agreed to sign up, one hour of work to do. Low key process. | OpenEXR has already had a lot of fuzzing testing, don’t expect a torrent of new reports. Bugs get reported privately, have 90 days to fix them before public notification, which looks doable. | Assumption is that reported bugs are easily reproduced with test cases / datasets. | Going from test case to fix has typically been pretty simple: integer overflow for instance, just needs a change of type. So doesn’t feel like we are signing up for a large amount of work. | Kimball: as we get more of a corpus of test cases, we probably need a regression test repository of problematic images. | Large repo of binary files, could be a separate section of the openexr-images repo, or a separate repo? There are already some “garbage images” in the openexr-images repo which should be integrated in the test suite. | Daniel: Openexr-images repo is still a separate repo, is it a sub repo? Carey: currently completely separate, have been intending to revamping it. Has not been moved into ASWF GitHub organization, still under the openexr organization, which needs to be closed. | Carey: got a report of a couple of bugs from someone at a security lab in Beijing, reporting a vulnerability. There was a test case, reproduced and fixed it. The reporter requested that OpenEXR requests a CVE so it can be tracked. But it sounds like this is an organization that may be looking for bug bounties, brings up the question of previous instances of people reporting bugs and filing CVEs. But first time someone has requested we file one ourselves. Wrote a summary and reached out to Dan Hutchinson at The Foundry (who had presented on security a year ago). Gordon: Autodesk has internal security team, has had to file CVEs, had issues reported against Maya and FBX. Can ask Autodesk team for an opinion / review. Carey: asking for confirmation that this is the right way to go about it. Gordon: Microsoft has filed a few CVEs against FBX (they do a lot of testing), then asked Autodesk to create them. CVE likes specific language in reports. Carey: will write to Autodesk team. | Owen Thomson, GSoC intern, first day of full time work was Monday. | . | OpenShadingLanguage Adoption . | Chris: no update, still in holding pattern. | Larry: upcoming governing board / legal subcommittee meeting where this is supposed to be discussed, hoping for an agreement on the CLA language. | John: some language issues were raised by Disney legal counsel with the CLA used by most of our projects (except OpenCue which uses the Apache CLA). Bringing concerns to legal committee (next week), will discuss and come up with a recommendation. This may result in requests to each TSC / TSC chairs to potentially amend terms of CLA. Is a change to CLA retroactive? Depends on the nature of the change to the CLA. | Larry: we didn’t make contributors to projects before joining the ASWF sign a new CLA for old contributions. John: yes, this is not (typically) retroactive. | . | OpenCue Incubation Status . | Daniel: according to our project lifecycle process, supposed to have annual review of projects in incubation, discuss and review progress. So good idea to have a conversation on this topic. | Brian: OpenCue has been making progress on this, discussed this on last TSC meeting which was joined by John. A few months ago identified some issues, in particular diversity and static analysis. Some progress on diversity, but not much progress on static analysis, have been focussing more on test coverage aspect rather than issues reported by static analysis tool. Should have more to report at next TAC meeting. | . | . | Qt licensing changes . | Gordon: Maya is currently trying to navigate changes the Qt Company are making to their licensing. Removing Long Term Support from their open source offering. Historically Maya has used the open source version, studios have dependencies for their own in-house tools. Pinged the VFX Reference Platform team, no announcement / decision on this topic. Maya will have to make a difference sooner rather than later: should Maya move to commercial version, or stick with open source version. | Should we collectively decide what to do: stick to open source version with no long term maintenance, maintain our own branch? . | Henry: started looking at options internally after discussion with Autodesk. A lot of internal software based on Qt. Decent sized R&amp;D team that would require commercial licenses. No decision yet, but leaning towards open source version. Most facilities are using Qt for their internal software in one way or another. | Daniel: Qt is open source but the repository is not very open to contributions. So even if you want to fix a bug, it’s not clear if the fix will be accepted back to the main branch, so maintaining an open source branch would be a fork. | Gordon: Maya has been trying to move back to a “vanilla” version of Qt, had been making good progress feeding fixes back to main repo. Complicated discussions because of different ownership structure between the commercial and open source versions. We need a series of possible approaches to deal with this. Perhaps if the industry is leaning away from their version, that might have an influence on the Qt Company? . | Gordon: Autodesk does have a commercial license for some of the components such as the installer. Autodesk will have to make decision sooner than the larger group. | Sean: should we start a group dedicated to this topic? Gordon: would be interested, are there enough people interested? . | Nick: on the USD project, spend some time to help people who try to integrate Qt work into USD, may no longer accept these contributions if the Qt / PyQt license becomes too complex. | Gordon: agreed, preference for open source version. | Kimball: we probably shouldn’t worry about support, we don’t apply that criteria to other open source components we use. | Nick: definitely prefer to have a single version of Qt / PyQt to support. | Daniel: Autodesk and SideFX were maintaining patches against Qt for a long time to fix certain issues, for instance Wacom support, where changes weren’t being accepted back into the main repo. Want to be able to share the exact source that Maya is building against, and make sure to stick to the license. Keen to be on a common version. | Henry: facilities pushed Maya to try to adopt vanilla version of Qt . | Kimball: VFX Reference Platform specified patches against Qt in previous years . | Daniel: haven’t looked yet at the reaction of the KDE community, which is the main user of Qt. | Daniel: do we agree that the open source version remains the preferred version? Should we have the discussion just within the TAC, or with a wider audience? Happy to lead that discussion. | John: is the discussion more on the legal/business or developer side? Gordon: legal / business side. | John: LF happy to help within limits of its mandate. | Larry: not clear about “compatibility” issues. If commercial products selected the commercial version, would it create a compatibility gap between those who have a commercial license and those who don’t? . | Gordon: 1 year of support gets mostly burned away just by transition to new version. API changes (headers) would not be able to be redistributed, and can’t get security fixes. | John: any of our current projects directly impacted? Larry: OSL uses Qt but just for a small thing. Brian: all GUI components written with PySide, same for OTIO. Also we include Qt in our Docker images (aswf-docker project). | Daniel: we can discuss on the TAC mailing list what are the next steps. | . | Next meeting . | 17 June 2020 | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Streamlined Slack self-invite workflow: ASWF Slack Login . | New member welcome: Sean O’Connell (AMD) . | On the software performance engineering team . | Optimize ISV benchmarks and applications for all server and desktop CPUs . | . | OpenCue Incubation review . | Process reference: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/master/process/lifecycle.md . | Checklist on how the project is developing . | Is the graduation imminent or still hurdles to overcome . | How can we help the project along if needed . | Brian: getting close to going for graduation, everything looking good, probably need another couple of months to complete the CII requirements. | Daniel: the question of accurately gauging project usage in the community can be tricky. | Brian: it’s a question that’s applicable to all Open Source projects, Google is used to having detailed telemetry / information on user base, but we don’t have that in OpenCue, and haven’t found a good way to get this information without hitting privacy issues. Other ASWF projects haven’t had to deal with this so much since they are clear industry standards. | JT: Pasadena Open Source is planning to keep OpenCue as part of the promoted software stack, including all ASWF projects. Planning a press release, have exposure with close association with the Blender project. | Larry: in the process of switching over from internal predecessor (cue3) at SPI . | Daniel: Does anyone have expertise on how to deal with open source user base information gathering? Larry: open source authors are always somewhat guessing, “begging” for feedback. Sometimes hear through the grapevine, sometimes through industry article (FXGuide). But most info is by luck, probably under counting. John: also should figure out goals, users vs studios. Some projects will enable a way for companies to opt-in to a way to state that a company is a user. Example from one of the CNCF projects, Envoyproxy. they collect a data file that companies can opt in (added as a commit). Often you need to get some kind of legal review. | Brian: sounds like something that could be easy / low overhead to put in place. | Daniel: a ASWF-level survey could also yield useful information. | Brian: will present data at the next meeting gathered from OpenCue public channels. | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenShadingLanguage adoption . | Legal Committee meeting . | Chris: seems like things are pointing back to Apache CLA, which is where things originally started at. Lawyers are currently re-reviewing that CLA. Hopefully will have positive info to report at next TAC meeting. | John: this could possibly have impact on all ASWF projects. | Larry: do we have any confidence that the next company that has large contributions to make won’t also ask for major revisions? How can we be confident that “we’ve got this nailed”? . | John: these things are never completely bullet proof, as case law evolves things change over time in OSS, trying to follow best practices. High desire to achieve this result of a framework acceptable to all / most companies. | Daniel: we have been trying to take steps towards the more standard and broadly used licenses, processes and terms, and encourage our member companies and contributors to accept those rather than require custom terms. | . | OpenEXR / IlmBase / Math Library . | Cary: new repos are setup, code ported over and building. | Set up GitHub project and issues to host discussion, strategies about modernizing exception handling . | Daniel: very good discussion on ways to make use of various recent C++ features, but still try to minimize / prevent API changes. | Cary: the more disruptive the changes, the more carefully they need to be vetted. “Anything” is on the table, but disruption to existing code requires strong arguments in favor. | Kimball: cleaning up the OpenEXR repo itself will lead to questions to the group about how they deal with their dependencies. | Cary: Owen is working out great, he’s a great asset. | Larry: would like to hear feedback from other projects on GSoC interns. | Cary: 30 min checking once a week, same for Kimball, plus TSC weekly meeting, and daily email contact, so good engagement. | Daniel: towards the end we may want to review the process. Cary: we have to file a progress report end of June and July, payment is contingent on that. Will share info on what is required of this report. | . | OpenTimelineIO: great start, got close to the finish line, following the proposed schedule. | OpenCue: also good progress, aligning with the schedule, looking great so far. | OpenColorIO . | Moving towards V2 release . | Michael: spun up 2 WGs, one to redo documentation / website, and creating a standard ACES / OCIO config. | Successful, involvement from new contributors, weekly or bi-weekly meetings. | . | . | Working Groups . | Process: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/master/process/working_groups.md . | CI . | No meeting since last TAC call . | Progress on getting AWS / GPU builds. | Michael: OCIO will work on this next week . | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Rachel Rose (ILM), first D&amp;I meeting just before this one. | Not a lot to report yet after first meeting, great turnout with 39 attendees, with good diversity. | First half of meeting was self introductions, what people were looking for. Many newcomers to these activities or ASWF itself. | Second half was brainstorming as to what the group is hoping to accomplish. Engage with college-level students, as well as younger children interested in Open Source. | Many conversations around education, skills for negotiation and promotions, rise in the ranks of industry. | Discussions around codes of conduct. | We should be doing more things like Summer of Code to pull in a wider group of people, giving them projects to work on. | Hoping for a second meeting next week or the week after to establish concrete goals. Will send out survey to determine next date. | Emily: large desire for mentorship, asking project TSCs to identify what students could work on, both code and documentation, will be useful when ASWF launches mentorship program. | Template to be shared with TAC, vote to endorse the WG . | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: kickoff meeting, set up GitHub repo and mailing list. | Discussing the direction the group wants to follow and “mission statement”. Information sharing to help the transition to Python 3, reducing risk as well as specific technical processes. | Looking for a TAC member sponsor (Daniel: voting member of the TAC who can endorse / propose the working group, doesn’t necessarily have to be the chair of the WG, Daniel happy to be that person). | Looking to get more (DCC) vendor representation within the group. | Proposed WG statement . | Daniel: are we ready to vote on the endorsement of the WG? . | Daniel sponsors, Kimball proposes, seconded by Henry. No opposes or abstain, unanimous, Python 3 WG is endorsed. | Daniel: will reach out to DCC vendors to invite representation to the WG. | . | USD . | Cory: had a really good meeting, well attended, a bunch of pre-work was done to identify categories for knowledge base. Spent most of the session reviewing those. Well underway, trying to materialize into GitHub Wiki. Comments that GitHub Wiki may quickly become a bottleneck, and Confluence may be a better platform, will reach out to John to see if that’s possible. | Didn’t spend time on the USD CI yet, will spend more time on that once the documentation infrastructure is in place . | Next meeting on Wednesday . | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Open Source Day - Emily . | SIGGRAPH is likely to be last week of August, so we are targeting August 12-13 2020. | Using Zoom platform, similar lineup to last year, sessions around 30 minutes, 7AM to 2PM Pacific (not great for Australia). | MaterialX, ACES, as well as ASWF projects . | Use case presentations from studios . | Can present talks about specific use of projects in production . | Will start working on formalizing format . | Save the date! . | Daniel: what about Beers of a Feather? Is there any way we can encourage informal discussions? . | Emily: there is crossover with the D&amp;I WG on how to encourage involvement / contribution. | Larry: would be great if some of the new contributors in D&amp;I WG could participate to Open Source Day . | Wave: documents on “how to get involved” can be really useful. Larry: we should have ready answers available for “how do I get involved” . | Wave: does LF have any such resources from its other projects / foundations? Can be as trivial as “How to I make my first PR?”. Emily: should be able to find something across the LF. | Larry: as part of GSoC proposal, every project identified good issues to start with. | Rachel: D&amp;I group could be a good place to collate / prioritize this info . | Wave: not only developers can be mentors . | Daniel: is new documentation for OCIO able to bring in a wider range of contributors? Michael: trying to approach from perspective of not just writing the documentation for developers, but also integrators, artists, TDs… Documentation goes from “shallow” to “deep”, targeting different types of users. Also trying to set up documentation to argue for a wider base of contributors. | Emily: LF has Confluence, what else? John: projects go in many different directions for documentation. Some incorporate it close to the code. Andy working on spinning up a Confluence server. | John: LF course on contributing to Open Source . | John: some LF projects go down the path of building a training course, sometimes using the EdX platform. Doesn’t take the place of actual documentation, but can be worth exploring to broaden the user base / engagement. | Emily: k8s has good info on maintaining documentation . | Michael: notes on OCIO documentation WG is in the repo . | Emily: we need to set D&amp;I goals for the TAC so we can measure against those goals and measure progress. | Daniel: there is a mailing list and Slack channel . | . | VFX Platform (Larry) . | The VFX Platform just published its 2021 Draft specifications. Highlight #1 is that it’s moving to gcc 9.3 and C++17 (and, as we already knew, Python 3.7) – so let that be warning to projects to start preparing, as well as getting these cases into their CI. Highlight #2 is that they named OCIO v2.0 and OpenEXR 3.0 for 2021, despite the fact that both are still in progress and not released yet (how’s that for lighting a fire under them?). | Nick: To be clear this is just the Draft for next year so please send feedback if you would prefer a different version for anything. We have around 4-6 weeks before we start locking in versions so we have a final target everyone can work towards. We are actively considering changing Python to 3.8 so please shout if you have opinions… | . | Next meeting . | 1 July 2020 | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | OpenCue Incubation Review (Brian) . | Much development work last year . | Windows Support, Python 3 . | CI system merged into ASWF infrastructure, soon to be GitHub Actions . | Small work: bug fixes, stability fixes, successful effort, closed 193 GitHub Issues, a lot of this work related to getting OpenCue ready for Open Source . | Good growth in engagement in all channels . | Stats from GitHub, users lists: 499 GitHub stars, 148 members on user list, around 100 people on developer list . | Contributions to CI eg Docker Images . | 50% Java / 50% Python . | Multi-component enduser app, including GUI . | Helps to push ASWF in different directions than other projects (typically C++ based) . | Goals for next year: . | ASWF Graduation: would like to get guidance from TAC on priority of CII badge completion / graduation instead of feature work . | Cloud compatibility (GSoC) . | Users/Permissions system . | Packaging and distribution . | . | Graduation progress: . | 5 committers from 4 different companies . | 25 contributors . | 83% complete CII badge . | Prioritized feature work and test coverage . | Static analysis still to be done . | Other checklist items complete . | . | Joshua: did you run into any issues transitioning from your own GitHub organization to ASWF org? Brian: went pretty smoothly, had to figure out CLA system, it’s been stable over last few months. The project was fairly new to GitHub in the first place, so no deep legacy of existing integrations with original organization. Joshua: some projects had “gaps” with key contributors no longer covered by CLA? Brian: yes, some contributors had to fill out new CLA again. | Daniel: can you identify any of the bigger challenges / stumbling blocks that could be improved for other projects? Brian: technical aspects went pretty well, did have to spend time to set up CI system, project with template project really helped and will help in the future. Biggest obstacles are non technical: integrating new contributors, growing the community. | Brian: there is overlap between bug fixing and CII badge, but competition for resources with important features like Windows and Python 3. Lots of work to deal with all static analysis reports, many false positives that take a lot of time to deal with. Some issues are simple and could be “good first issues”, some issues about database interaction are subtle and need deeper knowledge. | Daniel: what are the crucial areas where the projects could use greater support from ASWF or the community? Brian: some technical areas are missing coverage due to original authors not being around anymore. For instance some deeper database expertise could be useful. But overall growing community / engagement / non-technical issues are probably more important. Have been tracking GitHub and email, but hard to identify exactly what is the user base. It would help to have hard data on engagement to report back to corporate sponsors. | Vote on OpenCue status. Daniel: move to vote to extend incubation phase for 6 months. Seconded by Kimball. 6 months would be to consider moving from Incubation to Adopted status, give them more time to get ready for graduation. Michael Min: would community engagement also be a factor in further review in 6 months? Daniel: same criteria would be considered in 6 months. Brian: intent is to move for graduation before 6 months. | All ayes, no oppose or abstain, motion passes, 6 month extension to Incubation status for OpenCue. | . | Open Source Day, SIGGRAPH (Emily) . | Discussion on TAC mailing list. | What to do about Open Source Day vs DigiPro . | Most projects are still interested to have a 1hr BoF . | Do we keep it the same week as DigiPro or move it? Are people blocking out their day for DigiPro? Will people be taking a whole day? . | Kimball: more concerned about timezone . | Emily: trying to figure better support for timezones: pre-record sessions + live Q&amp;A for instance. | Kimball: BoF discussions are usually the best part, but of course no perfect solution . | Emily: as per Larry said, at lot of discussions already happening via TSC, mailing lists, Slack. | Kimball: at OpenEXR BoF last year, we had a number of attendees who are not involved in traditional channels, but someone who has a free hour at SIGGRAPH would just drop by. | Larry: argument for still having the BoFs while we have a conference. If someone won’t join a video TSC meeting, will they join a video BoF? . | Daniel: our TSC meetings assume a lot of context, a BoF targets a larger audience. | Wave: lots of coworkers are interested in specific projects, value is the snapshot of the current state of the project, what they want to share, and what is their roadmap. Can point coworkers to specific events. A BoF can be a good “summing up point” where the video can be valid for a few months afterwards. Project contributors can make themselves available via Slack. | Larry: forcing ourselves to do BoFs in a concentrated time may be bad for attendees? Emily: Open Source Days provide a good opportunity to present the progress of the foundation and all our projects, important to show progress from all projects. | Wave: agree with Larry to avoid DigiPro. People at work have little control over their schedule unless they are travelling, and no one is travelling right now. | Wave: a lot of people will be watching on one screen, while working on another screen (example of WWDC). | Emily: could move to the week after DigiPro (SIGGRAPH “on demand content” week). Larry / Daniel: that does seem like a good option. | Emily: planning to use Zoom webinars, presenters will be able to see attendees, but attendees won’t be able to see each other unless they are using chat. We can potentially do it in the Zoom meeting format (potential security issues). There are other platforms as well, but Zoom is well understood. | There will be a separate Slack channel. | Michael Min: helps to have a dedicated moderator, is that possible with Zoom? . | Emily: Real Time Conference is using Zoom webinars, and designate someone to be moderator. | Emily: look to doing a full day the week before SIGGRAPH, 1 hr BoF sessions. | . | ASWF Fund and Grants . | Remote review tool? . | Daniel: revisit presentation from David Morin . | DIscussion has gone quiet on TAC, anything in the TSCs? . | John: the Governing Board had a strong desire to see if there are ways to use some of the funding available in the ASWF to see if there are opportunities to accelerate not only project development, but also help with D&amp;I. The Governing Board sees a huge need for improving D&amp;I in the industry, lead to WG which has made a lot of progress. But also is there an avenue to help the existing projects, or projects outside the foundation looking to move in. LF has seen projects use a grant structure to do very targeted development, or targeted services such as documentation or infrastructure. Also a path for a mentorship route. The TSCs / TSC chairs often think about “how do we get the next group of people to join / contribute” (example of Larry leading the GSoC initiative). | Rachel: from D&amp;I WG, sent out survey and got really good responses, going over results and will have next meeting soon. Being able to set up some sort of mentorship program, with an eye towards contributing to existing ASWF projects. A lot of work remains to be done. | John: a lot of concepts around net new projects that could be started within ASWF. Until now the ASWF has been bringing in existing projects and helping with sustainability. But now we should be looking at gaps in the open source offerings. Conversations around asset management, and specifically around gathering and distributing assets that can be used for testing. This is tricky due to copyright issues. | Michael Min: there is some ambiguity as to how funds are allocated, and how do engineers from contributing companies are used. How would these funds / grants be used? What does it mean to get a “grant” if you are already staff at a contributing company? . | Daniel: it is up to TAC and Governing Board to define what is appropriate. LF has offered the Community Bridge framework as a model of how to do this. A transparent mechanism, can look at how other open source projects / foundations have used their funds. | Kimball: as an individual corporate, cannot match what GSoC can do, but as a group we could make a difference . | Larry: we could afford the funds that GSoC spends on our 3 students ($6K per student). We could definitely do something similar, with an eye towards D&amp;I for instance. | Kimball: could use this to bootstrap new projects / communities, and reach out to film schools for instance. Larry: could be more targeted effort. | Wave: we talked about assets / test footage, could offer a grant to a film school to generate material, go shoot some footage, generate some models… . | Daniel: will create Action Item for TSC leads and WGs to come up with proposals for the next TAC meeting. If we wanted to look at a remote review tool as a specific project, what would we do to move ahead with something like that. | John: WG structure is probably the most practical structure available for this, might be quickest way forward. Some foundations have concept of a “Lab” or “Sandbox” which could be parallels, but these could be the result of a WG. An incubation project may not need funding to succeed, it may be overkill, whereas a more mature, graduated project may be able to make use of a specific grant to address a specific need. | . | Technical Project updates . | Working Groups . | CI . | Formalize WG status Draft charter README.md . | #wg-ci Slack channel is now open . | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Python 3 . | USD . | Cory: short meeting last wednesday, picked up a few Action Items from previous meetings. Knowledge Base Wiki, waiting for Confluence being deployed by LF. | John: just got that live today. Cory: will get some content in there. | PR from Aloys to move some CI workflows to GitHub Actions, team is busy with a current release. | Next meeting on Wednesday next week. | . | . | Summer of Code Review (Larry) . | Larry: this coming week is when the first set of student evaluations are due, first payment to students gets unlocked based on passing reviews. 2 submitted so far, and are highly positive, except third one to be as well. | Very positive results . | Another review due a bit later . | . | Next meeting . | 15 July 2020 | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Conference updates . | Emily: 19-20 August for Open Source Days . | All projects have option of 25min or 55min session, most are going with 55min . | Start at 9AM PDT, will determine how late in the day we will go based on number of projects. | Will ask projects for preferences of time slot to accommodate other timezones, to avoid repeat / recorded sessions as much as possible . | Working on speaker limit on Zoom webinars (originally limit of 3) . | Requested that each project try to be as diverse as possible in their speakers, even if it means inviting someone from outside TSC to present an update . | Website will be up this week, banner ad in SIGGRAPH mailing . | Commitments from ACES, VFX Reference Platform, Rez is a maybe, chasing down MaterialX, USD a maybe, MeshRoom/AliceVision. Alembic? . | Daniel: usually BOFs have physical attendance, you need conference registration of some sort to have access. But what if open source projects are trying to engage people with as few restrictions as possible. Some projects maybe want to have BOFs with SIGGRAPH rather than Open Source days. | SIGGRAPH requires $200 registration fee to be able to attend BOFs in their scope. | ASWF Open Source Days will be free event. | Want to cater also to brand new attendees without background in our projects. | Daniel: (some of) our WGs may want to do a BOF as well, use this an opportunity to welcome new contributors, lay out roadmap, identify opportunities for contribution / areas of need. | Emily: these could be shorter 25min session, could bundle USD WG with a potential USD BOF . | Emily: had discussions with outreach committee about swag: perhaps we could offer opportunity to donate to nonprofit instead. How can we better line up with our D&amp;I mission / effort? Or we could have a swag store tha benefits D&amp;I initiatives. Want to minimize shipping costs. | . | Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) - John . | Number of projects have been using LF shortform CLA with success . | Some newer projects from Disney entities have had questions from Disney legal around some of the terms of these agreements, brought about meeting of legal committee a couple of months ago. | General consensus: need to get as consistent a CLA template as possible, and because Apache CLA more widely used in the industry than LF Short Form CLA, we should converge on Apache CLA. Heard back from Disney legal that this is OK with them, should help with OpenShadingLanguage and OpenTimelineIO to migrate to ASWF repo. | How does this impact things going forward? How should projects think about this? . | Projects are not required to use the CLA contribution framework. Projects don’t need to change their charter. Process of charging the charter is entirely project dependent. TSCs for new projects should decide how they want to proceed, LF (Steve Winslow) is happy to assist and answer questions, work with legal teams to answer questions. | Existing projects do not have to make any changes, no need to change existing CLA process. Would recommend to TSC chairs that if there have been community concerns because of CLA terms, should have discussion in the community to consider the Apache CLA. But that’s not a requirement. | Larry: can a project have more than one CLA to select from? John: that’s typically not a good idea. But projects that came into the ASWF with an existing CLA and picked a different one going forward, no need for older contributors to go back and resign a new CLA. | Larry: for projects that haven’t established CLA, is the Apache CLA “officially” what we should go forward with? John: should be able to go now (standard Apache CLA). Larry: the Apache CLA mentions the Apache license, but some of our projects don’t use the Apache license. Would be great to have a “blessed” version. John: there should be a complete disconnect vs the Apache CCLA / ICLA, and the desire of the legal committee is to use these CLAs in original form. | Daniel: let’s submit PRs to the tac and aswf-sample-project repos. John: legal committee is not there to mandate anything to the TAC but to make recommendations. Daniel: worth having a discussion at TAC level to gauge appetite for changing CLA of existing projects, or just going forward with new ones. | Nick: does this mean that Disney employees are unblocked to contribute to ASWF projects? John: Disney to provide guidance, providing an Apache CCLA. | Joshua: we can use the template project to test the end-to-end process, instead of doing this on a “live” project. There may be unknown blockers until we’ve actually done it. John: would need to work with Steve (LF legal) to figure out how that would be done. | John: try to get all major contributing organizations to sign the CCLA before transitioning a project. But there is overhead to adding CCLA to a project. | Kimball: would it not be possible to do an umbrella CCLA for every ASWF project? John: some issues with projects under different licenses, don’t know if moving to the Apache CCLA resolves that issue or not. But every project wold need to align to the same CCLA, could be a sticking point. But worth discussing. Kimball: would also help people to contribute to any ASWF projects without having to consult with corporate legal team. John: desire from everyone is to make it as simple as possible. | Michael: not opposed to switching CLAs, but currently too busy to do right now. Larry: would be a switch back to CLA that OCIO had before joining ASWF. | Daniel: are there techniques to help with transition? John: “cold turkey” is the best approach once a project has decided to switch. Can have a grace period around cutover to help. Having 2 CLAs active at same time is usually a problematic practice. | OpenCue has Apache CLA, OpenVDB, OpenColorIO, OpenEXR have LF shortform, OpenTimelineIO and OpenShadingLanguage are stuck in “CLA purgatory” but now have a way forward. | Daniel: next step to reach out to project TSCs, would be preferable to try to move every project to a compatible (Apache) CLA. | . | Working Groups . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Rachel: since last TAC meeting, sent out survey to WG member, gathered useful info, will meet every 4 weeks, will use Google Drive, gathered thoughts and opinions on what goals will be. | Drafted goals document: . | Encourage high school and college students to contribute to M&amp;E-related open source projects (external facing goals) . | Ensure that ASWF has diverse leadership across foundation and projects . | Better education internally at companies . | . | Discussed initiatives under each of these 3 goals. | First step is to put together D&amp;I blog posts for ASWF web site, can be done quickly! . | Emily: updates to web site with links to project, pulled some intro courses from LF web site . | Rachel: should be ready to officially submit WG charter to TAC very soon . | Emily: need to figure out best communication channels with each project . | Meetings are second wednesday of each month. Sub initiatives can have meetings on off weeks. | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: working on deliverables document . | Progress a bit slow, found that groups that are turning up aren’t very far (if at all) into Python 3 transition, so more looking for guidance than offer guidance . | Autodesk representative at last meeting which was good, having issues getting representation from vendors. | Daniel / Emily will help reach out to vendors . | Daniel: do we have representation from ASWF projects? We haven’t done a checkin across the projects. | Ashley: hasn’t really been discussed as a topic. So far no one has pointed to an ASWF project as a Python 3 blocker . | Stable cadence: every two weeks, alternating between earlier and later in the day Vancouver time to accommodate timezones . | . | USD . | Some practical issues with Wiki contributions that need to be worked out | . | CI . | For projects interested in porting to Apple Silicon, contact drwave@apple.com if you want remote access to the Apple Developer Transition Kit at MacStadium. | Larry: any updates on GitHub Actions supporting Apple Silicon for CI builds? Wave: someone from Apple will be at next CI meeting and should be able to answer that. Shouldn’t be a problem. | Porting projects to Apple Silicon should make them able to run on iOS / iPadOS . | Andrew / Michael: initial GPU build of OCIO on AWS CodeBuilder fired off, initially failed but should be working soon. Remaining issues with not being able to have access to secrets to build from PRs. | Michael: won’t necessary be able to run test suite on PRs before merge. Andrew: would need a development branch where you accept PRs to run testing, then merge from dev branch to main branch. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | Larry / Kris: excited about the CLA blocker being resolved . | OCIO / Michael: issues with first time contributors not reading contribution documentation first, looking to install some pre-PR hooks to help with that . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 29 July 2020 | . | .

Daniel: how long are other sessions? Emily: 25 or 55 minutes, D&amp;I will be 55 minutes since includes a panel, other groups are 25 or 55. Daniel: will depend on how deep into the details we want to go, but 25 minutes is likely sufficient. Emily: Python3 group doesn’t have enough content, but could include an update in the CI session? For SIGGRAPH, submitting a ASWF overview, and a BoF as a “whirlwind tour” of ASWF project, 10 minute update from each project. | Also does USD working group want to present, reached out to Cory . | Can make many different presenters, so easier to include as presenter people who are likely to answer questions during Q&amp;A session, easier to do up front rather than switch from attendee to presenter during Q&amp;A. | Linux Foundation events team and Emily / John will be on during sessions to help. Each Zoom session will have its own link but same password. | Open Source Days registration site is up . | Registration will be required, email will go out with a password a day or two before the event. | Graphics will be provided so anyone else wants to “advertize” the event . | . | Working Groups . | CI . | Daniel: focussing on marching forward with GPU / CI setup using AWS CodeBuilder, moving along, Michael Dolan can update. | Also started to go deeper into Mac platform support, Wave put us in touch with Marshall Elfstrand from Apple Developer Relations team who will contribute going forward. | Doug Walker: progress on GPU CI is going forward. Andy: logs are now working, being forwarded from AWS CodeBuilder back to GHA. Still getting a failure saying there’s no “head attached” to the builder. Looks like the correct NVIDIA drivers may not be installed? https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/projects/IT/queues/custom/18/IT-19573 Sean Looper can help find the right person at AWS if we need help. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: update is short. Met with ASWF Board to present an update, slides + survey that happened a month or so ago, and first draft of goals and deliverables. Next meeting planned for Open Source Days, second draft of charter for the group. | Emily: will have a session at Open Source Days, and other events planned as well. | Brief showing of the slides . | Survey Results: many respondents from several studios (30 responses). | Asking about familiarity with open source, what age group / experience level should be targeted (college &amp; university age was majority response) . | Asking about what programs would have most impact: mentorships and partnerships with other organizations . | Draft goals: encourage high school and college students to pursue career in or participate in open source projects, ensure ASWF has diverse leadership and membership, provide guidance and resource to ASWF members . | Student education is an external goal: develop a mentorship program . | Diversity in ASWF: work with TAC and Board to establish internal D&amp;I goals, work with ASWF projects to in place a D&amp;I ambassador to ensure projects are inviting to newcomers of all backgrounds . | Guidance to member: blog posts on D&amp;I for members, gather D&amp;I resources for members . | Poll: looking for ideas on how to target universities . | Poll: looking for ideas on partner organizations . | Would like to develop a model for these programs that could be repeatable across other universities and organizations . | Should also target universities / organizations with which we have established, personal relationships . | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: good meeting this week. How to get people more motivated about the transition. The need to transition to Python 3 is often seen as a chore, so coming up with a list of pros and cons to help convince studios that it is a good idea. | Will start thinking about how the VFX industry will connect more with the Python community. We have custom solutions which may be better served by general purpose solutions from the greater community. Daniel: packaging and distribution approaches, or anything else? Ashley: best practices, using PyLint, Black for formatting. Got in contact with The Foundry, may get some representation from them, and hoping to get someone from SideFX. Martin from Autodesk has been attending, which has been very helpful. | . | USD . | The is now a Wiki on Confluence, richer experience and easier to make contribution. https://wiki.aswf.io/display/WGUSD/USD+Working+Group . | Working Group meeting mostly covered the Wiki, some issues with ID management. Meeting notes are going to the Wiki, they aren’t in the repo. | Daniel: Cory and others have done a good job of scoping out the broad structure and the kind of information to be captured. Setting up goals and non goals has been a good mechanism. | No answer right now about USD WG and Open Source days. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | Website and documentation updates is a common topic across projects . | Doug: OpenColorIO is busy on revamping the website and documentation as approaching SIGGRAPH.This SIGGRAPH is “feature complete” milestone for V2, preparing DigiPro presentation on August 12th. Overhaul documentation system, new logo, lots in progress. | Cary: OpenEXR making progress on web site. Asked whether best to keep project source in main repo or separate repo. Ended up preferring a separate repo to hide the chatter from the website update. Also get the whole website source when you clone the repo if only a single repo. Will lift content from existing site into new site, should be online soon. Sarah Martin at ILM has been helping, taking the documentation that was written in OpenOffice years ago and available in PDF format, and converting it to an online format, which should make it easier to access. Target is Open Source Days. Also have a new logo. New Logo . | Cary: new repo with separate imath seems to be working. Building OpenEXR against the new library is forcing a large reorganization / modernization. Retiring the “ILM” name from the library, will be called “openexr” rather than “ilmimf”. Long overdue cleaning up of the code structure. Now working on CMake / CI infrastructure to build and deal with the new dependency on the iMath repo. | Larry: some of the modernization is also in progress such as putting const_expr in the right places. | Cary: compatibility with the CUDA “half” type is also done. | John: LF has an internal team that can help with logo redesigns. OpenEXR did 3 iterations with LF graphic designers. | John: a number of the project TSCs have discussed a shift over to the Apache CLA, a plurality of these projects are looking to make the shift in the short or mid term. Still owe the exact wording of what will come in the EasyCLA system, waiting for this for OpenTimelineIO and OpenShadingLanguage, which will help to make over the graduation hump. | John: will submit a PR against the tac repo to update the sample CLAs (currently LF short form). JF will submit an issue against the repo. | Chris: OSL just waiting for final copy of CLA, hopefully can be fast tracked through legal and move forward. Last thing OSL is waiting for. | USD working group: JT has been working on Jupyter workbooks, will add intro and advanced documents, could be moved to a Wiki or repo. Could be leveraged across all ASWF projects. Daniel: moving towards a modern style of documentation, “learning as you are doing”. JT: Jupyter notebooks allow running code, interspaced with text documentation. Netflix did a good blog post on how they are using it. | Eric: TAC meeting in 2 weeks is coincident with ASWF talk at Digipro, would it be possible to move the. Daniel: waiting for Open Source Days schedule as well, which may require moving some WG meeting dates. Daniel: we can move TAC meeting, easiest way to go. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 12 August 2020 | . | . ",

    "content": ". | CLA Followup (John) . | PR for guidance: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/186 . | Follow up from last meeting, guidance and links to specific CCLA and ICLA that we are attempting to move our projects to, and recommend for new projects . | Lots of good discussion on that PR. Are we ready to go? . | John: looks like we’ve addressed all the pieces of feedback so far, so doesn’t seem like there are any blockers? But don’t want to assume from other TAC members. Had Steve Winslow from LF, he added a few comments. We are trying to be careful how we advertise this, “ASWF 2020 CLA” since there are a few accommodations on top of the Apache CLA, so we use a different naming. But when talking to internal counsel for sign off, can make it clear that it is a derivative of the Apache ICLA/CCLA. | Daniel: looks like we should go ahead and merge, further PR should be directed to the PR thread. | . | Conference Updates (Emily) . | Good to pre-designate people who will like to answer questions to make it faster to switch on video . | 200 registrations so far . | All sessions will be recorded, uploaded to YouTube a week later . | Brian: for Q&amp;A, will chat happen within the Zoom webinar tool for chat? Emily: someone will be designated to deal with questions, we can point people to project Slack channels, for some of the sessions that don’t have one, we can ask channels to the ASWF Slack. At conclusion at each project session, we should redirect people to Slack, it won’t be possible to continue Q&amp;A after the end of the session. | Sean McDuffee: talk has multiple speakers at different locations, is that OK? Emily: yes, that’s not a problem as long as everyone is designated as a speaker. Also probably have one person to have a single slide deck rather than having different presenters sharing their own section of a deck. | Daniel: using Keynote with Zoom screen sharing can be tricky. Pre-baked PDF can help to reduce points of failure. | Cary: can we do a dry run before the day? OpenEXR will have several speakers. Emily: can set up a dummy Zoom session. Sean McDuffee: would be great for us as well. Brian: same for OpenCue. JT: usually referred to as a “tech rehearsal”. | SIGGRAPH: will be doing a Foundation Update on Monday August 24th, plus whirlwind project updates, for people who can make SIGGRAPH but not Open Source Days. | SIGGRAPH BoF participation: costs and barriers to entry (Michael). Need “Enhanced” registration level for BoF access. Would it make sense to sponsor access for some of the important initiatives we want to present? Emily: it is SIGGRAPH’s BoF policy, shows that it’s important to have our own events. But ASWF may be able to cover costs for ASWF presenters at SIGGRAPH costs. No details have been shared so far, what platform will be used, or if recordings of BoFs will be available. | Emily: most of the content will be a repeat of that’s presented at Open Source Days, which will be openly available. Want to figure out updates from groups that aren’t doing separate updates during Open Source Days. | Conference app and privacy (Whova - JF). On Zoom, moderators can decide how much data to be shared. | Daniel: a number of attendees are busy with Digipro, unfortunately it wasn’t possible to reschedule TAC meeting. | . | Git branch names (Kimball) . | TAC list thread . | Kimball: OpenEXR looking at renaming branches to work towards D&amp;I goals, and have a large merge ahead so good time. | USD has renamed its primary branch “dev” where they accept PRs. | We should try to agree to do the same thing on all repos, it’s not a hard requirement but would be helpful to be consistent. Should we use “dev” like USD? Does the D&amp;I committee have any feedback on this? . | Brian: what about “main” which seems to be prevalent (GitHub recommends that). Kimball: not thrilled with “main”. Andrew: GitHub went with “main” since it’s generic, doesn’t make a statement as to policy, so they just went with “main”. Daniel: doesn’t tie in with any of standard git branch naming schemes. | Cary: confusion of looking at online documentation &amp; examples, makes sense to stick with as straightforward a config as possible? . | Daniel: good time to draw feedback from projects. Kimball: don’t necessarily feel strongly about it, but a good moment in time to make this change for OpenEXR. Don’t have a strong opinion as to “main” vs “dev”. Nick Porcino had voiced objection about “dev” vs “release”. Unclear as to why USD went with “dev”. “Dev” doesn’t make sense for EXR images repo. Chris Kulla: OSL had been leaning towards “dev/release”, “main” is too vague? Andrew: might push towards “dev” / “release”, if the default branch you get when you clone a repo is “dev”, it tells you something about where to submit PRs. Cary: OpenEXR Images repo could have a different structure. JF: projects are supposed to have a stated branching strategy document. Chris: what do you get by default, the “dev” or the “release”: GitHub lets you configure what is the default branch when you clone a repo. Kimball: the UI also reflects that, where your PRs go by default. Can encourage “dev” as the default destination for PRs. | Daniel: should we use our template project to have a proposal as to our recommended GitHub / git setup? Capture essence of this discussion. To be discussed as a PR on the Sample Project. Could add a poll to decide between alternatives, looks like there’s some weight behind “dev / release”. | . | OpenTimelineIO incubation review process (Josh, John) . | Pushed to next TAC meeting due to availability . | Will try to do presentation and vote during the same meeting . | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB (Ken) . | NanoVDB . | Sub project in the main OpenVDB project, being worked at NVIDIA . | TSC voted to adopt project into OpenVDB last week . | Ken not available this week, anyone else have info . | JT: from attending TSC meeting, looks like an important project, looking to work on a release of information for Open Source Days, perhaps have been talking to Emily? It looks like a really important project for OpenVDB users. | Emily: have been in touch with OpenVDB, working on a press release, some questions as to whether it gets its own repo or not. | JT: decided on repo structure at yesterday’s TSC meeting. Also releasing version 7.1. | NanoVDB is a similar implementation of OpenVDB but targeting mobile applications, so subset of functionality, no external dependencies. Also uses the GPU. | Daniel: there will be technical interest within the TAC, as well as how does this get organized without ASWF organization, hopefully in time for events next week. | . | OpenEXR (Kimball, Cary) . | Cary: preparing for the Open Source Day next week, and companion initial release of OpenEXR 3.0. Things may be proceeding a bit more slowly than expected, may not have an actual release in time for the presentation. | Nearing end of Owen Thomson internship, he’s interested to keep working for the project (also he’s looking for a full time position if anyone is interested). | Kimball: rewritten the core of EXR, around 8x faster to open a header, will present at the Open Source Days. | Daniel: topics on migration and dependencies of VFX Platform 2021 which already specifies OpenEXR v3. How can we ease the transition. | Kimball: there will be additional APIs for thread safety, but existing API should still work as is, some C++11 related cleanups, but leaving typedefs in there, some headers may have deprecation warnings but will still be present. | . | OSL (Chris) . | PR posted by Larry for the new official CLAs . | Will take a vote on the next meeting (after SIGGRAPH) . | “In the home stretch” . | . | . | Working Groups . | CI (Daniel) . | No CI meeting since last TAC meeting . | Some activity with OCIO and GPU CI . | Andy: builds are trying to happen but having issues accessing the GPUs for OpenGL, in touch with AWS to try to resolve issue . | Provided a S3 bucket for OpenCue to pass artifacts between passes if needed . | 14 day retention policy, can be used for other projects who might need this as well . | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion (Carol, Rachel, Emily) . | Submitting charter this week . | Meeting earlier this week, looking for volunteers to lead various initiatives, university partnerships and outreach, join calls, mentorships . | Not a ton to update, should have more activity after SIGGRAPH . | . | Python 3 (Ashley) . | Meeting earlier this week, anyone can give update? Will check in on the notes. | . | USD (Cory) . | Meeting this week. Continuing to flesh out Wiki, “State of USD-Interest” newsletter for August. Looking to update the landing page of the Wiki to give more guidance to anyone who lands there. Will announce Wiki more widely on usd-interest . | Doc and tutorials on USD web site a gentler introduction . | Aloys has working USD inside a Jupyter notebook . | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 26 August 2020 | . | .

    "content": ". | Welcome new voting member: Laurent Ruel, Unity Technologies . | Laurent currently on leave, so will be introduced at next meeting. | . | OpenSourceDays, SIGGRAPH updates (Emily) . | 700 registrants, 495 unique attendees over the course of 2 days . | Unique attendee counts per session is available . | 75% of registrants had never attended ASWF events . | Majority were engineers working in VFX / animation . | Majority had 10+ years experience . | OpenEXR / OpenVDB / OpenColorIO were projects with majority of attendee experience . | All videos are on YouTube . | OTIO had to reschedule, will be in the next week or 2. No need for new registration. | SIGGRAPH: both bofs both had over 300 attendees, . | OpenSource Days ahead of SIGGRAPH? We might want to do it after SIGGRAPH to use SIGGRAPH to bring people to OpenSource Days . | A lot of educators and students participating SIGGRAPH events, and had people from education reach out (University of Florida Open Source Club) . | Good leads for mentorship programs, identify where we would have needs . | Put together intro slide deck in D&amp;I group to reach out to schools . | Feel free to share feedback on Open Source Days with Emily . | Larry: agreed with having general sessions at SIGGRAPH first, has been a busy last few weeks for everyone, maybe we could change having exactly the same meeting at SIGGRAPH and OSD to avoid confusion. | Cary: would have wished for more discussion / questions, missing the sense of “everyone in the room”. Curious how the other sessions went? Did other sessions seem quiet? . | Emily: across the board the chats / Q&amp;As were fairly quiet, even at SIGGRAPH BoF it was fairly quiet. May want to “seed the chat”, also Zoom Webinar vs Zoom Meeting format, ASWF used Zoom Webinar, SIGGRAPH had Zoom Meeting which required more moderation. General BoF opened the Zoom meeting early and had informal chat between attendees before the meeting. Also D&amp;I panel had more interactivity due to less structured nature of the event. | Some of the attendees we had were very new, perhaps we should have a separate “state of the union” meeting for projects once or twice a year? So we could plan individual events, with more engagement of the community. Not so difficult to set up, Emily can help coordinate. | Daniel: everyone realized that Slack is a good way to pick up these conversations, in some cases there was good flow from sessions into Slack channels. Would be a good idea to welcome new attendees in Slack channels. | Larry: all of the Slack channels picked up new members after the meetings, also a thread about Slack archiving / limited retention of Slack free. | Emily: 80 new members, more than half of all messages are direct messages. Not a lot of technical discussions on the mailing lists, immediacy of Slack helps. | . | Governing Board updates (David) . | David summarized Open Source Days for governing board . | Taking some of the ideas and requests for project activity, and how do we take those beyond “that’s a good idea”? . | Working group for Collaborative Remote Review? (extension of “Media Player”) . | Datasets for testing and/or machine learning . | . | . | Vote: OpenTimelineIO Incubation review . | Deferred to next meeting | . | Vote: Diversity &amp; Inclusion WG endorsement . | Charter README.md . | Rose: Charter similar to what was presented in previous meetings, targeting high school and college age students. Internal goals: leadership and projects, how to improve diversity. Third goal: how to help member companies and individuals get education around D&amp;I and how to make things more inviting. | Carol: split into goals and deliverables, came up with some deliverables: . | Mentorships and partnerships with schools and universities . | Set D&amp;I goals internally at AWSF . | D&amp;I ambassador per project to take part in D&amp;I activities . | Blog and landing page for D&amp;I WG . | First 1-2 years as schedule / target . | . | Daniel: D&amp;I WG has a long term schedule . | Daniel moves motion to endorse adoption of WG charter . | All Ayes, no abstains or nays, unanimous endorsement | . | Rachel: successful presentations at OSD and SIGGRAPH, received a lot of emails, especially from educators interested in combining forces. Also interest from SIGGRAPH itself which has its own D&amp;I initiatives. In the process of going through and responding to emails, looking at potential partnerships. Emily looking at the LF mentorship platform, Community Bridge. Emily: now is a good time to capitalize on recent interest. | John: a lot of this is driven by interest generated at OSD, also have universities looking at associate membership. Some overlap with Larry’s work on GSoC, CommunityBridge is used by many LF projects, but also use GSoC. We should set up a meeting to help identify leaders to drive the membership program, can reuse experience with other LF projects. Can send Doodle poll to figure out best time for such a discussion. | Carol: would this initiative be run through D&amp;I group, in partnership with all the member projects? John: it’s up to this group / TAC to decide how they want to go about it. Is mentorship mostly focussed around D&amp;I, or broader scope? Has been done both ways across LF projects. Emily: some of this will depend on how many volunteers show interest from projects, and who wants to do the work. Carol: D&amp;I would like to take a leadership role in this, can set up a call with John to figure out how the program runs, and help guide the projects through mentorship. Rachel: no matter how it gets run, there should be a component of the D&amp;I group in it. Even if a mentorship program isn’t solely focussed on D&amp;I, it can still help with D&amp;I objectives as long as those objectives are taken into consideration. | Daniel: timing is excellent since GSoC projects are wrapping up, we’ve learned a lot through those, and have been a test case for a very structured kind of mentorship, all projects have had a very positive experience. We have a lot of momentum going forward. | Brian: OpenCue had great experience with GSoC, would love to be involved with mentorship initiative. | . | Working Group Updates . | CI . | Charter README.md . | Somewhat retroactive but good to codify . | CI WG should get is own repo . | Already has Slack channel, but no separate mailing list . | Daniel moving to endorse, JF seconds. All ayes, no abstains or nays, CI WG charter adopted. | . | Didn’t have meeting last week because of overlap with OSD presentation . | Targeting SIGGRAPH for successful run of GPU build for OCIO: made it just in time . | Michael: got a successful build setup using AWS CodeBuild. Commits to Master Branch will target GPU builds, was a bit tricky to figure out how to run without X server, but recent commits added EGL headless rendering. | Michael: would need to be able to run this in context of PRs, but secrets management is problematic. Andrew: common request, GitHub working on this. | Daniel: to be followed up in CI working group. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Covered above | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: quiet meeting this week due to SIGGRAPH, working on trying to get statements from DCC vendors about Python 3 status. Stuck in feedback loop of vendors not wanting to drop Python 2.7 as long as customers demand it, and studios aren’t going to move to Python 3 as long as Python 2.7 is supported in DCCs. | Daniel: is there anything the TAC or projects can help with this standoff? . | Ashley: SideFX / Foundry / Autodesk are involved, would be useful to have contacts with other vendors to get specific statements from them. | VES Tech Committee informal Python 3 survey . | . | USD . | Cory: Wiki has been announced to usd-interest mailing list . | Will review content added at next meeting . | Interesting discussion on “pseudo standardization” of schemas, initially wasn’t a stated goal of the WG, but there seems to be some desire for this. Asking the USD team what they would like to see the USD WG do in that regard. Make sure that there are no competing standardization efforts. | Looking at some non-VFX interest in USD: civil engineering, VR . | Some discussion on standardization of USD itself, looking at VFX Platform BoF discussion on USD, whether it should be included or not. Having internal discussion about that. | . | . | Follow ups . | Git branch names (Kimball) . | TAC will discuss choice made by OpenEXR and discuss whether that should be recommended for other ASWF projects. | Cary: settled on “dev” and “release”, was supposed to roll out earlier this week but ran into issues. “Release” will be the default branch which people will get when they clone by default, “dev” will be where PRs are merged, previously called “master”. | Andrew: GitHub now allows setting a default name at the organization level, it’s still set to default of “master”, in the future will switch to default of “main” . | David: took a look a discussion between core developers, everyone agreed on “main”, so it is a bit odd to not go with what everyone has agreed to. | Daniel: probably need to be further discussed . | . | Slack archiving (JF) . | Actively harvest useful messages into other locations . | Or pay for full archiving . | Larry: is price per user means any user show has ever posted? . | John: based on active user during period of time, Slack will compute active users within last month (not clear if it’s people posting or just login in). So could have a large increase in your bill if many new users join. | Michael: are there any considerations between LF / ASWF for archival of communications, and SoX-like legal requirements? . | John: outside of more official action by a board, LF doesn’t know that there are requirements to record anything. | Wave: what kind of money are we looking at? Daniel: we should look at usage over last 6 months, and see how much this would cost in a paid model. Of course we wouldn’t want to direct messages. | John: current cost would be $1928 for this month, 426 members. So possibly $30K budget. | Emily: we probably don’t want important conversations to get buried in Slack history anyway. | Larry: Slack is not permanent. John: this is not the first foundation to deal with free vs paid Slack. Cost is always an issue, Slack can be a challenging tool for finding important conversations, the searching tools are not as good as with a mailing list. Slack tends to be good for instant / interactive conversations, otherwise mailing lists or GitHub Issues may be more appropriate. Depends on how projects like to collaborate. | Could look at other alternatives such as Mattermost, but it’s a different tool, with several costs associated with transition. | Andy: LF is currently investigating Matrix as an offer for all projects, including bridging into Slack. JT: these bridges can be quite useful. | . | . | Mentoring (John) . | Technical Project updates . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | Sept 9, 2020 | . | . ",

    "content": ". | New member introduction: Laurent Ruel, Unity Technologies . | Welcome! . | Laurent: started in broadcast, worked at TVA Networks in Montreal, production, control systems, on air automation systems, architecture, coding and design. Election and newsroom systems. Started a company in 97 to make a video server / clip / stills store / character generation on a PC using Matrox cards, became part of Kaydara. Worked on Motion Builder, leading engineering / QA / training / support, became part of Alias, then Autodesk. Product Manager on Maya, then cloud backup at Mozy (sp). Then Grass Valley (monitoring &amp; routers) before joining Unity in 2016, responsible for engineering in Verticals Group: architecture, engineering, construction, M&amp;E, manufacturing and retail. | Daniel: have you had any previous engagement with the ASWF projects? Laurent: not so much yet, but working on OTIO integration, USD, OCIO. | . | OpenTimelineIO incubation review: Josh . | Vote: Project status and next review . | Josh: A bit over a year since OTIO was accepted in incubation stage in ASWF. Set some internal goals around community and industry awareness. A number of items on the checklist to graduation have been done. | Healthy number of committers . | Substantial ongoing flow of commits . | Document project owners and committers . | Technical lead representative to TAC . | Initial license scan . | … . | . | Community contributions: . | Netflix &amp; Storm Studios: image sequence . | Autodesk: spatial coordinate systems schema . | Rodeo FX: EDL improvements . | GSoC: Java &amp; C bindings . | Igalia: xges improvements . | Upcoming: . | Blender community (JT Nelson) . | Frame.io . | Ahead.io (Cezanne &amp; shott.io) . | . | Would be good to have more formal channels to engage with companies . | OTIO is very please with working with ASWF . | Outstanding issues: . | Modified Apache 2.0 license . | TSC Charter: blocked on license (informal TSC for now) . | CII best practices badge . | Currently at 61% . | Security expertise &amp; guidance needed: what does security look like in a framework that has Python plugins? . | Hoping to focus on this . | . | . | Still work to be done before graduation stage: would like to remain in incubation stage. | Requesting continued assistance moving forward with licensing issues. | Daniel: great presentation, gives a roadmap for moving forward. Are there particular areas where TAC can help unblock some issues, offer expertise? Josh: hard to put finger on what needs to happen with licensing. There isn’t a lot of urgency getting these issues straightened out within Disney organization. Setting a timeframe could help to provide momentum. John: it’s a decision of the TAC to renew incubation renewal. ASWF / LF has been working with OTIO for a year, licensing issues have been starting to get unblocked, in communication with Disney legal. There is a path forward, but these things can take time. | Josh: what are we trying to “protect against” in the context of security requirements? Daniel: we grappled with those issues with the first set of projects, could be time to revisit. OpenEXR has been the most visible example and gives a good baseline. Some of our other projects have a plugin approach as well (OpenCue). | Josh: OTIO does see the value moving forward, but who gets to judge “how secure are we”? . | Larry: we had this set of discussions with some of the earlier project, a simplified view is that issues related to crypto and login security are typically not relevant to our projects, we don’t have user IDs, logins, PII… So many of these criteria don’t apply to our projects. But because these packages can be embedded into other systems, we don’t want to be the source for security vulnerability. Static Analysis + some Fuzz Testing is sufficient to self certify. Kimball: can also define subsets of the projects that have higher security requirements / a build mode for just the core of the system without the extension mechanism. | Daniel: security reporting and address process needs to be in place. Josh: got a notification that a component of the build system had a vulnerability, and was able to address it. John: there are offerings from LF to help with vulnerability management. | Stephan: like the idea of being able to disable the plugin system, or enable only internal plugins. Would be good to have partnerships with the community to help adopt processes from the other projects. | Josh: as commercial applications start adopting OTIO, expecting more feedback from vendors. | Eric: any guidance on how often fuzzing analysis should be performed? Kimball: OpenEXR already had a fuzz system built into it, but it takes so long that it only gets run once a week, same as static analysis pass. The Google OSS Fuzz service is outside the project’s control. | Daniel: for OpenCue we extended a maximum review period of 6 months since they wanted to move out of incubation. What would OTIO want? . | Josh: 6 months sounds fine, sooner would be better, but that would be a good deadline for now. | Larry: should we think about triaging what the holdouts are, and expect the project to have made substantial project on parts of the process it has active control (CII bad, TSC minus the licensing specifics). Josh: that sounds reasonable. | Larry: present motion to review in 6 months with expectation that parts of the process under control of the project have been addressed. Second from Kimball. | All ayes, no opposed or abstain, unanimous, adopted motion. Congratulations! . | . | Follow ups: . | git branch naming: Kimball . | Example of how it was implemented for OpenEXR . | Kimball: haven’t actually adopted the new scheme yet due to other priorities, EXR TSC in unanimous agreement, for a development / code project, having branch names as “development” and “release” was clearer than just “main”. Even if not actually released (yet), code in the “release” branch will be less in flux than on the “development” branch. But could be fine to use the “main” branch for the EXR Image repo (no development process there). | Larry: the possible source of contention is that almost all other projects are settling on “main”, agrees on “rel / dev” is better, but being different than anyone else is a “tax on the future”, newcomers to the project will have to face a (small) hurdle. Also might be worth delaying since GitHub is offering guidance that they will offer features in a few months to help deal with branch naming issues. So if we postpone until GitHub is ready, we might avoid some initial complexity. | Kimball: more generally does it make sense to have a discussion about branching strategies across all ASWF projects? . | Nick: GitHub project pages can be used to document the branching scheme . | Kimball: happy to consider the support from GitHub . | . | slack archiving: JF . | Matrix and other LF supported paths: Andrew . | Daniel: most of discussion / advice was that although the cost of moving to commercial Slack instance (about $30K/year), the value is limited, and we should make sure to not depend on Slack as a long term archiving solution. Also a lot of our Slack use is private IMs. | Not going to request funding from Governing Board to switch to paid instance. | Can someone articulate the contrary view? Or should the LF consider alternatives to sidestep some of the limitations. | Kimball: should be an ephemeral communication, anything long term should be recorded in documentation / code. | . | . | Working Groups . | CI . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: had great meeting on mentorship process, working with LF . | Monthly D&amp;I meeting today. | Will reach out to TSC chairs to look at what mentorship projects would look like for those projects. | Daniel: lots of interest in mentorship at the TAC level . | Larry: since GSoC just wrapped, 3 TSC representatives should present on successes and challenges of GSoC projects from this summer at next TAC meeting. Although led the GSoC effort in general, don’t have specific perspective of the work performed at the project level. Daniel: will schedule this for next TAC meeting and make sure the relevant people are available. | . | Python 3 . | USD . | . | Technical Project updates . | Update on candidate projects . | WG on Collaborative Remote Review . | Last round of outward facing events, Collaborative Remote Review was identified as important industry project. | Looking for someone to take up that project: sponsor and lead the effort. Kimball: have we had previous discussion on this? Is interest, interesting but potentially challenging project. | Daniel: in all the surveys since even before ASWF creation, an open source media player / review tool was identified as a need. Clear development path, ability to embed, ease of integration… Good candidate for open source, some studios have internal tech they may want to open source. Presentation by DJV. Haven’t found a way to move beyond that stage. | WFH requirements in last 6 months has added to this need. How do you do collaborative “theater” reviews when you can’t put everyone in a theater. | Kimball: wouldn’t necessarily want to lead this group, there are people at WETA who are much more knowledgeable about in-house playback system. Daniel: sponsor does not necessarily need to be the lead, can delegate. | Daniel: up to the WG to define the scope. Kimball: will try to get something started. | Michael: there’s a bit of a chicken and egg. In this case it’s more a topic for discussion. Every studio has customized their own or third party player. So very open ended topic. | Kimball: seems the scope wouldn’t be to define an actual project, but a baseline of features required to meet this need. | Sean: are we also looking at existing projects? Kimball: yes, seems appropriate. Daniel: good topics for discussion. JT: meeting with Darby from DJV tomorrow, he would like to have more clarity as to what it would mean for a project like DJV to be involved with ASWF. So could make sense for him to get involved in this working group. | . | Datasets for testing and/or machine learning ( John M has survey ) . | https://forms.gle/3Fgg9QkjRufcYGkp6 . | John: every time a survey comes up, content / data asset repository keeps coming up and floating up the list of desired. Talking to David Morin, we should create a survey to help better define what a Creative Commons data repository would look like. Link above, please complete this short survey before EOD today. Trying to find examples out there of not just “pull only” repositories, but also ones where you can contribute. | A good topic for the creation of a working group. | A new repository of ASWF assets / logos: https://artwork.aswf.io/ . | Is a curated list of links to existing datasets be a good start? Google Doc as a way to start? Some discussion on the topic on the OTIO Slack channel. | John: trying to get an idea of the scope and focus of such a repository. “A data driven approach to a data repository” . | . | . | Next meeting . | Sept 23, 2020 | . | .

Supports GCP and Azure, AWS is in progress. Not merged yet, looking for some testers before merged into mainline. Overall went great, very beneficial to the project, establishing pipeline to bring new contributors into the project. Ended up with 20-25 applicants, about half turned into formal applications. That ended up being a big job to communicate with students and review applications, but once started it wasn’t such a big load. Wrap up took a few days, put together a blog post (see https://opencue.io blog), get code in shape. Biggest lesson was to have good material in place to bring new developers into the project: how to get started, set up dev environment, good first issues. Hopefully now that this is done, next time we need to onboard someone it will take less time. This is beneficial to the project no matter what. Could have perhaps handled 2-3 students, depending on how engaged the other TSC members are. Another lesson learned: identify potential mentors in the lead up to such a mentor, make sure they are engaged, same as identifying committers to the project. Keep in mind “who would make a good mentor”. Would like to see expanding this beyond GSoC, perhaps a summer and a winter session. Would doing it outside of GSoC might get a different kind of applicant? Some of the GSoC applicants may have been more interested in the GSoC credential rather than being actually interested in the specific project. | Eric: mentioned setting up dev environment and vetting the initial candidates. Brian: a lot of it was one time work due to newness of the project: add to add documentation for Windows setup for instance. Didn’t spend a lot of time walking potential applicants through submitting a first PR. Daniel: we required an “initial PR” as a proof of commitment, side effect may have been extra load on the TSC members. Brian: yes, but it was worth it, now have a lot of this infrastructure in place for next time. Should keep the requirement in place. | OpenEXR (Cary): imath and general usefulness to industry was raised early on by the community, languished on wishlist, but seemed like a good GSoC project. Had 3 competent applicants for the project, took on Owen Thomson from Rochester Institute of Technology, just finished program in Motion Picture Sciences, good fit. Didn’t involve writing a lot of actual code, but meant treating a lot of existing code very carefully to avoid breaking backwards compatibility. 1- creating new repo 2- moving code from existing to new repo, reorganizing, retrofitting OpenEXR cmake infrastructure, updating documentation, modernizing code (constexpr, CUDA decorators, making it compile with CUDA Half type). Exception handling, remove dependency on IEX library, clang-format, adding unit tests. Met with Owen 30 minute a week, Kimball as well, then attended TSC meetings. Set up test repo to experiment with moving code. Probably spent about 5hrs a week on this project over the course of the summer. Some of the technical skills required were C++, some of the issues are tricky, constexpr, peculiarities of CUDA. Owen was familiar with git, but needed to know more about administrator level knowledge, as well as GitHub repo management. He learned a lot about CMake and CUDA. Soft skills required: consensus building (how should the repo be structured, naming conventions, these hadn’t been fully worked out). Required flexibility, willingness to iterate, submit as a PR and deal with comments. Sometimes direct guidance would then be commented on by other OpenEXR contributors and required adjustment. What went well: the new repo is in good order, it works, no significant missteps along the way, nothing got messed up. It could have been a mess, there’s no guarantee that someone without substantial background in a long running project would be able to make this work. Showed up to all the TSC meetings, and he got a good education, engineering skills, was profitable for him. What could have gone better? Was hoping to be able to release by end of summer, but we’re not there yet. That’s more an issue with the project itself, lack of availability from core contributors, would have needed more time to reach that milestone. A suggestion to Owen in the spirit of a “performance review” at end of the summer: he wasn’t quite as communicative as could have been desired, his email communication could have been more proactive, was also hoping to use GitHub issues as a communication channel, but that didn’t end up happening as hoped for. Didn’t get as much community engagement as would have been desired. For next time: regular checkins on a weekly (or more frequent) basis are crucial, mentor must be willing to make that commitment. Should be more explicit about process to follow, set explicit milestones and deliverables, it would have been a more rewarding experience to have an actual release / milestone / deliverable at end of engagement. It is beneficial to the project, but also community engagement, we are offering an education to the student. Brian: found similar issues with communication from student. | OTIO (Joshua): very pleased with result of GSoC. Intern, Karthik, was very productive and proactive. We should emphasize the selection process at the beginning to avoid getting someone who won’t be successful. He learned a lot through the process, was able to complete main and stretch goals, as well as “surprise” PRs that he contributed. Nick spent a fair amount of time working with Karthik. Not many video calls, would have been better to have more. Nick: Karthik was amazing, on his own initiative he kept thinking of new initiatives, mocked up a proposed a PR with a compositor for the viewer. Many pleasing moments. One lesson: the project values correctness and functionality, builds that support PIP. If these had been laid out up front (for instance every new function must have a positive and negative unit test). For instance first contribution was interval algebra, requirement for test suite came as an “afterthought”, would have been better to anticipate that upfront. Another big project was wrapping OTIO APIs in C, took a fair amount of investigation since many possible approaches. The pattern he picked seemed to pass muster, he went through and wrapped hundreds of functions, but there wasn’t a design clause. Nick didn’t have a chance to inspect the design, it took a lot of time investment to check the work, validate that the tests worked, discover that some things are not obvious to a student. So “noun / verb / subject” pattern not consistent. Made a dozen a work items in response to C integration that need to be addressed outside the GSoC process due to time constraints. But still very successful, huge undertaking, he was very thorough and didn’t make mistakes. Other large project was Java bindings, lucky that contributors from Netflix provided help and guidance, they are likely to be primary consumers of the API. Karthik was able to take on all this feedback, integrate a memory management model that felt native to both C/C++ and Java. Managed to deliver this. Joshua: communication from GSoC teams: they were very strict about deadlines, regardless of current WfH situation, even for missing deadline by a few hours. Unclear what timezones times on the GSoC site are in. | OpenTimelineIO GSoC student final report . | Larry: it sounds like all 3 candidates “knocked it out of the park”, the 3 projects would likely want to do this again. 2 projects didn’t get a “slot”, one project joined ASWF too late. Should we presume we want to do this again? Should we ask for more slots? What is the limit of how many students we could take on? We don’t have to decide this now. Joshua: would not want to have more than one at a time, time commitment would be too large. Wave: was there any communication between the students across channels? Brian: possibly not. Cary: Owen mentioned there was a forum (on the GSoC side) for students to communicate with each other. Some students on other projects mentioned that they didn’t get much mentorship. Wave: might be a good idea to provide some explicit way for ASWF interns to communicate with each other. Joshua: emphasis was to incorporate Kartic in OTIO communication channels, but would be helpful to connect the students together. Brian: would make sense to create a Slack channel for next year. Carol: from D&amp;I perspective, improving this process and onboarding would help. Nick: Slack is a very useful channel for this. | Larry: great summaries from everyone, we can pick up further discussion on the TAC mailing list / Slack channel. Let’s do it again next year, expand it so that every project can get one student, unless a project decides it wants more than one student (seems a consensus that 1 is about right). | . | Follow ups . | Recommendation for VFX Platform Long-Term Support . | Larry: 8 years into VFX Reference Platform . | Multiple “walls of compatibility” . | How far back should we support? CI currently only supports a couple of years back . | Cross project dependencies (OCIO / OIIO) . | Daniel: OpenVDB has clear policy of 3 years back (2018-2020), only project with clear policy. CI supports 2018 and on via containers. | Availability of RedHat DTS for download . | Larry: does OpenVDB not issue patches for older versions? Many studios use Maya versions that still rely on gcc 4.8. Daniel: will ask OpenVDB folks explicitly. | Daniel: Any statements from other projects? . | Larry: don’t want to keep things running “forever”, can know what are the oldest versions used at his studio, but don’t know about other studios. Gordon: episodic TV clients may run very old versions. Official Autodesk position is “3 releases back”. Joshua: how do we know what’s in use out there? If we only base ourselves on big studios, does this leave smaller facilities behind? Would a survey of ASWF users would help? That would give a data point. Larry: there is “strength in numbers”, don’t want to be the only project to have a strict cutoff policy. Wave: the bigger the studio, the older the software they are locking on. A survey of ASWF organizations may give a conservative number. | Daniel: action item to look at a mechanism to gather usage / version information. | . | Vote: Policy to use non-paid Slack with guidance to move important discussions / decisions to other formats . | Document security best-practices . | . | Working Groups . | CI . | GPU support is now working for OCIO | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: series of meetings with some external university and community participants. Would like to kickstart “D&amp;I Ambassador” program, representative from D&amp;I group to attend every TSC meeting, work to get on agenda. Get a more concrete idea of what that ambassador would mean to each project. | Rachel: points made about onboarding are of interest to D&amp;I group, hoping an Ambassador could help with that process. Not just technical infrastructure but also how to make sure that new contributors feel welcome. Also ties in to mentorship initiatives, how do we open up more mentorship / internship opportunities. | Larry: having looked at all the people who applied via GSoC, a lot of national and ethnic diversity in the applicants, but very little diversity with respect to gender. May want to seed certain communities about opportunities such as GSoC. Rachel: not necessarily ready to tackle this yet, but considering how to get people in colleges interested in open source, coming up with good ideas based on conversations with university educators. Still early days on those conversations. | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: big question at the moment is around how to help unblock the transition and encourage studios to start moving. DCC vendors are “supporting Python 2 as long as clients require it”, and clients reluctant to move until forced by end of support in commercial DCCs. | What does this mean for VFX Reference Platform in terms of commercial DCC versions? . | Daniel: we now have Python 3 versions in various degrees from all the key vendors. | Ashley: the amount of discussion in the group has discussed, have gotten past the initial steps of “what do we want the group to be”, there’s less to discuss since the group is no longer in a startup phase. | . | USD . | Corey: couple of threads of discussion around self organized standards, find a way to make the WG a forum to present this work (came up in context of BIM / civil engineering work in USD). How does WG organize around that, want to make it clear this is a place for this to happen. | Role of USD in the VFX Platform, will deliver on WG minutes from 16-Sept-2020 . | . | . | Technical Project Updates . | Update on candidate projects . | Datasets . | John: results from industry survey. WG coming together to put together a potential project for ASWF to hold high quality datasets for testing. Governing Board spoke about it yesterday, putting together a Doodle Poll | . | Collaborative Remote Review . | Will spin up a WG, some people flagged their interest . | John: will put together a similar poll for this project . | . | . | Next meeting: 7 October 2020 . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | OpenCue Packaging and deployment (Brian) . | How to package Python and all dependencies into a single, installable binaries. | Discussing with John: potential issues with licensing of binary distribution? If OpenCue handles this at the project level, would likely opt to not distribute binaries, instead make it easy to build installers by the users themselves. Not ideal, but less complicated from a legal perspective. | Would be better to do this at the ASWF level rather than at the individual project level. | John: IANAL, but the gist is that there are different considerations to distributing binaries instead of source for an open source project, implications with patents and encryption. Not impossible, but extra work required. Some project communities go down that path, can implement export controls for instance. Most projects leave that as “downstream” activities to be handled by end user, vendor or Linux distribution packager. | Docker is a whole other can of worms, LF has a blog post from April 2020 on the topic. Daniel: where’s the line between artifacts, containers, and other forms of binary distributions. | John: many “unknown unknowns” in terms of licensing. | Daniel: LF can provide some experience from other projects, but we need to take this “journey” on our own. Makes sense for OpenCue not to want to do this on their own. | John: LF is more than happy to help provide guidance, and may require some degree of assistance from LF (export control infrastructure for instance for encryption). | ASWF is a larger legal target, so need to be careful. Want to make sure that assets distributed downstream are as “clean” as possible from an IP perspective. LF has projects that do binary distributions, but many projects decide not to. | Also can increase the support burden: users will expect that a provided binary gets supported. Often downstream vendors willing to take on support burden rather than the projects. | Daniel: one way to try to sidestep as many “unintended dependencies” is not to provide a “single, all inclusive” download, but instead work within an existing component manager where the other dependencies come from somewhere else. John: also good if you integrate into those ecosystems. | John: if a distribution is a Python package, which is a collection of Python scripts, so in fact you are distributing “source code” (say via Pip). So it can often be a case by case decision, likely no “one size fits all”. | Daniel: OTIO is another group talking about distributions in the context of Python. Josh: OTIO is a hybrid model, Python package via Pip, but also a C++ core, so providing Python Wheels to include pre-compiled versions of the core library. Would be helpful to get guidance as to the implications, what does OTIO need to pay attention to. All the compiled code is OTIO code , any external dependencies have been copied into the repo, rather than having implicit dependencies on a large number of external projects. This is a useful discussion for OTIO, hadn’t considered yet the implications, was mostly providing binaries as a convenience to users. | John: if any of the projects want to go down this path, can bring in Steve Winslow for some legal help, has helped with some projects before. Projects can reach out to John directly. | Daniel: immediate need from OTIO / OpenCue, so these projects can help to break some ground. | . | Follow ups . | TAC chair term / voting . | Brief discussion to formalize terms around TAC chair position. Overall feeling seems to be that it would be a good idea to have a process in place. Work with voting TAC members and John, we will vote on these changes as the TAC, and then use those mechanisms to call for a vote of the TAC to vote for a leader. | Larry: this is the 2nd anniversary, last year we had a vote, but it was informal. John: all our projects have different term limits, election last time had Daniel elected through the end of 2020, so we have some time. Ties into TAC membership renewal. Some communities decide to have these elections in December or Early January, at that point there’s a clearer picture of whether there will be membership changes that affect the TAC. | Larry: are the company membership tied to calendar years? John: yes. Eric: are there terms on Governing Board? John: no, except for general members and TAC leader. There is a position like the Treasurer, which has no explicit term limit. | . | Recommendation for VFX Platform Long-Term Support . | Daniel: Try to capture majority of use cases. | Survey on Project and Platform usage to drive with data, also capture what our projects are doing right now, but draw data input from our user base, what versions are they using, and what are their expectations. | Also not just versions, but how are they using our projects (request from multiple projects). | Question of the Python 3 upgrade window, that will stretch from this year into following years, that’s going to cause some tension / pressure. Python 3 support / requirement also helps to sunset older versions. | If anyone has interest / experience in this kind of survey, would be useful to have input. Also any analogies from other industries / foundations. | Larry: not sure how to add this to the survey, but issue of which VFX Platform year to continue supporting is important, but there may be other axis we may want to provide guidance, such as CMake versions, which are outside the scope of the Reference Platform. | Daniel: interesting list of compatibility and interoperability aspects that our projects are using, for instance API compatibility, binary data format. OpenVDB is doing some interesting work, such as ABI symbol versioning to allow swapping the version of OpenVDB which is shipped with commercial applications. Do other projects feel that this is relevant / useful? Or is this niche for OpenVDB. | Kimball: worth discussing for sure, one approach with customizable namespaces, we can change the API if we want to by putting it in a different namespace, so two versions can live side by side in separate DSOs and namespaces. Replacing a version shipped with a DCC could be very interesting. | Daniel: best practices for making isolatable dependencies fall outside the scope of the Reference Platform, but we could take on. | . | Vote: Policy to use non-paid Slack with guidance to move important discussions / decisions to other formats . | Daniel / John: how should this be phrased? John, not sure it needs to be formal? “TAC recommends to continue using the non-paid Slack, with guidance to move useful topics into other forums”. | Seconded by Kimball . | All ayes, no nays / abstains, adopted . | . | Document security best-practices . | Capture what we’ve learned from other projects, translate somewhat loose terminology from the CII badge approach to specific recommendations for current / new projects. Need a couple of individuals to take this on for the projects they have been involved with. Onus was tilting towards OpenEXR to take the first step (from previous discussions). | Cary: OpenEXR has been exposed to the issue more than anyone else since official CVEs were reported. Settled at a place where OpenEXR knows what to do to handle these, could write up a summary of what the process is, which could be useful for other projects. Daniel: yes, this would be very useful. | Cary: ASWF is not pushing on security as a primary concern, keeping our house in order is important, but no one in ASWF has demanded proactive action. | John: LF launched Open Source Security Foundation which may have some relevant info that could be applicable to our projects. Project is intended to bring a lot of expertise into a single place. | . | Kickoff: Assets Repository Working Group . | Quick discussion at the end of the last meeting . | Kick off happened earlier this week. | Eric: broad agreement that this is an interesting area, 16-17 people showed up at kickoff meeting from studios and vendors. | What does it mean? First project is to identify high level goals. Servicing goals of individual projects with datasets for testing and conformance. | But also for R&amp;D, make problems visible to the outside world. | Difference between scenes that are really used in production, with lots of cruft, substandard data, vs a cleaner / more portable dataset. Do we want “best practice” / maintained assets, or a snapshot of “real world” assets. | Assets can also be used for onboarding / mentoring students. | Hard to get assets out of studios, Moana Island scene was a success by Nick Cannon, try to remove hurdles of licensing, where is it hosted. Identify what sorts of assets would be most useful, and come up with a small set. | Meeting again in 2 weeks, Wave will lead the group. Homework exercise: look around your company and identify what could make a good asset to donate to such a repo. Working Group does not aim to build such a repo right now, but first identify what makes sense to have in such a repo. | Michael Min: git is typically not good to hold this kind of data, are we referring to an actual GitHub repo? Eric: no, just a generic idea. | Josh: frame.io volunteered to hold such a repo for editorial data. Would need to make sure this is OK with ASWF, as well as long term survival of such a repo. | . | Kickoff: Media Review . | Happening tomorrow | . | Hacktober feedback . | Do we have projects that are tagged? Daniel: no, we have some “first issues” tags, but no explicit Hacktober tags. | Did we get any of the traffic from the early onslaught? Larry: haven’t seen anything in the repos I’m involved. Cory: nothing in the USD repos. Brian: got 4-5 spam PRs, all docs changes, nothing to main repo. | Daniel: could be handled at project by project level. | . | Working Groups . | CI . | No CI working group meeting since last TAC meeting | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: working with Rachel and Emily, research meetings with some universities, met with ACM D&amp;I group to look at webinars, starting to create an intro to ASWF slide deck. Next meeting is next week. | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: not a ton of updates. Last meeting covered Python 2.7 support going forward, and what that means to the VFX Reference Platform. Group agreed that not extending Python 2.7 support officially makes sense, will make things harder for some studios, but need to prod the transition along. | Autodesk has provided an official statement on how much longer they intend to support Python 2, hoping to get the other DCC vendors to also provide such statements. | https://vfxpy.com visualizes the spreadsheet capturing the state of the migration . | . | USD . | Cory: spent last session extending discussion on role of USD in VFX Platform, help to pick a version that works with a VFX Platform year. | Discussion on ABI stability, and how integrators can avoid some of the issues coming with fast pace of change in USD. | A “universal bridge”, shim that sits on top of USD that could help integrators deal with ABI changes. | No concrete proposals yet, but may form a smaller group to discuss offline and come back with a proposal. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting: 21 October . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Follow ups . | Survey: project usage, dependencies: Daniel, Emily . | Gather project specific questions that have come up repeatedly, affecting our CI project, how we manage dependencies, how we address security issues (OpenCue / OpenTimelineIO, trying to cross the CII badge process). | Useful start from work done by OpenCue for a project specific survey, reached out all all project TSCs to formulate questions specific to their project, as well as questions common across the projects (support for historical versions of VFX Platform for instance). | Current State of Survey . | Want to start survey in Early November, don’t delay the work already done by OpenCue. Want to follow up on this annually so we can provide an annual update. Also good for the annual ASWF cycle, show / indicate progress in our ecosystem to our members. | What could we do as action items based on these answers? . | Emily: will help with the process of submitting the survey. Will work with John to refactor common questions. Would be good to provide specific examples, such as “what software do you use” under OpenColorIO. Good to have Yes/No or multiple choice answers. Daniel: can always have an “other” option. | John has set up a SurveyMonkey account. Would be good to have a branching strategy so people can easily skip sections not relevant to them. Similarly for whether survey takers are OK with sharing diversity info. | Larry: would be useful to have basic info such as “developer/user”, “studio / independent / vendor”? Good to identify our “core constituency”. Emily: yes, will have identifying info, but optional to allow anonymous contribution. Larry: would still be useful to have some anonymous answer such as “studio vs independent”. | Eric: are we looking for a per-studio answer? Emily: more individuals, “the more the merrier”. | Daniel: OpenCue survey may have been written with a more targeted audience? Brian: yes, initially written with a “one response per deployment” target. Can always deduplicate based on company name. Emily: not clear how to regulate this. Eric: concerned that users won’t fill a survey that takes more than 5 minutes. Current state is much more than that, few respondents would know answers to all the questions. | Larry: is this just a wishlist? At first glance it looks overwhelming. | Daniel: we should do a cost/value evaluation, can use UI design to “hide” some of the size of the survey? Can we offer some kind of (intangible) reward? Emily: projects should rank their questions, should be 5-7 per project at most, and multiple choice is better. Can always provide a “reach back to me for further discussion” entry. | Brian: this is already the “trimmed down” version, and has mostly multiple choice questions. Were hoping to get contact info from the survey so they could reach out to respondents. | Daniel: need to find right way to present this. Larry: project leaders should look at their questions and answer “would you change the course of development based on answers”, and if the answer is no, maybe that question can be dropped. | Daniel: Ken from OpenVDB : question about “why are you not using a project” can be useful as well. Maybe we do need to split into broad based vs more targeted. | . | Packaging and deployment (OpenCue, OTIO): Brian . | Started email discussion, no conclusions yet | . | Security best practices . | OpenEXR process summary: Cary (absent) | . | . | Technical Project updates . | Via slack: Contribution of rust bindings for projects | . | Working Groups . | CI . | Details of next incarnation of VFX Reference Platform, relationship to CUDA, OptIX, how to access those components that require signing EULAs for downloads. | How to facilitate distribution of projects without getting lost in minefield of binary distribution (licensing, IP, export controls). Already in that territory somewhat with Docker images. | Consideration of how to use Docker Hub in the future, may need to sign up for a paid account to not have to deal with throttling of free tier (slower CI builds due to delays of pulling ASWF containers from Docker Hub). | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Rachel: having conversations with universities, how can students learn more about Open Source, learned a lot about how universities understand Open Source. Several professors joining the D&amp;I WG. | Ambassadors from projects: identified 4, looking for 2 more, this person will join project discussions with specific perspective of D&amp;I. | Will join TSC meetings to present the ambassador program. | Blog initiative is making progress, list of topics we want to cover, putting dates against these topics, first publish targeted next month on aswf.io blog. First one is “language in code”, next is “unconscious bias”. | List of proposed topics . | Emily: looking for volunteers . | Rachel: working on a webinar series, recorded, available for college age students. Followed by series of career based webinars. | JF: could leverage facility HR teams? Emily: yes, trying to reach out, but webinar wants to present to comp sci grads what are the different career paths, what skills are needed, and which open source communities can help develop these skills. Facility HR teams such as DNeg are already participating. | Wave: lots of facilities have internal web pages / blogs, could get ASWF D&amp;I blog posts onto some internal blogs. Could be possible to get our content “shopped out” to a lot of companies. Helps to get people in these large companies to know more about ASWF. | Emily: once webinar series is kicked off, there will be a page on the ASWF web site, including a D&amp;I section, but need content first. | Wave: there’s an internal “Open Source at Apple” site for instance. | Rachel: similar to conversation with SIGGRAPH, how we could partner and share resources / sources. | Wave: there are opportunities to reuse work, and establish contacts. Carol: a lot of the work is establishing connections, so this could be really useful, welcome any contacts on who to talk to at various companies. | Emily: for D&amp;I committee, scope is so large, trying to focus on students for now, somewhat younger demographic. Will develop material that can be reused later on, but current focus is mostly students. | Rachel: ways to reuse the same work. Michael: just hired a new intern, so material that targets interns in companies can be useful. Rachel: working on a package of information that can be delivered to professors. But yes, eventually could target that info with SIGGRAPH, companies (same material, different packaging). | Emily: blog content can definitely be repackaged. If you know about existing content that could be reused, please share it. | Have been using a public Google Driverather than a repo, also a shared calendar, good “source of truth”. | . | Python 3 . | USD . | Cory: USD’s role alongside the VFX Reference Platform, which part should be useful for who . | Idea of a “universal bridge”, need concrete ideas, there have been ideas for proposals to the group, such as how NVIDIA Omniverse does extensions. | A couple of additional proposals: NVIDIA + Pixar physics scheme, what are the motivations. | Still TBD for scheduling, but working on a presentation agenda for coming working group meetings. | Next meeting start of November . | . | Assets . | Meeting yesterday . | Eric: Rob Bredow shared experience of how to publish the Moana data set. Details of licenses, looked at some assets already out there, “Hyper Space Madness”, “Sony Zombie Rig”. Some people shared projects under way at their studios. | Interested in estimating hosting cost, how big would contributed projects be. “What was the first reason an exec said no when you suggested contributing”? . | Meeting notes . | Michael: Next meeting is Election Day in the US, should we move it forward a week or a week after? Eric: OK with any option. Probably don’t want to change the cadence. Can discuss on mailing list and figure out the next meeting. | Larry: plea to make sure that everyone is included on the mailing list. Please everyone interested should join the mailing list. | John: can provide Confluence space if required for a wiki . | . | Review . | Daniel: WG focussed on scope and mission, still in “WG scoping phase”, will likely take a little while to set up the infrastructure. | “Our WIP goal statement is “ The Purpose of this working group is to investigate and define areas of relevance and interest for the Academy Software Foundation to participate in the support of a publicly available open source playback and review system targeted at the media and entertainment industry.”We anticipate generating a report and recommendations to the TAC and Board with those opportunities enumerated. We are currently aligning on scope, by trying to define the attributes and expectations of a complete system, then narrowing to what requirements might fall within the scope of a playback device.We are currently iterating on the definitions of those attributes and a collection of user stories to identify the audience for any future recommendation.” . | . | Rust bindings . | Larry: started on OpenImageIO discussion, multiple attempts at writing Rust bindings for OIIO. A lot of the work for C++ projects is to write a simplified C binding around the C++ API, then you can add a other languages relatively trivially. | Joshua: C bindings, then Java bindings for OTIO was a GSoC project. But concern about testing load, but best if a single official implementation is used. But who will maintain it? If there is a community that is motivated to support those (Rust) bindings, then it’s worth doing if there’s a real user base. | Larry: would be happy to adopt this in OIIO, but only if there are people committed to maintain and develop it. Several people volunteered themselves, but revealed they had already started on projects. There are industry people who are very enthusiastic about Rust. | Joshua: trying to put these repos in a separate repos that sub-modules the main one, so not limited in releasing OTIO versions because the bindings aren’t up to date for instance (not have to be in lockstep). | Daniel: how do we encourage this, do we create a working group? Or a per project basis? JT: project by project, if the developer is enthusiastic about Rust, but not a big movement to Rust in independent space. | Larry: intrigued by it, but not written Rust yet due to lack of library support, “chicken and egg” situation. | Invite person who proposed it to next CI meeting, help with administrative aspect of crate registration. | Kimball: for OpenEXR, redoing core as C to help make bindings to multiple languages. | Patrick: looked at OCIO, discussion of having new bindings is really interesting, but has a cost in development, also we need to provide infrastructure, documentation, unit tests. Should be seen as a project, investigate the use case, what are the consequences of doing this. OCIO has another binding (Java) and third party code, but no knowledge or CI support, so not supported in V2 OCIO. If you have a “one shot” contributor, this can be an issue, consumers of the project will expect continuing support of an additional language binding. It increases the effort to add new APIs / functionality to projects if you want to do it correctly (API headers, test cases, documentation…). | Daniel: having a compact C API helps with reuse (as OpenEXR is doing). Patrick: most of the projects have C++ API, adding a C API, that’s another interface to support. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting: Nov 4 2020 . | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Documentation | . | Discussion on channels . | Daniel: Slack seems to have been quite successful, do we agree on that? Are we OK with the risk of ‘spreading the discussion too thin’? . | Larry: still see substantive discussions happening that may not be captured elsewhere, not just ephemeral discussions. For example what’s happening in the rust channel. | Nick: trying to aggregate conversation into GitHub repo issues . | Daniel: exactly the conversation we want to have, we can come back specifically for the rust discussion later in the meeting. Also good discussion on the documentation front. Opportunity for cross-project cooperation. We want to put in place best practices. | Also issues with calendars . | . | Security Guidance (Cary) . | https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-sample-project/pull/17 . | Most recent discussions on security requirements came up in context of OTIO and OpenCue . | Cary: two main categories in CII requirements: . | Cryptographic requirements: most ASWF projects don’t have those, except perhaps OpenCue . | Security vulnerabilities: a vulnerability is really just a “bug”, with some caveats. What to do when your project coredumps, or more to the point, what to do when someone finds out your project coredumps, with the additional context of public disclosure. Especially important for projects that implement a file format, ability of attackers to craft a malicious file. Projects that read file, especially projects that are widely used, not just in a studio behind a firewall. But OpenEXR is part of macOS, any software that is used in that context needs to take vulnerabilities very seriously. The mechanism of public disclosure serves the purpose of allowing users of software to track which versions of a software project have the vulnerability. CVEs are a global system to reference vulnerabilities. A CVE ID can be given out by an organization that is registered as a “CVE Numbering Authority”, several companies act as such: Google, Autodesk, The MITRE Corporation is the overall manager of this project, and the “CVE Numbering Authority of last resort”. Getting a CVE ID is simple: you fill a form on the MITRE web site, not completely automatic, since there is a manual review process before the CVE is actually created. Primary context where this is relevant when someone in the public announces to a project they have discovered a vulnerability, having a CVE ID allows tracking that a specific version reported is fixed in which version(s). OpenEXR had a variety of experiences, CVE was filed, no one paid attention (part of the origin story of ASWF). As soon as OpenEXR was transferred to ASWF, the issue was fixed, updated the project documentation, and the CVE documentation on the MITRE web site. | Also got a couple of reports from “security researchers”, who seem to be people who spend full time looking for bugs. Someone presented a file that crashed OpenEXR and required we filed a CVE on their behalf. CVEs aren’t a “bad checkmark” against a library, it shows a diligence about security issues. Bug was fixed, requested CVE ID, new version was released, mentioned CVE in release notes, and notified researcher of CVE ID. | Fuzz testing: process of identifying corrupted / potentially malicious input data that causes crash / misbehavior on load. OpenEXR has had a fuzz testing in its test suite a long time ago. Was approached by Goggle’s ossfuzz project, thought about it for a while, then decided to do it. Google servers generated “random” EXR files and try to load them, and reports bugs when something is detected. Compiles code with -fsanitize command line option. A lot of these reports are “hard to believe” could ever be an exploitable vulnerability, so a certain amount of busy work to be expected, but several actual bugs were found. So the recommendation would be to adopt ossfuzz. Tests the software “along the edges”: test bizarrely sized images for instance. Reports from ossfuzz has slowed down to a trickle, Peter Hillman did a lot of the work to address these. | Tarball signing: back in the days OpenEXR was hosted on GNU savannah, tarball can be signed using GPG on upload, users can download tarball and signature and confirm that the tarball matches the project signature. Somewhat of an archaic process, most projects currently rely on the GitHub release page / process. OpenEXR still does this manually based on request from one of the Linux distros that requested it. So don’t necessarily see this as still very important, but it’s also not a lot of overhead. | There are many other security issues that OpenEXR hasn’t encountered, and may be encountered by OpenCue due to the network centric nature of the project. | . | Daniel: do projects still in incubation have any specific questions on this topic? . | Joshua: a great step forward, very clear, OTIO can learn from this. Thank you! . | . | Rust Bindings (Nick) . | Share the process happening around the Rust discussion, and how it should go forward, points of contact with existing projects, and welcome to new people. | Nick: initiative being taken, something new that generates a lot of enthusiasm. A lot of movement recently in language bindings. C bindings created for OCIO and OTIO (Java as well). Scott saw opportunity to have a consistent look and organization of Rust bindings for VFX projects. Registered a number of Rust “Crates” (packages) names. Conversations started in Slack. At first was unclear what was the best way to host these conversations, created #rust channels, and created a GitHub repo, for now an independent GitHub organization to bootstrap the project, if it pans out, can bring back to TAC. Scott has done a lot of work looking for CLAs, Code of Conduct… Seems to be evolving into what could be a process for nascent community projects. Would be great to have templates that could be used for these projects. Work being done on the GitHub repo could lead to such templates. | Larry: it’s amazing how quickly this exploded from 2 people on OCIO to 40 people on a Slack channel, ambitions are to make comprehensive bindings for a large section of the core VFX projects, all the way up to USD Rust bindings. | Nick: Anders took automatic binding framework, what if ASWF projects had a standard adornment for exported APIs that would make automatic generation of bindings robust. | Scott: motivation came out of a discussion on 3d-pro, decided to start wrapping OIIO, want to see more Rust in the industry, Rust is potentially a better language than C++ in the future for the industry. | Daniel: was the aswf-sample-project useful to this process at all? . | Nick: they should be correlated and cross referenced, might need to take more initiative on some topics, such as “is it appropriate to create your own slack channel”, “what are Wiki resources available (not a lot of statements as to the purpose of the Wiki)”. Should Rust activity belong in the ASWF Wiki, or in a repo-specific Wiki? . | Daniel: should bindings live outside the project repos, or in the projects themselves? In the context of OpenEXR, it could be messy to have bindings “out in the wild”, should C bindings be pulled in to projects as core part of the project? . | Joshua: there’s a tension between “should the bindings be included in our project or a separate thing”. Worry about adding more burdens on the release process. For now the thought is that the bindings should at least be a separate repo, and use the submodule mechanism. In fact would like to factor out existing bindings in the project and move them out. | Nick: interesting point about Java, the core team doesn’t spend a lot of time on Java, could get stuck fixing a core problem, reaching out to Java expertise . | Larry: counter point is that if the bindings are separated out, user doesn’t know if a problem is in the bindings, in the core, or version mismatch between bindings and core. Core developers are likely still going to be burdened by problem reports. If someone does the original work, test suite tests the bindings, and additional work is mostly “cut and paste”, could still be tractable without deep expertise. Also bindings could be covered in the core documentation. | Nick: since there aren’t existing Rust bindings (as opposed to Python bindings that have grown in ad-hoc ways), there’s an opportunity to set standards for Rust bindings for all ASWF projects, would relieve a lot of maintenance burden if all the projects do it the same way. | Wave: would love to see Swift bindings (from an Apple perspective), would be very straightforward to automatically generate from C bindings. | Gordon: seems that this is heading towards a discussion of language adoption in the industry, are we seeing specific trends, studios heading in certain directions. Is this a good discussion topic for this group, opportunity for another survey? Would be very useful for vendors. Could be address in community survey. | Kimball: for OpenEXR, would be convenient to have C bindings, and a chance to make structure changes to the performance of OpenEXR, so was the trigger to start working on C bindings. Makes other language bindings simpler / trivial. WETA compiles most of its own software internally, often have customized copies, use namespace to create custom namespaces. Doing that for C, which could be considered “weird”, if this is useful, we should have an agreement about these approaches, to allow users to override symbols when they need to. | Daniel: as a complement to the VFX Reference Platform, tackling namespace would help components to cooperate. | . | Documentation efforts across projects (Daniel) . | Daniel: a lot of effort in OCIO, also effort in OSL, any other projects? . | Kimball: OpenEXR as well, OTIO as well . | How much integration / cooperation / best practices can we establish across these efforst . | Larry: can’t go wrong with what OCIO did, they spent a lot of time debating the right approach and tools, but the result is very clear, IMHO would have to have a strong reason to not just adopt their methodology. | Michael: reached out to the community, got a lot of contribution, large group of different contributors. System seems fairly effective. | Larry: lesson from OCIO is that it’s not a single person effort, had a separate committee for documentation, with new / different contributors, brought writing skills, graphic design skills. It was a big production, it takes effort to make documentation that nice. | Cary: working on documentation for IMath, found a “hello world” project for Doxygen / Sphinx / …which was very helpful. Did struggle with Sphinx and Breathe, they are complex in the way they deal with templates. | Daniel: is there “hidden knowledge” from OCIO that could be shared? . | Michael: one of the bigger challenges was the workflow of how to have documentation live in one place of your source tree, for instance info from C++ headers end up in documentation for Python bindings. Establishing this pipeline was complicated. Some contributors found / developed some graphs demonstrating the workflow. At first it was somewhat overwhelming, but focussed on developing a Table of Contents that everyone agreed to in a Google Doc, once we established the scope of the work, it was possible to dole out the work. Also had a deadline (SIGGRAPH), helped to get most of the work done in a month, now there’s mostly cleanup left to be done. | Daniel: would be good to highlight key discoveries and processes. | Larry: any documentation on the tooling that was used would be helpful, a single Markdown file that highlights it all would help. | Michael: also developed some custom Python tools that helped, not specific to OCIO, for instance a library to parse Doxygen XML that can be imported into PyBind11, matches a subproject of PyBind11 but doesn’t require clang. | Larry: these tools could also be used internally at studios, useful and good looking documentation is always a challenge . | . | Survey (Daniel) . | Still hoping to follow through with survey, goal is still “early November”. Aim for next TAC meeting. | . | Technical Project updates . | Working Groups . | CI . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Rachel: Working on first blog posts . | Meeting with Governing Board . | . | Python 3 . | RV 2021.0.0 released with Python 3 support . | (Ashlie from Slack): The Python 3 working group has been looking at a Python 3 guide from WDAS and whether we can extract parts of it to include in our own deliverables and documentation about Python 3. We’ve also found issues with Qt related segfaults which we thought were caused by Python 3, but may actually be due to Qt 5.12 and it being more strict about memory management. So many bad behaviors we were getting with away before now seem to be causing segfaults in Qt 5.12. | . | USD . | No meeting since last TAC meeting | . | Assets . | Review &amp; Approval . | . | GSoC Mentor Summit . | Cary: 2 sections, lightning talks (3 min per organization), our 3 minute was a “plug” for ASWF, mentioning projects and students. | Second session was breakout sessions on topics on how to be a better mentor, how to introduce your student to the organization, but didn’t have time to attend. Seemed to be more oriented towards organizations with little experience with mentoring process. | Very international event, a lot of the participation was from India, if it had been in person, would have been possible to talk to people directly, but didn’t get much out of it outside of giving ASWF presentation . | Next year the structure of GSoC is changing (shorter scope projects), hopefully by that stage we have some of our own mentoring programs in place. | . | Next meeting . | 18 November 2020 . | .

John: suggesting start Nov 30th, opening nominations on Monday Nov 30th, close on Dec 7th, hold election on Dec 9th-16th, announce result on Dec 18th. Animal Logic will downgrade its membership at beginning of the year, so we will need to find a new chair. | . | ASWF Project and Technical Community Survey (John). Emily out this week, will work on it next week. Found some common themes in questions, should be able to push it out soon. JF: any target for the time to fill out the survey? John: want to keep it short, but also cover 6 projects. Each project section limited to 3-5 questions, for background / high level questions, looking at around 10-15 questions. Concern around survey length, can lose people midway through. | . | Technical Project updates . | OCIO: Michael: still working on documentation. Preparing beta release of OCIO v2, not ready for RC yet, but want to have versions that people can test and track rather than just following master branch. Discussions around remaining features, how they will be implemented, while satisfying opinions from studios and stakeholders. | OpenCue: Brian: not too much, keen to see survey move along / answers. What about the Python packaging questions that were brought up in previous meetings? Discussions with OTIO group: there isn’t a ton of overlap between the two projects, trying to accomplish somewhat different goals. OTIO focussed on developer environments, OpenCue more towards end users of a GUI app. But also looking at legal / licensing issues around packaging dependencies, which seems more relevant for OpenCue. | OpenEXR: Cary: Kimball has merged all the major code reorg into master branch, big step towards 3.0 release: same functionality, but reorganized and linking around external imath library. Larry has gotten OIIO linking against this. Path for projects that also need to link against previous versions of OpenEXR and need to maintain compatibility against multiple versions of OpenEXR. Larry: changes in the recent trunk in OpenEXR are such that if you check out “top of trunk” OpenEXR, it may bring out build system issues. OpenEXR list is the place to ask for help, trying to make transition easier for people. CMake target names have changed, code is split into two repos. Don’t be surprised! . | OSL: Chris: not a lot to update, making some strides to involve more people in documentation effort, looking closely at what OCIO has done. Fingers crossed that the CLA will be accepted and hoping to move forward, but things are moving very slowly. | Joshua: no major updates from OTIO . | OpenVDB: no updates . | . | Working Groups . | CI . | See above | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Rachel: can follow along at the content calendar. | 2 major initiatives: blog posts, first post on inclusive language, and what language shouldn’t be used in code, should be posted soon. Hopefully useful resource for people and companies looking at these issues. Second blog post in December on unconscious bias, how it permeates specifically open source and vfx/animation industry. | Second initiative is webinar series targeting student education goal. Trying to pull together a first introductory webinar in February, working with universities and professors, how to grab the attention of students. Introduce open source and its use in our industry, as well as introduce the ASWF. Planning to follow up with a series centered around careers, looking at names of peoples in different technical careers in our industry. Highlight different people and their career paths, as well as what hiring managers are looking for when looking at prospective candidates. | Ambassador initiative: a person in D&amp;I group assigned to each project in ASWF, will participate to these projects, but through the perspective of D&amp;I. Have identified people for every project but one. | . | Python 3 . | Ashley (via Slack): we are still focusing on expanding the best practices document that we have using the Python 3 guide from WDAS. We will also be getting some best practices specific to converting Python bindings in C++ to support Python 3 courtesy of SideFX. | . | USD . | Review &amp; Approval . | Asset Repository . | Wave: Eric from NVIDIA brought colleague Aaron to present about NVIDIA (ORCA - Open Research Content Archive). Can be quite expensive to take in an asset. Got assets from Amazon (Bistro), foliage from Speedtra, C4D, Epic. One third of assets haven’t been released yet due to work required to clean up and prep. Cautionary tale: we will need to put resources in, members volunteering time, contractors. NVIDIA had both engineering and intern resources assigned. | Hoping to discuss at next meeting what kind of asset repository the ASWF would want to have. The more we dig into it, the clearer it is that it would be a big commitment. “It’s harder than it looks” is the general feedback. | Putting up slides on Wiki by end of tomorrow. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Kimball: Alex from Academy and Kimball will present effort to revive the rawtoaces project, to be discussed at next meeting. | . | Next meeting: 2 December 2020 . | Bill Balew: Can we vote to add members to the TAC (Daniel)? John: the TAC can vote to add up to 3 “industry representatives”. So in theory we could nominate Daniel for TAC membership. Larry: it’s probably not in the best interest in the TAC to have heavy contributors to the process get “yanked away” if their companies change their membership. David: “industry representative” mechanism can be used for this purpose. Discussions with Animal Logic as to the implications of this, we are very thankful to the role Animal Logic has played and contributed to ASWF. Daniel wants the TAC to be successful, he intends to continue to contribute. The TAC can invite Daniel as “industry expert”. It is up to the TAC to make this decision. Want to recognize all the great work Dan has done. Bill: does it just take a motion / vote to offer “industry representative” position to Daniel? . | John: can follow up with Daniel to make sure he wants to follow up? Sean: if we only have 1 or 2 meetings, we need to reach out to TAC members. | Larry: can we propose a motion and defer the vote electronically? . | John: will conduct the vote electronically after checking with Daniel. Will also put motion to extend JF’s industry representative seat. | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | New member welcome . | Mark Visser, Unity Technologies | . | Industry Representation Vote results (John) . | John: Call for remaining votes for Daniel and JF as Industry Representatives | . | TAC chair election process (John) . | John: election is open, email went out to the TAC list on Monday . | Please send a note of interest, short bio, rationale as to why one would be interested in this position. | You can nominate others as well, but please CC them / reach out to them first to avoid putting them in awkward position . | Close of nominations is next monday at midnight PST . | Daniel: keen to answer any questions as to what the role entails, open and available to answer questions in public or private . | Need to get vote finalized before end of year, so not a lot of time left, please move quickly . | Commitment is a minimum of 2-3 hrs per week to deal with formalities of meeting process, follow up with agenda items. There can be more stewarding / process alignment for working groups, can grow quite a bit. At this stage probably doesn’t require the TAC chair to be involved anymore, the WGs are working well autonomously. But when new projects get started up, that’s when more involvement is required. Governing Board meetings are monthly, with some reporting requirements, activities such as Open Source Days. Lots of work done by David Morin (chair of Governing Board) as well as John and Emily (LF), incoming chair will be able to draw on their experience and support. | John: try to do as much of the legwork as possible, tend to lean on TAC chair to “have the pulse of the group” and set the driving direction, can “sit in the background” to drive the TAC meetings (Daniel has done that very well). | . | Project &amp; Technical Community Survey . | Daniel: not a lot of progress due to some health issues. Some effort picked up by John and Emily to get survey published before end of year. | Can we agree on a timeframe to work towards? OpenCue / Brian are very keen on these results, they were originally on early November timeframe. | Emily: want to get it out as quickly as possible. Need to cull down list of questions from OpenVDB, and looking for preferentially multiple choice questions, makes it easier to produce results for one thing. Will start putting this into SurveyMonkey when every project has provided info, and can provide preview of SurveyMonkey format. | Daniel: can we set goal of end of next week? Emily: yes, as long as the projects have provided feedback. Brian: don’t want to run into holidays at end of year. Daniel: will have a bit of time to help with this. | . | New CLAs (2020 v2.1) . | PR . | John: based on feedback (predominantly from Disney), landed on some tweaks to original CLA documents. Some concerns about being tied to a specific tool. Incorporated some of the language, changes are in the GitHub repo (see PR link). Aim for projects to aim for these revised CLAs. Anyone who had concerns around CLA has approved these new CLAs, so projects should be safe to move to those if they want. | Each project is able to pick the CLA they want, the decision is up to the TSC, LF is happy to provide feedback / answer questions, and help with transition from previous CLAs. This should have unblocked OSL and OTIO transition to official GitHub ASWF organization. | Larry: any project that wants contributions from the Disney companies will want to do this? John: largest feedback on previous CLA was from Disney, and this version addresses these concerns. | Larry: PR was posted into “ramp up” to Thanksgiving, so still making its way through Sony legal. The diffs are useful to get legal departments who had approved the previous version. | Joshua: putting new CLA through Disney approval process, should hopefully all be fine. | Daniel: will work with the TSCs to move towards the new CLAs so that all projects use the same CLAs (if that makes sense). | New branding for the EasyCLA tools, projects don’t have to use the tool, can submit “designated employees” manually if needed . | . | New project proposal (Kimball) . | Proposal (google doc) . | Kimball: 4 years ago raw2aces project was started under AMPAS, WETA has similar tool which processes 400K images per year. Idea is to revive raw2aces project, and merge the WETA technology. A bit strange of a proposal since 2 subprojects, one is a database of spectral sensitivity measurements, spectral light measurements in the future. One project is a dataset, one project is the code that provides the reference implementation, batch capable high speed converter for DSLR images to EXR / ACES. | Larry: only had a chance to skim the document, are you proposing only a batch tool, or could it be a library that could replace dcraw completely? . | Kimball: there will definitely be a library, would like to have a plugin system to accept contributions from camera manufacturers (ARRI, Sony…), so we can support motion picture cameras as well. But no plans to have a UI, don’t want to make a viewer. | Daniel: is the project a fork or a move of the AMPAS project? Kimball: existing one is relatively minimal, lots of community interest to have such a tool. So a “move + massive upgrade”. Alex: backstory is that there’s a lot of interest in using DSLRs with ACES, converting raw files to ACES container files, requires creation of an IDT. Based on libraw, a bit of a skunkworks project. Realized there was duplication of effort between AMPAS and WETA, better to build a “bigger / better” version that would serve the needs of the VFX community. | Eric: who owns libraw? How does it relate to dcraw? Kimball: libraw is a GPL library, not clear who owns / drives it. Alex: there was an intent by the developer of libraw to create a more maintainable version of dcraw (“a big chunk of C code”), so libraw was trying to reproduce the functionality of dcraw in a more maintainable way. | Larry: libraw is widely used, OIIO uses it, so studios using OIIO to convert raw files are using libraw under the covers. But it is not easy to interface with, an ASWF project would be welcome. | Larry: what would be the merits of a completely separate project, when it has a foot in ACES, OCIO, EXR worlds… Should it live under one of these projects? Or does it deserve its own TSC as a full ASWF project? . | Kimball: the issue of having the database of reference data may justify having its own project? . | Daniel: if there’s a particular set of expertise that borders on the commercial / proprietary that could encourage camera manufacturers to contribute, that could be useful. Larry: was primary concerned that there may be exact overlap of potential TSC members, but it can be justified if there are separate interests. | Daniel: logistically, does the project proposal constitute an adoption of the existing AMPAS raw2aces project (transfer of repo, IP), or is it a new, from scratch project? Kimball: there will be a transfer of info, especially the existing spectral measurement tables. Not clear how much of the code would be reusable. | Alex: don’t have a large development staff at AMPAS, the main developer on raw2aces has moved on to a different position. | JF: would be useful to figure out where the project lives in the “stack” to avoid circular dependencies between ASWF projects? Kimball: don’t think the project will need to depend on OCIO, but will depend on OpenEXR, and OIIO would likely use it. So would be “somewhere in the middle” of the stack. | Larry: how large is the code base? Would it be better to just implement it in OIIO as a reader? Kimball: would be larger than a typical library in a plugin folder in OIIO. Will need to produce IDTs for the different cameras. | Daniel: let’s treat this as a project from the governance / contribution way, we can explore other mechanisms such as submoduling if that makes sense from a technical point of view. We typically have a first proposal for a new project, we take at least a week to digest, formulate questions, and move for a vote at the next meeting. One more meeting until end of the year, should probably move discussion to mailing list to address any other specific questions, and plan to have a vote at the next call. | From the chat: . | From Deke Kincaid to Everyone: (1:28 PM) Out of curiosity, why not simply wrap openimageio and improve its raw support if needed? . | From Henry Vera (DNEG) to Everyone: (1:33 PM) . | I agree with Daniel, that if it encourages more involvement from the camera manufacturers that would be great! . | From Larry Gritz to Everyone: (1:35 PM) . | I’m very enthusiastic about the existence of this project, I would love to replace OIIO’s current use of libraw with this in order to (presumably) improve RAW support. | From Henry Vera (DNEG) to Everyone: (1:36 PM) . | We have some people working in a very similar vein, it would be great to get them more exposure if there are some questions about exactly how to position it. I’m presuming there are other’s with similar experience and tech. Should we arrange a specific call to dive more deeply? . | From Deke Kincaid to Everyone: (1:36 PM) . | My biggest worry is film cameras seem to be on our side for vfx but their photographic wings seem to be heavy on the proprietary and encrypting data in the raw formatsWhich is why libraw is a lot of reverse engineering of raw formats . | From Henry Vera (DNEG) to Everyone: (1:36 PM) . | Deke: I agree with your concern. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenCue: hoping to have user survey data to have graduation proposal . | Larry: Imageworks has finally switched all productions to OpenCue from the internal predecessor system, OpenCue has successfully replaced the internal system and does everything. Largest challenge was switching the database, but that is now done. | . | Working Groups . | CI . | We’ve been skirting around the important issue of package management. So far we’ve used Docker, but within the scope of the ASWF, we want to look at the problem of package management, making software available in a more fine grained, dynamic way that the studios require. | Next week’s meeting: Ryan Botriell (SPI) presenting SPK dynamic environment package management system. Want feedback on the approach they have been taking, had opportunity to look at the work and it looks very interesting. Encourage anyone interested in this topic to attend next CI meeting. | AWS announcement of Intel Mac Minis, availability of M1 Mac Minis in January from AWS and MacStadium. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Emily: webinars will start in mid February 2021 after students back from break. | Working on blog post around inclusive terminology, looking for ASWF project examples. Looking for tips / easy first steps that companies can make. Would help to provide context. | . | Python 3 . | No Python3 WG meeting since last call | . | USD . | Meeting last week, first presentation on the agenda: USD example plugin repository, walks people through how to structure a USD plugin. Some interested parties may be contributing soon. Helps to get people up and running quickly. | Discussed possibilities for an open source camera rig in USD, follow up next week. | Looking for additional topics of relevance to the group, if you think of anything, please reach out via Slack or email . | Daniel: nice to see tangible progress / outcomes . | . | Review &amp; Approval . | Interesting presentation-oriented meeting to that group on Tuesday. Larry: group is in a phase of getting presentations from a variety of in-house and commercial products in that space. Looking to take inventory of what people have done, what the needs are. Yesterday were Imageworks with itview and frame.io, were supposed to be 10 minutes each, both became quite longer + substantial Q&amp;A, valuable discussion. Sean Looper: Is itview on the tablet for open source? Larry: not yet, just showing off what the different groups think is important in a media and review tool, we’ll see where things lead. | Will there be further contributions? Larry: meeting was supposed to make it through 5-6 systems, only made it through 2. Still trying to get a handle of what we want to come out of the WG, so still in exploratory phase. JT: Wiki page is coming along nicely. Daniel: nice to see the Wiki format working well for the WGs. | Joshua: a topic that came up in review and approval group and OTIO: how do annotations work, how to do annotations in USD (attaching notes to objects in space), topic will continue to come up. What’s a good way to organize discussion around annotations in the broader sense. | . | Asset Repository . | Wave: trying to “find our way”, had the most contributions from people in latest meeting, one of the things that came out is that the project could be about giving the “CLA equivalent” for donating an asset. Is it for publication / research? Is it “creative commons 0” and can be used, is it for education only? Personally not interested in legal (I am not a lawyer), but it is important. Leverage the Creative Commons effort. Previous discussions about a reference render of 3D assets, the Moana asset from Disney could be re-exported as USD, is being able to render with Renderman sufficient? If people want to bring up topics, please bring those up on the Slack channel. JT reached out to an archive at a University. Is it an archive? A digital backlot? Still trying to figure out. | John: can help with the legal definitions, how a CLA fits in. Because of the nature of this, may want to take this to the legal committee, which will likely have some feedback. | Wave: would be good to have clarity for the people considering contributions, before you can donate something from a large organization, will need to know under what terms. John: trying to avoid a multitude of licenses. Wave: what’s the ASWF’s opinion on an asset repository? Feel free to discuss this on the Slack channel. | . | We should encourage the Rust people to join the call, is there something obvious the TAC can do to help this effort along. Sean Looper: can we pick a TAC sponsor to act as an informal proxy for those conversations? Would be useful to get a summary of progress, even if there isn’t a “formal” WG. Daniel: a WG could be easy, makes it discoverable, will reach out to some of the people in that space and see if they are interested, would someone be interested in leading a WG effort. Sean: having regular visibility would help. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting: December 16 . | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Good success on the CI front, more work to do on the TAC side . | Lots of activity in the WGs . | Progress on the D&amp;I front . | . | Governing Board Update (David) . | Last Governing Board meeting yesterday, where we review the goals for the year ahead (2021), get alignment for our goals . | Alignment with Calendar Year (2021), including memberships . | Timeline of ASWF history. 2 main phases: original goal of 6 projects in the first year (took a bit longer), reached $1M financing. Phase 2 was FY2020, got disrupted by COVID-19, spent most of phase 2 dealing that in various ways. Extending memberships for certain members hit hard by the situation. TAC continued working on projects and delivering on the mission. Current events highlighted need for D&amp;I efforts. | Entering phase 3: . | Funding . | Projects . | Outreach . | . | Funding: started year at $1M run rate, but at time of renewal, Animal Logic downgrade to General Member, Blue Sky and Cisco cancellations. Back down to just below $1M. | COVID set us back a year in our growth plan, resuming goal of $1.3M by end of 2021. Target approved by the board. | 2021 member company targets: 10 companies targeted as potential premier members, 30 companies targeted as general members. More focus on getting companies to join as general members. | Develop Value Proposition for general members based on the experience and feedback of our existing general members: . | Why join . | Specifics on benefits: how does this work, testimonials . | Cost structure . | Membership application . | Jordan Soles from Rodeo working on this . | . | Use this to seek general membership from smaller animation / vfx companies, also software / hardware vendors that might want to join . | 2 events: ASWF Forum in March, Open Source Days in August . | Working with the TAC, aim to bring 3 new projects in the foundation in FY 2021, we have a harmonious set of projects, but don’t want to stick with the status quo (3 new projects showed on the timeline) . | Looking at potential new projects: ACES, Meshroom, Rez, USD… (not an exhaustive list) . | Develop value proposition for potential projects: . | Specifics on benefits . | Why transfer your project . | How would this work . | How to get alignment internally . | How to deal with typical pushback . | Help to fill the proposal template . | . | Invest in D&amp;I for the long term, and promote software engineers in our industry . | Q: how are the funding targets assessed? Initial $1M was an “ambitious goal” what we managed to reach, new target of $1.3M is a reasonable target we can achieve, underlying goal is to ensure the foundation is well funded, fund our current activities, and funding for new initiatives. There are lots of committees that put together projects and initiatives but have no money to work with, so they aren’t as effective as they would want to be. A chief goal of creating the ASWF was to have the capabilities to reach our goals. Get to a level which gives us a solid base that we can act on and take action. Michael Min: is there an assessment of what these funds would be used for? A: put the money at the feet of the TAC, the “heart” of the foundation. Some funds are there to cover our operations (for instance services from LF), surplus is there for projects such as D&amp;I (budget was provided for activities). Also any projects require funds (for instance for-pay services for CI infrastructure). The funds are there for the TAC. Michael: we need to tell potential members what the funds would be used for. Daniel: we’ve also looked at grants, or our own equivalent of GSoC. | Q: we aren’t significantly spending our existing funds, so why are we growing the fiscal target? David: the ASWF wants to grow the software engineering capabilities and projects common across the industry, want to create a strong platform across the industry, which exists in other industries where open source is playing a major role in developing platforms. We have the potential to do this in our industry: funds are needed for this, but mostly talent. Growing and supporting the TAC, giving the tools to grow the platform, need to have enough money to do so. Push to increase available funds, want to make sure we have all the funds to support any initiatives that come in the future. Want to be funded in the open source world, bringing in new members is how we grow this. Henry: not sure that having more money is the goal to have, we should identify strategic goals, and figure out how much money we need to achieve those goals. We haven’t clearly established yet what we’re using the funds. We need to be clear about what we’re trying to establish. David: the mission of ASWF is well understood, grow the use of OSS in the industry. The presentation to the board implied that context. Approval of projects comes from the TAC, the board is there to support the TAC. Henry: still not very clear. David: it’s up to the TAC to decide. For instance if we wanted to bring USD / ACES / … into the ASWF, and looking at the amount of work, may need to bring in for pay work for instance? . | Larry: we had good success with GSoC, 3 projects who got students got a lot of value out of it, so we may want to fund our expansion of these types of projects. But yes, no one has ever told the TAC “here’s how much money you have to spend”? Would want to see concrete examples of budget items. Michael Min: could make sense to go through a capex cycle for each project to figure out what the monetary needs could be. Agree with Henry, would help to have clarity. Would want to be part of the conversation, and know what we should be budgeting for. David: these are good points, we need to get there, but should know that the money is being gather for TAC and project activities, and that there are funds available for projects (primary) and WGs (secondary, although D&amp;I is a priority). How much money? David to provide as an action item. If there is something that costs money and would be good to do, it is possible. | Henry: what is the value of the foundation to premiere members vs general members? Would it make more money to focus on making the entry point for members lower to keep more premier members, would this not have more value to the foundation overall. It’s a stretch for some companies to keep their premier level. David: the value for premier members is pretty clear: a seat on the Governing Board. We did lose some premier members in this COVID year, but we didn’t too poorly (AMD, Unity), there’s been a lot of expectation of general members would be part of a network of companies. We haven’t delivered that for them, some of the companies have voiced their dissatisfaction with that. Would rather move the value for general members up, especially for smaller / medium sized studios. It’s important to diversify our membership, go beyond the smaller number of large studios we currently have, so this is why we’re focussing on general membership. | Henry: What is the value to the Foundation of the premier vs general membership? David: it’s always evolving, we’ve set the rules and the levels of engagement, not sure we could have lowered the premier commitment level to keep AL at premier level, they are at the general level and have a mechanism to keep valuable commitments (Daniel). We are in good shape in terms of our structure, would be a huge effort to revise membership rules and membership regulations. There was also some reservations as to the current makeup of ASWF projects. There will be downgrades and upgrades over time as to where companies stand wrt ASWF. Questions are very valid, can continue discussion, either in TAC forum or one on one. We are a young organization, and we can adapt over time. | . | TAC chair election (John) . | Opened nominations for TAC chair, but haven’t received any nominations. So looking for someone interested in taking on this role, either for the full year basis, or on a temporary role that could be re-evaluated during the year. Chair role can seem daunting, and it is not uncommon to have trouble filling this role. Chair role is important, both organization TAC activities and interfacing with the board. LF tries to keep the time commitment to a minimum, but crucial role nonetheless. | Robin: willing to help. John: TAC chairperson role is require to be a voting member of the TAC, so needs to be a premier member or project representative. | Daniel: it has been a very rewarding activity. Commitment depends on the level of activity, generally speaking it has trended down as projects and WGs have been self managing. Currently about 5 hours a week commitment. | Kimball: nominate Larry? Larry: nominate Kimball? Larry: currently running 2 widely used open source projects, so not sure has enough bandwidth, this is a big year for OSL, getting GPU support going. Might be interested in another year. But would support Kimball. Daniel: second Kimball. | John: governing board representation has to be a single person, but for the TAC, could have a co-chair, but one of these would be the representation to the board (could swap back and forth). | Does TAC chair count against FTE commitment of a premier member? David: will soon start to keep track of FTE requirement, in first couple of years there was no strict tracking, but will start looking more closely. TAC chair not currently considered, but could be. David looks for a partner in the TAC chair, discussions on developing the strategy, there has to be a dialog between TAC and Governing Board. Role is collaborative. | Do we need to formalize this with an endorsement vote? Yes, we have quorum. | Daniel: nominate Kimball. Larry seconds. Any opposes or abstains? No, unanimous. Congratulations and thanks to Kimball! . | . | Project proposal and discussion: rawtoaces (Kimball) . | Bring raw2aces under the ASWF, revival a tool that people are continuing to ask for, don’t want to duplicate effort at WETA. Path towards what to do with ACES, software + data warehouse of camera spectral sensitivity characterization. How to host ACES test images. | Effort on how to store lens / camera metadata in OTIO, so collaboration. | Kimball: some other data would make sense to store in there. | We had set a couple of weeks to think of questions, why should we do or not do this. Should we move this to the first meeting of next year? . | Henry: very interested at doing this at DNeg . | Where else could this happen: Kimball: could happen on the WETA GitHub . | Daniel: it looks like a strong project proposal. Safe harbor for contribution of data that is otherwise proprietary / sensitive / hard to share, and good place to collaborate with ACES. | Larry: if this project existed, it would be of great use to the members of ASWF . | Larry: move to adopt. (seconded). Daniel: call for vote for adoption of raw2aces as an incubation stage project. No against, no abstain. Adopted! Raw2aces will be an incubation stage ASWF project. | . | ASWF Project and Community Survey (John / Emily) . | Emily: putting into Survey Monkey, should have draft by EOD / early tomorrow for review. There are a few sections that could still use drop-down selections, OpenVDB still need to be pared down (Ken to look at it). | Daniel: want to make sure this doesn’t get buried in the holidays, should be in a form ready to release this week, can then decide when to push it out. Any guidance as to when we should release it? Emily: it can be tricky with the holidays, we don’t necessarily want to wait for the new year, but may want to keep submissions open until end of January so we can do a second push after the holidays. Daniel: we can keep the window open. | . | Follow up: Rust working group? (Daniel) . | Reached out to Rust Slack channel on the creation of a WG (today), some positive support. Should be possible to find the right person to set bridges (Nick attending this call). | . | Working Groups . | CI . | Sony Package Manager SPK presentation: recording . | Larry: SPI is looking if there is enough interest from a user and co-developer perspective to turn it into a ASWF project. If there is demand, will try to push for it. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: 2 things coming up, webinar series, partnership between ASWF D&amp;I and universities, aimed at college age students, introduction to open source, the industry and careers. Information in Slack channel and calendars. Also will start contacting project chairs for the D&amp;I Ambassador program for project, with a connection back into the D&amp;I WG. | Presented a proposed budget to the board based on planned activities. Difference between internship vs mentorship. | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: working on creating a transition guide based on the WDA transition guide, making sure it is applicable globally across studios large and small. Also work coming in from SideFX around C++ bindings, documentation and guidelines around transitioning to Python 3 when working in raw C. | . | USD . | Still pursuing use case examples from industry partners . | Looking at a standard camera rig schema that could be transported between platforms, game engines. Not the same as the implied camera on the USD stage, would be a functional camera. Wave has a working example. | Interest as using USD as an asset standard, the camera as a “character”. | Daniel: using schema mechanism, but making choices as to how to encode things? Michael Min: yes, using variants scheme, want to avoid having to reinvent the wheel in each DCC, avoiding having to remap all the operations on the camera rig. | . | Review &amp; Approval . | Larry: attended meeting 2 weeks ago, 2 in depth demos of representative demos, 2 more this week. When we resume in January, there will be more demos. Trying to define problem domain, a deliverable has not been decided on yet. | . | Asset Repository . | Looking to server the needs of projects first, OpenEXR is the candidate project that already has a data set but seeks to extend / modernize it. Eric: is it for at-scale testing of our existing projects, and other vendors/open source projects, or other purposes? Some discussion about this on the Slack channel. Will discuss further when Wave is back at next meeting. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | Update on candidate projects . | Dependency/version guidance beyond VFX Platform? . | Next meeting: December 30, 2020 . | .

The projects we manage are some of the most high-profile and widely used open source projects originating and used in film production studios. It’s a great opportunity for students to get involved with projects that will be used professionally on films! . The mission of the ASWF is to increase the quality and quantity of contributions to the content creation industry’s open source software base; to provide a neutral forum to coordinate cross-project efforts; to provide a common build and test infrastructure; and to provide individuals and organizations a clear path to participation in advancing our open source ecosystem. Member projects are focused primarily on visual effects and animation production, and at present include 5 distinct software packages. Student summer project applications can be for any of these packages individually, as well as potentially including tasks that bridge between them or provide common infrastructure (they share CI and other resources). The current member projects are: . | OpenColorIO : A complete color management solution geared towards motion picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation. | OpenCue : A render management / job queueing system you can deploy for visual effects and animation productions. | OpenEXR : The specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, the professional-grade image storage format of the motion picture industry. | Open Shading Language : The de facto standard shading and pattern language of physically-based renderers used for film VFX and animation. | OpenTimelineIO : API and interchange format for editorial timeline information. | OpenVDB : Hierarchical data structure and a suite of tools for the efficient storage and manipulation of sparse volumetric data. | .

Home page: https://opencolorio.org/ GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: C++11, CMake, color science . Mentor suggestions: Patrick Hodoul, Doug Walker, Michael Dolan . Project Ideas: . | Add Metal, Vulkan, or CUDA language support to GPU renderer . | The OCIO Processor currently supports rendering color transforms on a GPU with GLSL (OpenGL), HLSL (DirectX), or CG. With Apple deprecating OpenGL support and the availability of several additional high-performance GPU computing platforms, we desire to add shader language support for one or more of these to expand the capability and reach of OCIO. This will also be a critical need for OCIO to maintain full cross-platform support. | Special skills: Familiar with C++, shader development, and implementing graphics APIs. | . | Restore Java bindings . | The OCIO Java language bindings have not yet been updated to support the newly developed OCIO v2 API. Java provides additional Android platform support, but needs some effort to revive. Additionally, adding Java unit test support to OCIO’s CI infrastructure would help maintain the functionality as OCIO continues to evolve. | Special skills: Comfortable with Java, with some knowledge of wrapping a C++ library with the JNI. | . | Add OCIO support to FFmpeg or another FOSS project . | An important effort for OCIO is expanding the libraries and applications where OCIO is implemented. Users have specifically called out FFmpeg as a library and command-line tool where they would like to see OCIO support, but any other FOSS project leveraged by digital artists or production pipelines could be considered. This could also include upgrading an existing implementation to support the OCIO v2 API and leverage new functionality. | Special skills: Familiarity with prospective host library or tool, and knowledge of working with image buffers and authoring plugins. | . | Develop GUI for interactive OCIO config authoring and visualization . | OCIO is all about color management, but the visual results of a config author’s decisions are not verifiable until the config is generated and loaded into a host application. Learning and using OCIO could be greatky aided with a GUI which provides interactive visual feedback and validation while a config is being authored. This could be a standalone Qt or PySide application, or an expanded plugin within an existing graphics application like Foundry’s Nuke. | Special skills: Experience with GUI and graphics programming in C++ or Python, understanding of UX, and interest in data visualization. | . | . OpenCue . Home page: https://www.opencue.io GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: Python, Java . Mentor suggestion: Brian Cipriano . Getting Started: . Contact Brian Cipriano «cipriano@google.com» and join the opencue-dev list. Project Ideas: . | Create a Web GUI . | Design and begin implementation on a new, web-based GUI to eventually replace OpenCue’s existing PySide2 application GUI. This will consist mostly of front-end work; the new GUI should use the existing OpenCue API on the back-end. Design, including tech stack to be used, will be done in collaboration with the project leads. | Special skills: UI/UX design, front-end development | . | Create a REST API . | Create a REST API to complement OpenCue’s existing gRPC API. Backend should be mostly shared between the two. | Special skills: REST API design | . | Create a Cloud Management Plugin . | Extend the OpenCue GUI to add a plugin for scaling the pool of OpenCue workers running in the cloud. The plugin should use at least one of the major cloud providers (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or Amazon Web Services) but should be designed in way where other cloud providers can be easily added. | Special skills: Cloud development and APIs | . | Create Installers/Launchers . | Create installers (.exe, .msi, .dmg, etc.) and/or click-to-launch wrappers for existing OpenCue components. To goal is to make OpenCue more user friendly by reducing reliance on the command line and providing an intuitive click-to-install/-launch experience. | Special skills: Desktop application development | . | . OpenEXR . Home page: https://www.openexr.com/ GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: . Mentor suggestions: Kimball Thurston, Cary Phillips, Larry Gritz, Nick Porcino . Project Ideas: . | New python bindings for Imath using pybind11. | Our core C++ library for vector and matrix types, which is widely used by other projects, needs an overhaul of its Python bindings to switch to using pybind11 | . | Split Imath into a separate project and modernize . | The main library is for dealing with OpenEXR image files. But several helper libraries are bundled, including a widely used vector, matrix, and math library known as Imath. We would like to split this off into a separate repository (which will then be a dependency of the image file library). There are several possible sub-tasks: . | actually splitting the library into separate repo and adjusting all the CMake build scripts | make almost all of it exception-free and marked properly as noexcept | mark const and constexpr as widely as possible. | . | . | Explore and benchmark compression methods . | Design a methodology for assessing compression and decompression speed and file sizes. | Benchmark the currently supported set of compression techniques across a variety of represenative images and document the performance and compression ratio tradeoffs among the choices. | Speculatively implement additional compression techniques such as zfp or zstd (and possibly others) to find out if they offer advantages over our current set of compression methods. | . | Performance evaluation and regression detection . | We currently have a test suite to verify correctness, but not performance. | Design and implement performance tests as part of our testing framework. This should probably cover a variety of image file scenarios and settings. | Extend our build and CI system to automatically detect performance regressions or improvements for submitted code changes and proposed releases. | . | Expand “Simple” API . | Update the IlmImfRGBAFile interface | Expose a pure “C” interface to the DSO | Write a sample python binding using this C api | . | Amend test suite to get closer to 100% coverage . | Current tests cover about 75% of the C++ code base, as reported by SonarCloud. | Implement tests that validate the behavior of the uncovered components. | . | . OpenTimelineIO . Home page: http://opentimeline.io GitHub: https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenTimelineIO Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: C++, Python, CMake, knowledge of how NLEs and DCCs are used, knowledge of EDLs a bonus . Mentor suggestions: Josh Minor, Stephan Steinbach, Nick Porcino, Eric Reinecke . Project Ideas: . | Progress Callback API . | Some import and export operations are time consuming, and tool authors would like to provide progress estimations. A progress callback, presumably with a percentage or other measure would enable this. | OTIO file format adaptors are written in Python, so this would be a Python-available API | . | Javascript Language binding . | Use emscripten’s WebIDL or Embind to provide Javascript bindings for OpenTimelineio | An open question is whether the adaptors, such as for AAF, would be available under Javascript. The adaptors are implemented in Python. | . | Otioview as a web app . | Otioview track and timeline metadata viewing . | Add metadata introspection and navigation on timelines and tracks | . | C Language binding . | A C foreign function interface (ffi) would enable bindings for languages other than Js and Python. | Example applications would be Lua bindings, and remote procedure calls. | . | Reusable timeline display widgets . | Otioview has a widget for Qt. Having the widget separately available for other apps would be great | An ImGui variant | A generic widget assuming only the availability of mouse interaction data and simple draw calls | . | C++ and Python operators for time ranges . | Functions such as “meets”, “overlaps”, and so on. | . | C++ and Python time coordinate system class . | Coordinate system implementation and operators to enable operations such as local to parent, world to local, and so on. | . | opentime_clock for std::chrono . | bindings to allow meaningful interoperation with std templates that have time arguments | . | Add OTIO to another ASWF project . | Identify another ASWF project that might meaningfully interoperate with OTIO and implement it | . | Add OTIO support to an NLE or DCC . | As an example, the generic widget project could be used to build OTIO support into Blender | An OTIO adapter could support time based media, such as Grease Pencil storyboards in Blender | . | . OpenVDB . Home page: https://www.openvdb.org/ GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: C++14, Git, CMake, (Knowledge of Houdini is also useful) . Mentor suggestions: Ken Museth, Dan Bailey, Nick Avramoussis . Project Ideas: . | Delayed Loading on Windows . | Introduce support for delayed-loading on Windows by modifying the temporary file implementation in the core OpenVDB library to make use of the Windows- specific std::fopen flags for temporary files (“TD”). | Help to improve the Windows-related build, CI and documentation. | Background Info: OpenVDB can generate very large files and even with the fastest solid state drives, I/O performance is still a common bottleneck. Delayed-loading (sometimes referred to as lazy-loading) is about reading only the VDB data that is absolutely needed. An example use case is being able to clip or delete voxel data from the VDB before the data has been read from disk resulting in an overall increase in performance when visualizing data. | . | Improved Level Set Rebuilding . | Modify the rebuilding of VDB level sets to improve the flood-filling operation that can eliminate desirable features. | Background Info: Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) operations include union, difference and intersection compositing of two or more level sets that will result in a new level set. An example could be subtracting some level set spheres from a level set of a cube to generate a “Swiss cheese” level set. If the narrow band or transform of the source level sets does not match the target level set, they must be completely rebuilt before they can be composited which can result in eliminating desirable features of the source level set. In particular, the rebuilding algorithm converts to polygons and back, which will cause holes in the geometry to be filled. The Polygon -&gt; VDB rasterization could be special cased to use the original VDB to determine sign, thus avoiding collapsing holes. | . | Multi-thread Sequential Algorithms . | Introduce new multi-threaded algorithms that use leaf and tile traversal to replicate existing single-threaded tree algorithms (such as tree::activeVoxelCount). | Introduce new extrema and statistics tools (such as tools::extrema) that are multi-threaded using leaf and tile traversal. | Background info: Investigations carried out using the existing sequential tree-based algorithms in OpenVDB have demonstrated a large performance improvement by multi-threading across different levels of the tree data structure. In addition, OpenVDB provides general purpose leaf and tile traversal for computing extrema and statistics, however the most intuitive way to use these is by calling them with a tree iterator which is very slow. Both of these performance improvements would use Intel’s TBB and OpenVDB convenience classes such as tree::LeafManager and tree::NodeManager to introduce multi-threading. | . | Improve Filter Operations to Densify Tiles and Optionally Dilate . | Automatically densify specific VDB tiles required to perform different filtering operations such as gaussian smoothing and handle all edge cases. | Provide an option to automatically dilate level set VDBs as required when filtering based on filter and voxel sizes. | Background info: OpenVDB tiles are constant-value nodes designed to optimize storage space and improve performance. However not all algorithms, such as gaussian smoothing turn these tiles into dense nodes (often called densifying) when required so as to generate the correct result. In addition, it is left up to the user to specify the correct amount of dilation to perform prior to any filtering based on their filter size and the voxel size. A beneficial feature would be allowing the user to opt-in to dilate automatically up to some threshold. | . | Optimization using SSE/AVX Intrinsics . | Investigate opportunities to improve VDB performance using vectorization and SSE and AVX intrinsics. | Background info: OpenVDB already has optional SSE/AVX build flags, but minimal use of any of these intrinsics. There are lots of potential operations such as bit-counting, finding least significant bit, SSE/AVX operation on floating-point values (e.g. math::Vec3) and integer operations (e.g. math::Coord) that would benefit performance. | . | . Cross-project infrastructure . ASWF-Docker . GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-docker Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: Python, Docker, Bash, CMake . Mentor suggestions: Aloys Baillet, JF Panisset . Project Ideas: . | Better docker image discovery via automatic readme uploads to DockerHub overviews on image push (modern Python 3 development, dockerhub rest API). These readme files would populate the “overview” tab on the docker hub pages such as this one: https://hub.docker.com/r/aswf/ci-openexr. | Investigate RPM (yum packages) generation from docker ci-packages such as https://hub.docker.com/r/aswf/ci-package-openexr. These RPMs would potentially be hosted on an artifactory yum repo which would enable any RHEL or CentOS user to very easily install many VFX packages. | Create a prototype of a windows docker image equivalent to the linux ci-common and ci-base images to be able to compile VFX packages such as OpenEXR. Many details on the windows version of our CI docker images are still yet to be defined and discovered. | . … more ideas go here … . ",

The information being collected is just for sorting / analysis, that part won’t be shared . | Should be sent to the VFX Platform mailing list (Daniel todo). | Ken: discussed in the TSC, all of the TSC members were complaining that there is a very long list of questions that you have to go through before you get to a specific project. Could there be a direct link that you could point to the relevant part of the survey? . | Daniel: to be discussed with Emily, can we discuss this on Slack? . | Got posted to 3D Pro . | . | Working Groups . | CI . | Discussions on CentOS stream, update on aswf-docker | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Meeting is happening concurrently, so schedule clash . | First webinar on 25th Feb . | . | Python 3 . | USD . | Cory: well attended meeting this year, discussion of delivery and visualization of USD assets with web technology. Took a look at USD Playground project (see USD-wg wiki). Will have a presentation at the next session from Roman Zulek (sp?) to look at 3D web technology for USD. Group may create a sub WG on that topic. | Had good discussion / revisited USD Camera, started a sub WG for USD camera to agree on what a typical structure for a USD camera would look like, creation of a common camera rig (lots of interest at Netflix for multi-studio projects). Will report back to USD WG in a couple of sessions. | Talked about Omniverse, now in open beta, future role of OmniVerse, may be getting a presentation on the extension mechanism for OmniVerse. | Small discussion about backlot technologies, how people are storing assets in a digital backlot, Pixar is doing that, so will try to gather some information on that topic. | Lots on the agenda for 2021! . | . | Review &amp; Approval . | Larry: there has been another meeting, continue to see 2-3 demos from relevant systems, probably one more round of “show and tell” | . | Asset Repository . | Michael: lively discussion, what should an asset repo for ASWF be, Eric had summary, “first make it easy”, check in with John about licensing. Try to make these assets to the ASWF projects as well as to the larger membership. Moana keeps coming up as an example of what we would like to see from other studios / projects. One of the suggestions would be “how could you carve out of that project things that could be of value to projects”. For instance turning this large 3D asset into USD, but could we also get a bunch of EXRs with AOVs with contemporary naming structure, types of AOVs. Also OTIO timelines. | Think about Blender content, studio content. If we got “big” assets, how we would convert those into actual assets such as OSL shaders, EXR files, OTIO cutlists, OpenVDB datasets… . | A bunch of action items, notes are being kept in the Wiki . | Cary: had exchange with WDA, Moana scene was set up to render in a single pass without a lot of AOVs, so that data isn’t readily available. The problem they have is keeping the dataset up to date, version control on these kinds of assets is not easy, is this something we could figure out? It’s way too large for GitHub (100+ GB). How can you do version control and maintenance on such assets. | Wave: Pixar uses Perforce for digital backlot, at Apple can use anything. Currently using git-lfs (Large File extension for Git). Please come to next meeting to discuss this. | Daniel: versioning problem was explicitly discussed early on in the WG. Lots of things can create the dataset to change, do you want to continuously update it, or keep it fixed for regression testing? . | . | Rust . | Daniel: there was interest in the last TAC meeting to connect with the Rust meeting? We should make space for that. | Scott: first meeting on Saturday to figure out plan for 2021. Talking about becoming a Working Group, what do we need to do to make the request. What do we want to see done before the end of the year (or sooner). | Starting with the big “where do we want to go, what do we want to be” discussions . | Kimball: doing a new C layer for OpenEXR, how can we get feedback from Rust community. | Scott: looking to create a tool to automatically create C bindings. Don’t duplicate effort. Designed for a specific project, but generic for all ASWF libraries. | Daniel: TAC supporter should be involved with Rust community (preferably?). Daniel: will try to join the meeting. Sean: happy to sponsor it as well. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | OCIO . | Michael: need testers for v2 before official release, testing activity at Autodesk and Foundry. | Version for Reference Platform 2021: want to switch OCIO version from 2.0.x to 2.x, since there are likely to be desirable minor releases this year. In particular OCIO is likely to be home for new ACES 1.3 gamut mapping (around April) . | Kimball: congrats for 2.0RC1 ! . | Daniel: does 2.x in Reference Platform mean that there should be forward / backward compatibility within that range? . | Michael: minor releases wouldn’t change any existing APIs, just add new ones (additional transform types). Would have to be careful. OpenVDB currently has their minor version as ‘x’ in Reference Platform. | Larry: doesn’t this create an issue, if you add API calls for 2.1 for instance, you no longer have forward compatibility. Unless you are committed to all the 2.x compatible in both forward / backward direction? . | Michael: good point, but there will be useful functionality that will land before end of 2021. Has this been an issue for OpenVDB? . | Ken: no, it hasn’t. Major version guarantees ABI compatibility, but can have API changes between minor versions. But have symbol versioning / namespacing to help. | Michael: also have namespacing . | Larry: 2020 VFX platform supported EXR 2.4, 2021 says 3.0, but in the meantime OpenEXR had a 2.5 release that is somewhat of an orphan release that falls between platform releases. We haven’t come to a conclusion about that. | Michael: that was discussed at OCIO, they have an OpenEXR dependency (currently 2.4), may result in a version bump for OCIO when EXR goes to 3.0? . | Daniel: could be an issue if you pass EXR images around in the API. | Michael: OCIO uses the Half library, so will be depending on imath rather than OpenEXR . | Daniel: a version that wants to call a new API won’t work with the old version. So you need to always have the newest version applicable to the VFX Reference Platform year (currently the case with OpenVDB and TBB). | Ken: the OpenVDB policy has been around for 5 years without a problem. Houdini is built against OpenVDB 6.0, then we release 6.5, so in Houdini you can do a reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt; of the grid, and can call the new APIs. It has been stable and hasn’t cause issues. But it does require care and namespacing. | . | OpenVDB . | Ken: released 8.0 2 weeks ago, Ax is the JIT language from DNeg. | Next milestone is NanoVDB: GPU friendly slimmed down version, lives in a feature branch, needs to be moved to master branch (already used by many). | Used to use cppunit for unit testing, now using ttest. Have a very small dependency on OpenEXR, but trying to limit external dependencies. Scaling back on Boost, TBB. | Using EXR core libraries for images, also use “half” a lot, will include that component of ilmBase directly. | Not getting rid of TBB, but getting rid of TBB threads. May introduce wrappers, useful since embracing GPUs, so may want to be able to do threading on the host vs GPU. | OpenVDB is 2 main components; a data structure, and a set of tools. There’s currently a blurry line between the two, a lot of the tools live as methods on the data structure. Trying to separate the two, moving these methods into tools. Helps with optimization and extending the data structure. This is a long process, started with this in 8.0 (which changed the ABI). There’s not a lot of difference between 7.2 and 8.0 (Ax was already in 7.2), but had to change the major version for ABI breakage. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: 2.5.4 release over the holiday breaks. Bugs / security fixes from the oss-fuzz reports. Did that pending the 3.0 release. | Getting closer with iMath split, but wanted to release the security fixes in a less disruptive form than the 3.0 release. | Lots to discuss at next TSC: tie up the loose ends. Kimball has started major rewrite of core I/O releases (thread friendly), but won’t be part of 3.0 release (which will be mostly an organizational change). | . | OSL . | Chris: CLA has gone through, contributors are signing it, expecting changeover to ASWF GitHub very soon. | . | OTIO . | Josh: more approvals on the Disney side for the CLA changes, some more steps required, check in with John on that topic. | OTIO is also aiming to use iMath once the separate is complete, looking forward to that, and happy to be early testers. | Discussion about storing color information, color primaries, profiles in OTIO. Will reach out to OCIO project to get some guidance to make sure we are complementary to other projects. | Made progress on CII badge, remaining outstanding issue is getting comfortable with the questions about the security process. Tentatively looking at doing some training for the team. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: not too much update, no TSC meeting this year. Doing some housekeeping, laying out priorities for this year, eagerly waiting survey results. Seeing renewed interest in finishing up CII badge process, SonarCloud. | . | Camera Raw . | adopted for incubation status at last TAC meeting, not further progress over the holidays, but will start this month | . | . | Cary: what happened to the discussion about renaming the “master” branch, we were waiting on some GitHub changes? Larry: guidance from GitHub was “wait for new tools”, but does GitHub have this in place? Daniel: there was some pushback from the broader community, if the majority of projects out there are converging to a naming convention, you would have to have a strong reason to use something else. But probably worth taking up again? Can be discussed on the #wg-ci Slack channel. | Goals for ASWF: 2021 . | What are other projects we want to start in 2021 instead of just adopting? . | Helping projects with dependencies for instance | . | Daniel: Review working group, data repository / assets are potential sources of new technical projects . | CII badging for OpenCue and OTIO are scheduled in the next 6 months, projects to graduate (Josh: yes for OTIO) . | Kimball: perhaps we could have Python scripts to manage versions . | . | Next meeting: January 27, 2021 . | .

    "content": ". | ASWF Project and Community Survey (John / Emily) . | Emily: 165 responses, supposed to close at end of the week (Feb 1st) . | Lots of feedback on how it was structured, more geared toward studios . | For next survey, hoping to be more inclusive of software vendors . | Responses so far have been good . | . | FMX . | Emily: ASWF curating an open source track, so anyone interested in presenting should send an informal abstract . | Wave: interested in putting together a short, 3 min presentation about Assets WG to generate interest / opportunity to socialize back to studios, is there a context for that? . | Larry: can include in his talk (overview of important studio open source projects) . | Emily: could also go into David Morin’s Foundation overview talk . | Wave: there may be other 2-3 min presentations from other groups . | Emily: we could create a separate talk on foundation working groups . | Larry: David’s talk might go into that as well . | Mathieu: one of the pushes this year is to grow the General Membership (represents general membership on the board). So raising awareness of general membership / plugging membership could be something worth doing at FMX. Encourage discussions within studios of general membership, especially in context of lot of studios making use of ASWF projects. Encourage “giving back”. | . | Open Source Forum: . | March 10th, each working group to present a brief 5 minute update . | Verizon and (?) will present . | HyperLedger will present . | Jim Zeller (LF CEO) will present . | Towards more exec level people . | Share at discretion with colleagues / execs who should be there . | . | Working Group updates . | CI: no meeting since last TAC meeting, notes just got merged into repo . | D&amp;I . | Carol: by end of week / early next week, should have schedule and speakers locked down for webinar series, Emily working on copy so it can be shared, we should spread within our networks . | First webinar on Feb 25th . | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: continuing to work on transition guide, another round of speaking to studios about how far they are in Python 3 conversion. Still very early days, several studios where Python 3 is more of a “grassroots effort” rather than an official program. | . | USD . | Wave: meeting on USD camera, good representation. Broke it up into a couple of parts: camera based on a physical rig, other part on the physically based camera optics, tracking, metadata that you would get from a live action shoot, how would you track that metadata through a CG pipeline. Handed out “homework assignments”, what would a USD hierarchy look like. Also looking at sensor, camera lens metadata. | Corey: will get update next session from Camera. Working on web delivery of USD assets using WebRTC, there’s a video to share, video size is too large for the Wiki. What about YouTube, do we need to clear with any presenters? Should come out shortly. | In upcoming sessions, will try to edit presentations out of Zoom calls. | Roman Zulak presentation, 3 or 4 different parties working on projects in this space (USD web delivery), is it worth creating a sub WG for this specific topic? . | . | Asset Group . | Wave: presentation to the board . | Trying to build OTIO timeline (reached out to OTIO) . | Talking to Disney about Moana to leverage the asset, USD version coming soon . | Discussions on licensing, John + LF lawyer shared some info, it’s complicated . | Reaching out to Camera manufacturers to see if we can get production footage from them . | Discussion about keeping the recipe for an asset around instead of a “backed good”: Moana asset is very large, does Disney want to continue to host it? Turns out it’s more of a “working document” than expected, do you really want to regenerate a 150GB asset every time you make a fix / change, or a set of pieces you can download, and a recipe / Python script to regenerate the full asset . | . | Rust Saturday . | Sean: meeting went well, lot of energy and enthusiasm around Rust for the projects we oversee, as well as other ideas . | Notes are posted to Rust Slack channel . | Next step is to fill out the WG template so we can present a vote to the TAC, targeting next TAC meeting for a proposal vote, establish the goals of the WG . | In parallel lots of other work being done, working on bindings . | Next meeting in 2 days . | . | WG status and approvals . | Need to access goals / non goals of various WGs, getting all the details right . | Wave: discussed, seems not trivial . | Sean: came up in Rust meeting, lots of different opinions. Scott taking the lead in distilling down to a set of goals / non goals . | Kimball: we want to maintain a sense of engagement / excitement . | . | . | Technical Project updates . | OSL . | Chris: we have CLAs signed by all major parties, move the repo to the ASWF GitHub organization, which is a big step | . | OpenCue . | Brian: update from last TSC meeting, as part of drive to make OpenCue easier to deploy, starting to coordinate an effort between cloud providers and people who run infrastructure, putting together docs and scripts, for instance using Terraform. Please reach out to Brian to help work on publishing this information, and do a PR push on mailing list. | . | OCIO . | Michael: from last TAC meeting, changing of changing version in VFX Reference Platform, decided not to do it, staying with 2.0.x, makes more sense / safer . | Plan on pushing v2 tag within next 24h, 3 years of work just about done. Exciting to finally get that out there. | Agreed to work towards changing CCLA over to the ASWF standard to be consistent with other projects. Not doing it yet since in support mode for new v2 release, but looking to do this in next couple of months. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: switched over to the new CLA . | Working towards 3.0 release and imath, nothing like being “really close” to realize how much is left to do. Chipping away at it, release should be soon . | . | OpenVDB, OTIO . | No representatives | . | RAW2aces . | Kimball: need to have meeting with ACES | . | . | Goals for ASWF: 2021 redux . | D&amp;I: Adobe . | Bill Roberts: push for D&amp;I at Adobe (with Van Bedient) . | 10 minute summary . | Kimball: ASWF has lots of projects / building blocks, but our group should figure out how to put these building blocks together so we can enable other communities to do interesting things. New projects that could reach out to newer generations to get them interested in M&amp;E? . | Adobe For All: how can we give back . | Want to be agent of change beyond the company . | Brought in guest speakers: Dr Gregory Carr, Nikole Hannah-Jones (1619 NY Times project) . | Adobe allows employees to spend time on projects . | Community . | Growth &amp; Advancement . | Hiring &amp; Recruiting . | Responsibility &amp; Advocacy . | Transparency &amp; Governance . | . | Responsibility &amp; Advocacy: trying to target 13-18 age bracket, people who are “selecting out” of technical or artistic tracks due to lack of representation. Providing software and hardware to help. | Creating a framework that can be shared with others. | Core Principles - Open Source Framework . | There is no “winning” - only getting to what is right and fair as quickly as possible - for all . | We need to move entire industries: . | Photography and Imaging . | Design . | Video . | 3D and Interactive . | Other? . | . | . | Adobe Contributions . | Open Source repositories of areas of focus . | Great response from other manufacturers . | . | Model to drive adoption across creative industries . | Interested organizations (creative tools, content creators, industry organizations) | . | Next Steps: . | Feedback: Socialize and solicit input - internal and external to Adobe . | Consolidation: look for similar programs - integrate, align or include . | Roll Out: prepare the first repository and roll out . | Inspect &amp; Adapt: report out (quarterly and annually), modify per inputs . | . | Kimball: there’s clear crossover with our own D&amp;I initiatives, what ideas can we come up with . | Carol: want to work together and be aligned, doesn’t necessarily need to happen as a direct part of the WG, but could be a separate ASWF project that the D&amp;I WG could contribute and profit from . | Kimball: software doesn’t have to be code, it can be web sites to help people communicate for instance. | We can bring this up at next TAC group, think of ideas / projects that could fit, get our companies to contribute. | Larry: Bill, do you have a slide deck you could share, also for the other groups and categories? Bill: yes, but have to clear what can be shared first. Applying Agile methodologies to what they want to achieve, should be able to share more soon. | . | Google Summer of Code . | Larry: deadline is coming up soon, we need to have an application finalized in next 3-4 weeks if we want to do this again . | Google has changed the program, estimated number of hours cut in half (and stipend). “Worthwhile” projects where students could have a real accomplishment to point to seemed to already be on the edge of what an undergrad could do in 12 weeks, so before we make an application, asking project leads whether they have project ideas that could be done in 6 weeks. If we have the right projects, we can do an application, but otherwise we can skip it. | Kimball: if Google is cutting things in half, should we push for our own program? Carol: the current plan is to do that, we got budget approved for our version of inclusion-based summer internship (3 @ $6K each, this isn’t set in stone for now). Based on experience from GSoC last summer. | Emily: starting with 3 this year, can expand to more next year. If there are more projects that want a full length student, could ask for more budget. | Wave: Academy Sci-Tech may have other internship programs, for instance production-based projects (rather than code). Also we don’t necessarily have to do it in the summer (currently leading a “spring intern”). Carol: is this the Academy Gold program? D&amp;I group working on trying to link up with Academy efforts. | Carol: efforts don’t have to be mutually exclusive, but if projects feel that a “full time intern” is more productive, they want to hear that feedback. | Larry: we don’t need to organize these efforts completely separately, we can think of it as “funding from different places”, between different programs, we have a set of resources to meet both D&amp;I and technical goals. | Kimball: we should probably still target GSoC for smaller projects . | Larry: talked to GSoC organizers, “the program doesn’t exist for the project but for the students”, so they felt they could reach out to more students, want to allow more students to “dip their toes” into participating to open source projects, rather than targeting larger contributions to those projects. They will try this for a year or 2 and adjust accordingly. For many open source projects, it’s probably a boon, our specialized projects which require specialist knowledge may benefit less from shorter involvements. | Kimball: what kind of contributions are they accepting? Cary/ Larry: has to be code, can’t be documentation, assets. Kimball: could it be regression testing? Larry: as long as the primary deliverable has to be code. They have a corresponding “Season of Doc” program for non-code contributions, which we could also look at. | Larry: still targets college / university level students, in general terms, looking to give more people opportunities, even if these are shallower . | . | New Projects? . | . | Next meeting . | 10 Feb 2021 . | Likely will have a proposal from Rust . | Wave: WG may also have proposal . | . | .

    "content": ". | General Easy-CLA Upgrade Announcement (John) . | LF team getting ready for a major upgrade, v1 to v2 in the near future . | If you are a contributor, should not see any changes . | If you are one of the managers for the organization (who is granted under the CCLA), there will be a webinar in the next week or 2 outlining the changes, how to use the tool . | If you see any issues, please let us know / file tickets with LF support . | Michael: could there be a one CCLA manager for the organization across multiple projects / one for the whole ASWF? John: the issue is more a legal issue since each project is in a different legal entity, and the CLAs have specific language referring to the specific project. Closest we’ve gotten to has been to keep the terms as identical as possible between projects, but difficult to have a single CLA across entities. | Michael: if a company has contributors across 3 projects, would be easier if the language was identical, but sounds like the answer is no. | John: may be a different question, worth raising with the CCLA team. | Daniel: when we have questions about process, is the ticketing system the right way to find the point of contact within LF? John: if there are direct issues with the tools (access, bugs), then ticketing system is the right answer. If it’s more questions about the CLA itself, probably best to reach to John directly. | Some projects still working on moving to the 2020 V2.1 CLA . | . | Upcoming Events . | Kimball: thank you Emily for all your work! Emily: I’ve really enjoyed working with ASWF over the last 2 years, proud of what we’ve accomplished. Have been part of many communities, this is one of the most active and engaged. Heading to enterprise tech company, not in the M&amp;E space. Will still be part of some D&amp;I meetings. | FMX . | Thank you for everyone who submitted submissions. Last day is Friday, will be connecting with the FMX people. Jam packed with great content. | . | Open Source Forum . | John will take the lead to send the invites for that | . | ASWF: Survey results have just been sent . | . | Google Summer of Code (Larry) . | Application deadline coming up . | Larry: deadline before the next TAC meeting, wanted to share update. OCIO has said they would like to do it, OTIO said no, OSL is going through the motions to see if they have any ideas, haven’t heard from other projects. If we don’t hear from a couple of other projects, then we will likely not make an ASWF application (OCIO could make its own application). | Michael: could OCIO do it under the ASWF organization to help with continuity? Larry: seems odd to do it under the organization if only one project is ready to submit under the new task size rules. | Michael: just curious, last year there was some language about being a “first time organization”. Larry: could explain that you are part of an org that has done it before. | Deadline is the 20th. Kimball: will talk about it in OpenEXR TSC . | Josh: OTIO had great experience last year, only issue this year is lack of bandwidth. Encourage other projects to do it. | . | Project Updates . | Technical Project updates . | OSL . | Chris: no big updates, move to ASWF GitHub org has gone OK, lots of activity on the GPU front, execution on CPUs. | . | OpenCue . | OCIO . | Michael: official announcement of v2 release, getting good feedback, implementation in studios and DCCs . | UX WG, representatives from studios and users, how can we create a consistent experience for users . | GSoC: looking for projects that fit the shorter timeframe. Also looking at projects for D&amp;I fellowship. Looking at implementing OCIO in ffmpeg, some updates to ffmpeg may have improved ability to get FP data from buffers. Also a set of OFX OCIO plugins to stand as examples. Larry: could propose to the ffmpeg group and volunteer to help mentor it. Michael: good point. Daniel: great to hear that documentation WG has come full circle. Were discussing the experience of “spinning out” a project WG for documentation. Michael: still on the radar, want to address. Continuing to improve documentation. Daniel: would it be possible to point towards the infrastructure that has been set up? Michael: could do that, have had some contact with other projects that have been referencing it. Kimball: OpenEXR adopting some of those practices, thank you for doing the heavy lifting to organize. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: keep inching towards 3.0 release, “dot is and cross ts”, fleshing out details. Waiting for legal approval from one of the contributors, we want to include that change, but their legal dept is moving slowly. No set date yet, but “soon”. | . | OpenVDB . | OTIO . | Josh: still working on graduation next steps, some good collaboration with assets WG, some leads on the Blender foundation donating assets | . | RAW2aces . | Kimball: Emailed to get a TSC started | . | . | Working Group updates . | CI . | Daniel: Working on formalizing the structure of the WG but haven’t finished. CI WG proposal Ongoing work on upgrade for VFX Platform 2021, OpenEXR 3. Practical discussions on how to manage the increasingly constrained Docker images (new policies on Docker Hub), but for internal projects and external users (bandwidth throttling). | Also working on Mac builds, especially for the M1 hardware support, should get easier. No strong demand for that yet. | Package management: Ryan’s demo from Sony Imageworks, a stream of activity, next meeting from Jeff Bradley at Dreamworks as to their efforts. | . | D&amp;I . | Carol: just had monthly D&amp;I meeting (12PM Pacific just before TAC). | Career in Film Tech webinar series announcement, everyone is encouraged to share with their networks. | Accompanied with smaller University led webinars (basics of Open Source contribution), partnering with specific universities. Won’t be as widely advertised. Anyone interested in this accompanying content can reach out. | Moving on to scholarship, internship and project ambassador initiatives . | . | Python 3 . | USD . | Cory: great meeting, kicking off new WG to look at web delivery of USD content for visualization, looking at proposal for SIGGRAPH panel . | Report back from early meetings of USD Camera WG, lots of interest / excitement, no specific output yet. | Michael Min: good conversations on USD camera, schemas should be presented at next meeting on Monday . | Lull in presentation scheduling, trying to get engineers from Pixar to present on how USD is used for Digital Backlot, working on presentation for SIGGRAPH, may happen next week . | . | Asset Group . | Wave: made progress towards clarifying what recommendations to the TAC will be, should finish this at the next meeting. Talked about discussing on Slack, but hasn’t happened so far. Please check out the Wiki that has the notes for the various meetings, as well as the Slack channel. | . | Rust . | Has there been a proposal? Sean Looper: Rust WG Proposal . | Rust Slack channel has a lot of activity . | Goals of the WG are: . | To collaborate with ASWF communities to create (or facilitate the creation of) C and Rust bindings which are consistent across projects. | Create tooling to help build the C and Rust bindings. | Define a set of conventions and rules to create a consistent and ergonomic C and Rust interface for the wrapped libraries. | To have the Rust bindings easily accessible through Rust’s crates.io repository, and to give ownership of those bindings to the ASWF. | . | Non-goals of the WG are: . | Re-implementing current C++ libraries in Rust . | In some cases it may make sense: Imath / half type, but in general no plans to re-implement . | . | Deliverables . | Bind Imath and OpenEXR with C and Rust bindings by SIGRAPH . | Create a framework for binding the other libraries . | Kimball: how would these be maintained, in the same repo/ project or separately? How do they get managed? Scott: not sure that we have a clear understanding for that yet, whether the Rust group would manage the bindings themselves, or give the tools to the upstream project to easily manage these bindings. Can work with the project to decide what makes the most sense. Sean: would be concerned (scalability) by an approach where the ownership of the bindings would be centralized. | Daniel: in favor, great to see energy and enthusiasm. Sean: very happy with the goals. Kimball: should we bring this to a vote? . | John: is there a motion? Sean: move a motion, Daniel seconds. | Vote: all ayes, no nays or abstain, Rust WG motion passes. | . | What is next for CI? . | Daniel: makes sense to split out the WG from its direct “under the TAC” (repo) and its charter doc . | Great to check in with TAc and projects as to agreement with focus, or should CI concentrate in other areas? . | Some of this could be folded into the charter template . | Kimball: should it be a formal project or not? Is there any code / scripts? (aswf-docker) . | Daniel: we have a set of organizations / users at the root owned by the ASWF (systems and artifacts used by the CI system). Kimball: are there recipes that should be published to help people build their own Docker images? Daniel: there’s the aswf-docker repo with the recipes used to generate images. | Daniel: making the CI WG a “formal” WG would be a step to make it more visible, including making its own project under the ASWF organization. | Daniel: will take this to the next CI meeting, does it make sense to become an actual ASWF project, or stay as a WG . | . | Michael Min: Could we perhaps discuss Open Asset Model next TAC meeting, and see if it’s something that might apply to the various working groups? Link? . | Early discussions about the Open Asset Model from Autodesk, would be great to get some presentation by Autodesk. Number of projects could benefit from their efforts, maybe speak about this at next TAC meeting? | . | Emily: there was a question in the survey results about documentation, but it doesn’t mention which project, so may want to ignore that answer. Should be available later today / tomorrow morning. | . | Next meeting . | 24 Feb 2021 | . | . ",

Brian: “the last 10% took a long time!” . | . | OCIO . | Michael: talking about ASWF survey at last meeting, how to follow up with people who wanted to contribute to the project . | Moving meeting notes out of the repo and into the ASWF wiki, lower noise in repo. | Carol Payne: applied to GSoC as an independent project, waiting for updates . | . | OpenEXR . | Close to ready for a release, but still some cleanup issues. One of the Linux distro package managers has been finding some issues here and there, glad that got done before a release. Otherwise would have been scrambling to fix issues after public announcement. | Originally said next week for the release, but that’s probably not going to happen. But should have beta release before Open Source Forum. | Larry: all of our CI tests with the ASWF docker containers are careful to have only one version of dependencies installed, so downstream projects can fail to notice that they have OpenEXR 2.0 installed while wanting to test with EXR 3.0 (order of include files…). Can be tricky, and will be good to have a beta. | Cary: complexity about generating bindings for Python 2 and 3 at the same time. Driving the desire for simplicity. | Kimball: time to deprecate the Python 2 bindings… . | Larry: just deleting the old versions is not a good general purpose approach. Still working out the details. Challenging to get the downstream CMake build systems to get the include in the right / desired order. | Kimball: is there general knowledge to be derived, for instance the transition to OCIO 2.0 . | Cary: our CI is testing against an artificially simplistic environment. | . | OpenVDB . | No representative present | . | OTIO . | Josh: meeting tomorrow to look at TSC charger and move forward, have all the right approvals to move . | Continuing work on CII badge . | Just turned on CI across Linux/Windows/macOS, uncovered some issues, but largely pretty smooth. Gives us confidence that we’ll get more testing across Python flavors and platforms. | Lots of feedback about “why does this not install on Windows”, hopefully the CI will help with that. | Hoping to use that to draw in more contributors who use Windows primarily . | Splitting some pieces of OTIO repo into separate repos, separating language bindings and adapters / plugins into separate repos, to make it clear what the core project is responsible for, whereas other components can trail a bit, and that you can chose which components of OTIO you want to install. | Other studios are starting to create specific plugins (for instance for Hiero) that doesn’t necessarily fit into the core repo. So there’s now a “plugin template” that helps with that. | . | RAW2aces . | Kimball: pre-TSC meeting, trying to identify other people who can be involved. Discussions about re-licensing the code, splitting the repo to make clear what is data and what is code (helps with licensing) | . | . | Working Group updates . | CI . | No meeting since last TAC meeting . | Next meet agenda: moving to a project format to have more access/ visibility in CI efforts . | CI group could look into the issues reported by Larry about dependencies . | . | D&amp;I . | Carol: first webinar happening tomorrow, second one the week after, then every 2 weeks. 7 in total . | Although not target audience, everyone is welcome to attend to give feedback . | Next effort will be scholarship and ambassador programs . | . | Python 3 . | USD . | Cory: Setting up a series of demos, including Pixar Backlot . | Mike M: USD Camera Workgroup discussing schemas, creating Requirements Doc . | . | Asset Group . | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuxNSlV6fS_3km6QlwA5Z9oBhNgx_NlhZjV2jg2DrFg/edit#heading=h.4ybh7vyxdywk . | Wave: Trying to communicate with the TAC what we have been working on for the last few months . | Not going for “quantity”, going for quality. Going for production level assets, ideally from a production setting, not artificial, although have talked about one way of having an asset repo could be code that generates a sequence of OpenVDB / OpenEXR files (for instance generate EXRs with a bunch of AOVs from a 3D scene). | An organizing principle is that there should be strong alignment with the actual ASWF projects, and should either be consumed by or generated by ASWF projects. Bias towards assets that can be used by as many parts of the ASWF as possible, as well as ASWF members such as software vendors who can use these assets for their own use. | Not targeting “educational” assets for now, instead going for complex, production grade assets. | Not a “digital backlot”, not a repository of digital assets to be used in production, that already exists (both public and private repositories) . | Kimball: was there a discussion about a goal to help how to get contributions to this repo, such as listing the steps that were required for licensing / legal buyoff? Wave: yes, strawman proposal by Eric Enderton. “Make it easy for organizations to submit assets”, could be an issue if too many proposals come. Talked to Nick Cannon at WDI about the process of the Moana Island asset. The long time to produce a USD version of this asset demonstrates how complex the process can be. | There were suggestions such as camera manufacturers shooting HDR footage, talking to the ASC (suggestion at board meeting yesterday), they have a library of digital assets. But are we “a list of pointers to assets hosted somewhere else”, “a clone of existing libraries”, or “the primary hosting location”? . | TAC Project representatives should suggest what assets would be useful to their project. | Making it useful: will require people and resources. Orca is a library that NVIDIA has and makes available to researchers. Presentation from NVIDIA as to how much work is required to clean up and make assets usable. | Need a “pipeline TD” to do this work, could be a GSoC-like position? Looking at what the D&amp;I team is putting together in terms of outreach programs, could we get funding to get some kind of internship, minimal code writing (maybe some Python), but still useful project. | Trying to put together a curated set of production grade assets that would be directly useful to the projects and ASWF membership. Not targeting educational assets. Do whatever can be done to make easy for licensing and hosting. Make it clear what is desired as contributions. Asking for TAC members about opinions of what they want as assets, a wish list of “assets you with you had”. | Gordon: being able to test DCCs against these assets would be very useful. One of the things vendors find difficult is finding assets they can demo in their videos / promotional material. | Blender is working on a new short film, OTIO would like to get cuts and media, they already have pretty permissive license. | RV / Shotgun was using Big Buck Bunny as demo material for a long time. | Kimball: did we learn anything from Blender’s tutorial assets? Wave: it’s more interesting to get a dirty / crufty production asset at the end of a movie with all sorts of typical leftover “detritus” in the asset, as opposed to a carefully crafted asset for tutorial purposes. DCC vendors probably want to test against “crufty” production assets. | Josh: having assets that are clear to include in demos and presentations is really important, as opposed to just “for testing only” assets. It’s a real pain to get approval to use assets for demos. It would be very beneficial. | Josh: we also need to recognize that large studios may not want to release assets that have valuable IP associated to them . | Kimball: if ASC is working on a new STeM, we should provide that feedback to them . | Wave: multiple ways to achieve that, we could have a website that points where to find this, we could have a badging system to indicate “production level assets”, that could be the answer if we can’t actually host ourselves. But if Disney made Moana available, it is possible! . | Michael Min: early discussions motivated by Autodesk for an Asset Model, would like another 2 weeks to consolidate. Gordon: will have people working on this proposal present at the next meeting. Not meant to be an asset / library repository, but more a schema to structure asset above the raw geometry. An interesting question: what is the opportunity / overlap / relationship between that work and the asset WG work. | Wave: Intel and Amazon have a number of assets they are interested in contributing. | Wave: this is a WG, not a project, so it has a limited scope. Suggestion would be to wait until the Autodesk presentation, people will have an opportunity to comment. Can present at next TAC meeting to vote, not super clear on what the outcome should be. Need to hear from TAC members. | Eric: if the TAC approves the proposal, can present to the board, and request resources. Do we want to launch an asset repo project, derived from the work of the WG. | Open Asset Model (OAM) schema hasn’t been presented yet. | Gordon: is there some intermediate goals that can be carved out before going to the governing board. Are there some questions that can be answered before that? Wave: organize the assets by ASWF project, a clear way to organize it. Drifted a bit from that towards assets like Moana that don’t neatly fit into a single project, but could work across them. “What do we want in an ASWF asset repository”, come up with a wishlist, and “Are there any assets in ASWF member companies that could be contributed”. Also are there “recipes” that can be contributed (for instance Intel has code to generate OpenVDB test assets), doesn’t have legal / licensing issues since the assets weren’t used in a movie. | Gordon: something to be said about real production assets. We also don’t need permission to create a static site with links pointing to existing assets out there. Could we get to a real agreement that studios could sign? . | Wave: yes, that’s the first deliverable. | Eric: first thing that got agreed to in the discussions. Wave: goes back to “go back to your facilities and ask what you might agree to”. | Kimball: is there something we should vote on today? Wave: let’s let people to read the proposal, come back in 2 weeks to vote on something. | Eric: also on the Slack channel. | Gordon: OAM presentation to TAC, Kimball: will add to next agenda . | . | Rust . | First meeting as WG last Friday . | Creating Rust crates, cargo index, looking at transferring ownership to ASWF . | Cppmm should automatically C and Rust bindings . | Next meeting in two weeks: goal is to have OpenEXR have as complete bindings as possible (meeting cadence once a month) . | Larry: where does the tooling status lies? Scott: creating bindings for OpenEXR / imath is the immediate goal, tooling is mostly done. Should have automatic tooling in place. | Kimball: have a pending PR for a C library for OpenEXR . | Scott: won’t generate the C bindings for OpenEXR to avoid duplication of effort, but perhaps the tooling might help . | Kimball: C bindings will be the underlying infrastructure. C++ will be on top. | Scott: Trying to figure out how to organize ourselves . | . | . | Open Asset Model (mmin) . | Note: We’d like to delay discussing this to the next TAC meeting | . | Next meeting . | 10 March 2021 | . | .

Kimball: 2012, so 10 years . | A big reorganization . | . | Open Cue Graduation Proposal (Brian) . | Open Source Forum Recap and discussion (Kimball / John) . | 85 registrations, 55 attending, recordings on YouTube . | ASWF Open Source Forum 2021 Poll Results . | Attendee survey, not a lot of response (please complete if you attended) . | State of the Union was well received. | Missing aspect of networking within virtual events, every community / event continues to struggle with this. Some interesting concepts, have been looking at some options. Maybe to be addressed for Open Source Days this summer. Would make sense for a smaller event geared towards networking. | Kimball: no one said it was “a waste of time”, all projects and wgs were well received. “We’re talking about the right kind of things” . | Morning half was more attended than afternoon. | Poll: USD / MaterialX are at the top of list that should be onboarded, but surprising third place was “linux distro” . | Seemed like there was some confusion from attendees as to whether MaterialX was open source or not (it is) . | Should we start a working group on a Linux distro? Daniel: this has been an issue for the VFX Platform, this is motivated by the end of “traditional” CentOS which was unofficially the basis for the VFX Platform? Kimball: should we even be looking into this is the first question. Could we benefit as an industry to have our own Wayland server so we have better access to the GPU for direct rendering? Wave: a Docker container with all the prerequisites is already a struggle, a full Linux distro is an order of magnitude (or two) more complexity. Kimball: we wouldn’t try to do it ourselves, like the Arch Linux distro, but they have rolling releases as well. But we could define a snapshot of that? Larry: even with a snapshot, the work to follow the 1000s of packages would be huge, security updates… John: conversation about Desktop Linux, are upstream contributions part of the discussion, or just “assembling a distro”? Kimball: there is a Linux version of Unreal, it runs, but the Unreal editor doesn’t work very well compared to Windows for instance, would Unreal on Linux be helped with better low level access to GPU? Alex F: is the objective to create a Linux distro for the motion picture industry, or just provide a common set of package versions for ASWF projects? Daniel: people really want the “out of the box” workstation setup experience from CentOS, long term support via the RedHat upstream, security fixes, erroring on the side of long term stability while still able for third party vendors to push updates. CI is somewhat of a “solved” problem on Linux with containers, but not necessary for runtime on workstations (some experimental work at Animal Logic, Dreamworks). But this builds on top of CentOS distros. Alex F: so an effort to replace what goes away with Centos. Scott W: a big challenge for pipeline TDs has been updating things like OIIO, trying to get all packages happy with specific version of Maya, Nuke Houdini, if we were to look at making a Linux distro, would want to be able to “yum install oiio-python”, that would be hugely helpful, but a hard problem to solve. Kimball: received email from Nick Cannon from VES Reference Platform to preset at next TAC meeting, need to take legacy VFX Platform into consideration. HPC industry is in the same boat. John: LF has a project in the HPC space. Scientific Linux merged into CentOS many years ago. Similar industries are in the same situation. JF: also don’t want to stray too far from what storage, networking vendors support. Daniel: parallel available of different versions of DSOs has long been an issue, vendors distribute their own libraries to make their apps self contained, but hinders build systems. Brings us to domain specific package management system. A separate discussion about “how do we contribute to Linux to make it a better platform for our use cases”, and that’s been a sorely neglected area. We haven’t contributed much, apart from a few patches to Qt for instance. For instance Wayland improvement, better support for color management, HDR on the desktop… Eric: vendors like NVIDIA may not be enthusiastic about supporting a wildly different kernel / distro. Mark V: installing any new software came with requirements for specific NVIDIA driver versions, specific package / library versions (compat-XXX). Having the stable base that everyone can target, and an official “film repo” that has all these compatibility packages would be better than the “tribal knowledge” of how to make this all work. | Joshua: should we have some representation on one of the other distro efforts? . | Kimball: Ubuntu is a viable alternative. Should the Reference Platform consider basing itself on Ubuntu LTS? . | Daniel: is that the best answer, can we push this back to the VFX Reference Platform? Addressing the change of status of CentOS is a critical issue. ASWF could ask as a funnel to contribute info back to Reference Platform. Kimball: Reference Platform to present at next TAC meeting. | Kimball: quick poll: . | Should we start a WG on Linux Distro . | Consensus seems to be we shouldn’t try to create a Linux distro. | . | Should we start a WG on package management . | Daniel: this has been in the realm of the CI WG so far, should we encourage people to be involved in current efforts, vs starting a new effort? Larry: CI WG has not just been about CI for a long time, it has grown to encompass other software engineering issues such as package management. | Kimball: don’t necessarily want to add another working group, but may want to refocus the CI WG to focus on a package repository? . | . | . | . | WG Reviews . | Kimball: we should review the status of our Working Groups . | Should also review the projects . | Every few meetings we should pick a WG (or a project) and discuss in greater depth. Also decide at what point we should close off a WG and reorient efforts if needed. | Does this sound like a good idea? . | Brian: yes, this sounds good. Eric: is OK with quick updates we’ve been doing. | Eric: WG leadership would need time to prepare for this. | Next meeting we could do a deep dive on OpenCue since they just submitted their graduation. Good to revisit. | Daniel: WG charter is that some WGs are supposed to produce specific outputs in a specific timeframe. WGs shouldn’t necessarily live forever. | . | Asset WG (Wave) . | Looking at a “minimal” license we can offer to people who want to donate an asset, it is on the Wiki. Asking for comments, bring the license to your company’s lawyers, and see if that would work for your organization if you wanted to donate an asset. | Also important: would this license allow you to use an asset that falls under this license. The license has to work both way: donation and consumption. | ASWF Asset Repo Draft License . | Also picking an existing license vs making a new one . | Eric: want to be able to benchmarks / marketing with an asset, but not “make a movie” with the asset. Moana used the BSD 4 clause and added those restrictions, broadened that for the asset repo. | John: could be interesting to run this by legal committee. Wave: yes, please follow up directly. Would be great to “not introduce another open source license”, but there may be reasons to. | Daniel: Creative Commons style licenses are probably most suitable here, under Australian copyright law, there are specific, different rights for assets. This kind of specificity seems like what we are looking for here, rather than in the software license world. Wave: “we are not lawyers”, and “all of us have lawyers”, so shopping around the Moana license to our company lawyers seemed like the fastest way to go there, but could also pick the “closest” CC license. Joshua: most CC licenses specifically require attribution, but for instance the Moana license explicitly says you can’t attribute to Disney. Also the term “non commercial” is vague. Eric: we want the assets to be usable commercially. Joshua: a lot of the existing assets have “no commercial use” restrictions. Larry: suggested license is a very small edit on the Moana license, has been accepted by a lot of our companies already, and it came from Disney which typically has some of the most stringent requirements. Even an established license from the outside world may be new to our respective companies. | . | Slack crisis (Larry) . | 10K limit on messages is being a real issue . | At beginning of Feb, the 10K “deletion” horizon was August, deletion horizon is now January. Seems like there’s a lot of traffic is DMs, but also a lot of traffic that doesn’t really have to do with our projects. | We should move the non-project to a different Slack instance, pick another platform, or pay for a paid instance. | We should associate a cost. Carol: we need to be careful about the separation of conversations if our goal is inclusion. | John: LF is putting a Slack alternative based on Matrix, looking to do a POC, have been pinging the team, could ASWF be on this Matrix PoC? No new charge to the project, would be covered by “IT Services Provided”. The issue with paying for Slack is that it’s a variable cost, the more successful you are, the more expensive it gets. | Wave: running yet another chat client is an issue . | Alex F: looked at same issue on ACES, the open ended pay structure made it a non starter. Ended up using Rocket Chat, has pros and cons, but have fixed costs. | . | TAC guidance on VFX Platform sunset dates, etc. (Larry) . | Let’s make sure to address this at the next TAC if Reference Platform is presenting, every project wants to know how many years they should support. Also things not in Reference Platform we would want to address. Daniel: should we present survey results that are related to this issue, and present those results to Reference Platform? Larry: looking at survey result, the results seemed ambiguous. Was hoping to see a consensus as to whether people wanted support for previous years or not. Trying to reduce the build matrix. Could be pushed back to the CI WG, since they are at front and center of grappling with this problem (should be renamed the “everything build related” group?). | Daniel: people will stick with what they are doing until they are forced otherwise. Picking a number (“we support 3 versions back”) and see how much pushback could be a valid approach. Kimball: how far back do we have to backport security issues is a driver. Larry: these are two separate questions. For instance with OpenEXR, there are 2 overlapping but separate problems. How many versions back of OpenEXR do we support (especially for security problems), and how many years back of Reference Platform should we keep the current version of OpenEXR to support building? Kimball: if a year of Reference Platform specifies OpenEXR 2.4, should we care if you can build OpenEXR 3 in that environment? More cross-project guidance in this project would be important. | . | .

    "content": ". | Slack Crisis? . | From last week, hitting the 10K message limit . | Brought up by Larry . | Looking at what Linux Foundation would do with other projects, investigating another solution, Matrix . | Andy has been looking at getting ASWF into PoC, can we invite team to present at next TAC meeting? Andy: yes, we can invite them. | Status: ASWF is an option for LF PoC, but needs to be presented . | Larry: do we even know that? Can we just set up an instance to try out? . | Andrew: setting up a single Matrix instance to be offered to LF project, need to see how much load it can handle, so need to onboard projects in a controlled way. Not looking at how to handle users in China (due to firewall issues). Looking at standing up a federated China-specific Matrix instance. Down the line, looking how to federate to other Matrix instances, and how to bridge into other protocols (Slack, IRC…). | Some services will be offered free to projects, some charges for specific features, although ASWF may already be in tier that would get us the all the features (TBD) . | Matrix team confirms will be able to present at next TAC meeting . | Larry: 2 / 3 to 3 / 4 of our quota is Direct Messages, so automatically generated public channels are not a huge contributor / drop in a bucket . | Rachel: still open to paying for Slack? Kimball / Andrew: Matrix will be a fixed cost (Slack is expensive when pricing around number of messages / users). Kimball: can we transfer membership from Slack to Matrix? . | Larry: many of use have multiple Workspaces in Slack, so splitting into multiple workspaces is not that big a deal. | Wave: yet another desktop IM client is also an issue . | . | VFX Reference Platform Guest Speaker Discussion (Francois / Nick / JF?) . | NickC: Sunset Dates, other things, how better to collaborate . | Preview of VFX Platform 2022 . | Qt5 / Qt 6 . | How to better collaborate between TAC and VFX Reference Platform . | CY2022 Preview for ASWF TAC . | macOS: minimal is 10.15 (was 10.13) . | Windows: Minimum platform toolset VS 2019 (was VS 2017) . | Python 3.9.x (was 3.7.x) . | NymPy: 1.20.x (wa 1.19.x) . | OpenEXR 3.0.x (was 2.4.x) . | OpenVDB 9.0.x (if released) . | Boost 1.75 (was 1.73) . | Intel TBB: 2020 Update 3 (was 2020 Update 2) . | Intel MKTL 2021 (was 2020) . | Will only put in the platform things that are already released (missed the delay in OpenEXR 3.0 release for 2021) . | No change on compiler, C++ 17, Qt (too much work to go to Qt 6) . | . | Kimball: we should have fallen back to OpenEXR 2.5 (which was released) instead of 2.4, how to better collaborate . | NickC: software vendors made the call to stay on 2.4, issues with QA window where they are locked into versions. Schedule allows them to do the development and QA before release . | Kimball: better collaboration should help . | NickC: different release schedules between commercial products, open source libraries are a channel. Maybe ASWF projects can have a release cadence that can make it easier to sync up with the platform and make sure the platform represents the current versions, want to encourage the community to stay current with latest work. | Cary: challenge to keep a finger on the pulse of the user community and keep track of what the community is using. VFX Platform can provide information on some of the major consumers of these libraries. Francois: biggest challenge is to get info from users in studios, or vendors? The Platform is for Software Vendors, studios can also use it as well. VFX Platform isn’t meant to be prescriptive for the studios, more for the vendors. Cary: users are free to use whatever version they want, OpenEXR would argue there’s no reason to stick with 2.4 since 2.5 has no breaking changes, just bug / security fixes. Criteria used to bump 2.4 to 2.5 may have been over conservative, without full understanding of downstream consequences. | NickC: Platform has WG, 2 reps from VES Tech (Francois/Nick), 2 each from Foundry, SideFX and Autodesk. feedback@vfxplatform.com as well as public mailing list: build engineering community, low traffic. Process starts in January, quick first past. Answer “what’s current?”, then WG discussions to figure out how much work is involved in moving to latest versions. Different tradeoffs are considered within the WG. Broaden discussion in May. | Cary: this better understanding of the VFX Reference Platform release process would have helped make better decisions. | Francois: Sept 1st is the decision point after the SIGGRAPH BoF discussion, give 4 months for vendors to do testing / QA, in time for a January release. Have made exceptions with OpenVDB which traditionally releases in Early Oct, vendors were OK with it. | Can always make exceptions if there is consensus, sometimes even in the middle of the year if it won’t lead to compatibility issues. But target is Sept 1st . | NickP: what’s the expectation of support for previous years of support? An issue for OTIO due to having to maintain Python wheels for old versions. Do we still need to support CY2015? . | NickC: there hasn’t been an explicit expectation set, was previously brought up by Larry. Larry: as a practical matter, it leaves everyone hanging if we don’t know this. NickC: VFX Platform can look at providing that guidance, on the website there are archived and current versions. So we could state that anything archived is no guarantee. In studios, some projects can go on for 3-4 years and require locking of versions. So we need to figure out what’s an appropriate window of support. | Larry: two considerations: format support, and CI / build infrastructure. | NickP: there’s an expectation that pip “just works”, and that’s hard to support to figure out what version of VFX Platform. Blender users “pip install” typically doesn’t work. Do we need to introduce other concepts around Python packaging to make it clear which platform we are targeting. Would allow modernising infrastructure. | Francois: major vendors are unlikely to backport new version of packages into old versions of their software, what would it mean to set a “supported until” guideline if it’s not a mandate? . | Cary: informal policy about backporting fixes is “upon request”, but won’t pro-actively back port new bug fixes to older releases. Major code complication issue when trying to backport fixes written with newer C++ version into older version which uses an older C++ compiler. | Francois: would be happy to incorporate guidelines coming from ASWF and other groups. Larry: VFX Platform may be in a better position to specify what to do, if major app vendors aren’t backporting new versions of ASWF projects into older products. Would be good to get “old version support policy” from vendors. | Nick: anything that can be shared from vendors? . | Robert Fanner: in similar situation to ASWF projects, want to be forward looking, don’t want to have to support ancient versions, but if an important / project needs a fix to an old version, may have to go back and patch it. May be specific to a customer / not wide release. What’s unlikely to happen would be to update the version of OpenEXR used by an old version, bigger changes are unlikely to be ported to old versions, smaller changes more likely. Large customers on air gapped network may care less about CVE / security fixes. Makes sense for VFX Reference Platform to put together tentative guidelines and run those by TAC. May take more conservative view of security fixes / CVEs. | Robert Vinluan: similar position, tend to support 4 years back, support last 2 major versions of Houdini releases, anything that would require to be patched to old versions would be on request only (showstopper for a studio), but only minor / small changes, would not be looking to bump an old version of Houdini to a new version of OpenEXR for instance. Larry: less concerned about back patching old versions rather than what needs to be supported for current versions. Studios will build an ecosystem around specific versions, so may need to support older formats even in current releases. | Robert Fanner: it is possible to work around lack of library namespace / versioning. | Nick: great feedback, will take this for discussion and come back. | Cary: need to do a better job to integrate the VFX Platform timeline into our projects. | Nick: most studios are open source licensees for Qt5, no more patches from The Qt Company, KDE has come with arrangement with Qt Company where they will produce patches critical patches (security + fixes) that isn’t a fork, which can be a path to keep using Qt 5.15 without having to live with serious security issues. | Patrick: supporting multiple C++ versions (for instance) adds significant costs to CI infrastructure, supporting all combinations of platforms / C++ compilers can be quite heavy / expensive. For OCIO thinking of moving to 2.1.x for next year, but nothing is decided yet, so will let VFX Platform now. | . | OAM Presentation (Rob) . | Rob Blau, product manager at Autodesk for Shotgun . | Open Asset Model (OAM) . | Asset Structure + Asset Behavior + Plugin Architecture . | Build asset management features . | Structured Data . | Assets (not files) . | Dependency tracking . | . | Automation . | Scene building . | Quality Control . | . | Collaboration . | Parallel contributions | . | . | Asset Structure . | USD-defined asset types: . | Layers, properties, variants . | Versioned . | Extensible, shareable . | . | . | Asset Behavior . | Implementation defining: . | Asset creation . | … . | . | . | Plugin Architecture . | Provide an abstraction over workflow details such as editor, storage, and asset structure . | Enable an ecosystem of workflow plugins that work across multiple studios . | . | Workflow ecosystem . | Known and standardized asset types . | Standards as running code, not just documents . | Known ways to interact with assets from DCCs . | . | Target is Open . | Able to commit to open sourcing the results . | Currently in a private GitHub repo separate from other code and targeting ASWF compatibility (and people being able to partner with it) (not enough in repo to show publicly yet) . | . | Partnering . | Building partnerships with studios, vendors, and industry groups . | Collecting example workflows and asset schemas . | . | There are WGs that are somewhat overlapping with some of these ideas, happy to follow up outside, or here . | Mathieu: working on a similar effort at Foundry, would love to collaborate, so should connect. More generally, how are Movielabs efforts impacting this (software defined workflows). Rob: yes, have been interacting with Movielabs, also security efforts, cloud efforts, one of the industry groups involved in OAM. | Mathieu: what’s the main problem the system is trying to solve? Rob: common representation, in particular being able to define those standard representations in an open ecosystem where no single vendor owns the representation, and doing it in a way that’s programmatically accessible so it doesn’t get reimplemented everywhere, but instead can use a standard / reference plugin. For instance how to reference a cut object (OTIO). Also help represent how a block of data represents an asset instead of just a bunch of files and directories. Mathieu: seems we have the same intentions, ideally can help build something common. | Kimball: have you been discussing with Asset WG? Rob: have been having internal conversations, WG seems to be more about “standard assets” rather than “asset standards”. Wave: yes, that’s correct. Could be interesting to see how to represent assets gathered by the WG could be represented in an OAM schema. A library of standard assets could be “converted” to an OAM schema. Michael Min: looks really interesting and exciting. Gordon: wanted to share with the group to get connections, these concepts exist in a lot of studios, so an opportunity to get more people engaged, see how it could fit their needs. Rob: yes, anyone who is interested in knowing more can reach out to Rob. Gordon: want to do this in the open, not having a data model to reason about assets limits what types of systems can be built. Makes it possible to connect DCCs, production management… Rob’s email contact: rob.blau@autodesk.com . | Anders: are you targeting specific asset kinds first? Rob: heart of post / vfx pipeline: assets with a rig, simple shot work, animation, lighting, comp. Then a bit deeper in editorial, flow of plates through editorial, time based disciplines. Going broad at first to get a good representation. Also collecting cases where it falls over, where production changes requirements at the last minute, multiple versions of an asset with same dependencies, designing around edge cases where if you don’t take those into consideration early, it gets ugly. Wave: what’s the relationship with OTIO? Rob: don’t want to be the assets themselves, want to wrap around the assets. So OTIO can be the standard asset for representing time based information. | . | OpenCue deep dive (time permitting, otherwise push to next meeting) . | PRs from John: . | #241 - Make TAC Repo into a site ( https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/241 ) . | #242 - Proposed working group changes ( https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/242 ) . | #243 - Proposed adjustments to the project lifecycle ( https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/243 ) . | Vote on Asset WG charter to make it an official WG: . | https://wiki.aswf.io/display/ARW/Asset+Repository+WG+Home | . | .

    "content": ". | Asset WG vote results . | Congratulations, the vote passed, now an official WG . | “League of Lawyers” meet on Friday . | Legal committee meetings: intention is to have reps from governing board + legal counsel . | Joshua: Netflix has Netflix Open Content - we asked for clarification on which licenses are used, Netflix volunteered to change to most permissive creative commons license (CC BY), very helpful and generous, thank you! Very helpful for OTIO . | . | Open Source Days - 2 questions (John) . | Summer conference, targeted towards practitioners in the industry . | Announced Aug 11-12, overlap with parts of SIGGRAPH, both are virtual. Is this a big issue / red flag? . | Wave: yes, this is an issue. SIGGRAPH will likely get higher priority. Carol: don’t want to have people have to choose, they will choose SIGGRAPH. First one we did was onsite at SIGGRAPH but that was in person. Last year we did it shortly after (before?) virtual SIGGRAPH. This year was penciled in Aug 11-12 but now overlaps. Rachel: Emily mentioned that last year it was before SIGGRAPH, felt that a presentation at SIGGRAPH could have brought more people to Open Source Days. So would be good to try to have it after SIGGRAPH so our SIGGRAPH presentations could bring people to our event. Larry: maybe issue with people being “zoomed out” after SIGGRAPH. | Daniel: virtual conferences tend to not engage people in the same way as in person ones, so people tend to juggle commitments with work commitments. So work + SIGGRAPH + ASWF commitments would be hard to juggle. | John: so feedback is that yes, this is a red flag to Governing Board next week, and hopefully we can get an updated plan. | John: 2nd Question. Typically the event has been an “invited speaker” event, this year we are toying with idea to have a “call for papers” to outside the main projects, would this be an opportunity to pull in talks we might not normally hear from. Wave: too much overlap with Pipeline Conference + DigiPro? Larry: we started this exercise as gathering the BoFs for these projects, often we would put out the word in community for anyone interested in speaking at the BoF. So many are already incorporating “invited speakers”. Kimball: we had Blender, other groups come in previously, that was quite successful even though not ASWF projects. Larry: we do have more projects now. John: some plans for some USD related presentations, but we don’t have space for 50 talks, likely more 6-8 talks. So should we put out a “call for papers” or do we already know who we want to talk to. Scott: for instance for the Rust WG, planning to present at DigiPro, could also present at Open Source Days? John: of course. Larry: can’t do the same talk as DigiPro, since that’s a refereed event. | Wave: since everything is recorded, can always point people to that. | Daniel: WGs are often discussion focussed, so that’s a good place for discussion focussed content. | Patrick: we still want the existing projects to have enough time to present all they have to present (OCIO ran short on time last year) . | . | Jonathan Stone: MaterialX proposal . | Project Contribution Proposal . | Requested project maturity level: incubation . | Don’t yet have a CII badge, but close to meeting those criteria, need to add static code analysis to the GitHub Actions test suite (across platforms and wide variations of platforms, but currently only runs build and test) . | Open Standard to represent materials in content pipelines. Closely aligned with OSL, OCIO and ACES. Planning to add OSL closures in MaterialX. | USDView / Hydra Storm supports MaterialX (collaboration between LucasFilm and Pixar) . | Modified Apache 2 license, same license for all new open source projects at Disney. | Hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/materialx/MaterialX . | No mandated external dependencies such as Boost, TBB. NanoGUI is optional dependency (for MaterialX viewer). | Full list of contributors in the contributors document in the repo, many companies have contributed so far (Sony for reference OSL definitions for OSL nodes, Autodesk for code generation and original definitions of physically based shading nodes, NVIDIA for MDL code generator, collaboration with Autodesk). | Discussion forum on Google Groups . | Issue tracking is handled through GitHub repo. | https://materialx.org . | Releases approximately every 3 months, 16 current releases . | MaterialX is an unregistered trademark of LucasFilm . | No code in MaterialX depends on commercial tools, so CI test suite only tests its own code, but for instance the Arnold code generator tests are run by Autodesk. Daniel: does test suite include many cross platform / GPU based tests? What are the requirements? Jonathan: MaterialX tests on Windows/Linux/macoS, multiple variants, including most recent and oldest supported compilers (nothing before C++ 11). Added GPU tests in last year, it’s somewhat challenging to do GPU tests in GitHub Actions, doing it with virtual frame buffers, currently doing GPU tests on Linux, hoping to extend to macOS and WIndows in the future, but only Linux tests are run automatically. Daniel: have always admired ambition of MaterialX, it is addressing important challenges. | Kimball: do we see any issues with adoption? Should we go ahead and vote? JF: moves to motion, Wave: seconds. | Are we at quorum? John: yes. All in favor, no opposes, no abstain. Welcome MaterialX to ASWF! . | . | OpenCue revue . | https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lh4vOz9WMWCq3y4JayD4H9Neqf-w_78laNobOdzB8uo/ . | Past Year . | Completed user survey . | Improved Windows support . | Improved GPU support . | Removed legacy code (Oracle DB support) . | GUI fixes and features (GUI for creating new shows) . | Code coverage 30% -&gt; 55% . | Metric dashboard with Prometheus / Grafana . | Lots of bugs fixes and improvements . | 185 PRs merged in last year | . | . | Year to come . | New user UX . | Python installation via pip . | Improved sandbox setup . | . | Docs refresh . | Component user guides . | API reference . | Configuration guide . | . | Tutorial docs to highlight new / existing features . | Eg Grafana dashboards . | Help attract new users, can’t just rely on ChangeLog . | . | . | Committers . | “Demonstrate having a healthy number of committers from a diverse contributor base” . | 7 committers from 5 different orgs . | 10 TSC members, many of whom are also committers . | Representation from studios, cloud providers, active users . | Active process to promote active contributors to committers, and committers to TSC . | . | . | Contributions . | Over the past year, 228 commits, rate of change is pretty good, changes keep coming but not too quickly | . | CII badge . | CII badge has 100% of passing criteria . | Test coverage &gt;50% but goal is to reach 80% this year . | . | Key Documents . | Committers, Charter | . | TAC . | Technical leads, license scan | . | ASWF Value . | “Be deemed by the TAC to add value to the mission of ASWF” . | Project is relatively new vs other ASWF projects . | End-user application . | Multi-component networked system . | Java/Python . | Collaborative environment for studios and cloud providers . | Have been able to use the same CI as other projects, so our systems can support a wide range of projects, such as end user applications. | . | Adoption (now) . | Project survey results . | Do you regularly use OpenCue . | 16 studios using OpenCue, a good result given the impact of adopting a new render queue system . | Wide range of sizes of deployments, from single digit to 5 digit number of render nodes . | . | Why aren’t you using OpenCue? . | Lack of features wasn’t a big issue (11%), helped to inform where to focus at TSC level . | 50% are already using something else (well established area in the industry) . | Focus on tutorials and docs . | . | . | Adoption (Future) . | Goals for 2021 . | New use UX improvements . | Better sandbox experience . | Fixes for common setup issues . | . | Docs refresh . | User guides . | Configuration Guides . | API reference . | Python examples . | . | . | Main work may be marketing, not technical . | . | Graduation proposal was also submitted to the TAC mailing list as a proposal . | Eric: “lack of Windows support”, “never heard of it” were listed as “why are you not using it”? Brian: surprising that folks responding to ASWF survey didn’t know about it. Windows question also highlighted new work, since Windows support was not available at first but got added, so need to do more to point out new features. | Kimball: are you having issues finding people to work on the Java component of OpenCue? Brian: doesn’t seem to have been an issue so far, active contributors have been comfortable so far. Hard to know if it’s scaring away potential contributors. Nothing “too fancy” being done in there, outside of the scheduler, which is a more complicated component. Kimball: have been finding issues finding Java developers, so was wondering if that was a more general issue. | Michael Min: hard problems such as schedulers, orchestration, permissions, is there some discussion around addressing those issues? Brian: yes, there are some of those features on the roadmap, didn’t include them in proposal since not sure about the timeline, have been having difficulty setting solid milestones, so most of the focus has been around improving existing functionality rather than brand new subsystems. Listed the broad goals, but there are lots of other features on the roadmap. | Larry: Imageworks has switched over to OpenCue entirely, were still using internal version until recently, was a large project to migrate over (new DB system), had to migrate fixes from internal version to OpenCue, but that process is now complete. | Eric: is it being used at Google? Brian: yes, some teams are using it internally. There were discussions around expanding cloud functionality, but that didn’t seem to be a priority from survey respondents. Cloud is being used for bursts, but not necessarily consistently. | Proposal is to graduate from Incubation to Adopted status. | Motion: Brian to move the motion, Larry will second. Approves, no opposes, SeanL: abstain, Michael Min: abstain, Eric: abstain. Motion is carried, congratulations, OpenCue has moved to Adopted status. | . | Patrick / OCIO . | Are in process of creating v2.0.1, should release beginning of May . | Officially sent that to VFX Reference Platform, v2.1 should be done by end of August, don’t have yet final feature set for v2.1 but working on it. | . | .

    "content": ". | MaterialX approved by Governing Board as well, yay, welcome! . | Approved officially by Governing Board last week | . | LFX Chat demo (John . | Jordan from LF IT to provide a demo of LF Chat, based on Matrix . | Steve Ira: LF has lots of projects, Open Source communities define the chat system they want to use, smaller communities have been asking for a solution . | Created infrastructure and defining policies, have a couple of PoC projects . | Not every open source project wants to use Matrix, some want to use a public/free Slack, some a paid for one, some IRC, some Discord . | Want to fit into vision of collaboration of a project, and help projects that are platform agnostic but just want something . | Matrix is connected to LF SSO, sign-in with LF SSO . | Matrix is similar to Slack and other modern Slack platforms . | Left tab has People and Rooms . | Most projects want to use something like Slack, but run into free instance retention limit (10K) and complexity to invite new user . | LF Matrix has limits on message retention, looking at archiving old messages after a couple of years into something like a S3 bucket so you can still get to old messages / search archives . | Screenshot . | Scott: how would you compare Matrix and Slack, does Matrix support threads? Jordan: Matrix has “replies”, but not a separate right panel view for a thread like Slack. This is a current design decision in Matrix. | Matrix has an API that you can hit with a token to post a payload into a channel, so could be used for GitHub events. Beta for LF Chat is working on bringing projects into the platform, and will be working into integrations. | Roadmap . | Onboard a couple of projects as a beta . | Automation around self service for the platform. Some things have been disabled such as channel creation for arbitrary users, since we want to know what LF project a new channel is associated to (for long term analytics). Also looking at self service panel for moderators. | Then common integrations: Zoom, GitHub, CIs (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) . | Brian: is there a mobile app / a way to get notifications? Jordan: what is being shown is “Element” front end, which has a web, desktop and mobile application, and you can set up notifications through all of these. | Matrix supports video and audio calls through Jitsi, currently working and expect to be “production ready” next week. Kimball: can you record the video? Jordan: doesn’t support recording natively, but something LF IT can look into. Not as full featured as Zoom, more similar to Google Meet / Slack Video calls. | . | Is ASWF interested in being part of a PoC? Kimball: biggest hurdle is running another app, but looks promising. Jordan: also supported by third party apps. Element is an Electron app. | JT: Gitter now using Matrix as a backend . | Questions of evaluating alternative to Slack? John: message retention of the free instance is the main issue. Pro tier is an “elastic” cost (per user / month), depends on the number of active users. A couple of years ago the TAC had looked at the cost and it was decided it wasn’t worth it. Could be around $20K annually. LF solution would be bundled in the existing IT (fixed) costs from LF charged to ASWF. Also this would tie in with existing SSO that’s being used across other LF services such as Wiki, mailing list. | Kimball: we want to be able to support new users without barriers (inclusion), are we trying to solve a problem we don’t have? Larry: we’ve never heard a clear statement on our budget limit. John: we can know how much it would cost today based on registered users. Larry: would be good to have an actual number. Kimball: that conversation hasn’t happened in any governing board meetings. | Larry: we could also split across multiple workspaces without loss of functionality. | John: are we agreeing that for near / mid term we want to stick with Slack? . | Scott: there could be a flood of new members from the Rust community. Kimball: we should pull some numbers to see how many active users we currently have for Slack and what it would cost. John: it would be around $1200/month, so not horrendous. | Larry: the retention problem is real, the cutoff is currently Feb 9 2021. Kimball: action item is to calculate budget needed to turn on message retention. John: can work on that. Daniel: the Slack business model doesn’t really fit our requirements, cost implications of growth. Would be useful if we could find a platform / approach that first our needs. Steve Ira: intention presentation wasn’t to “sell” the solution, looking for candidate projects. It could be disruptive to a project that’s already using Slack a lot. Problem for (smaller) projects that can’t afford the growth, There’s no rush, offering will “go live” towards the end of the year, so ASWF could always switch at a later date. | . | Review of project lifecycle/working groups proposal changes (John) . | Discussion with Kimball to review the project life cycle, PR in TAC repo . | 2 or 3 years into foundation existence, start to feel the need to review the process . | https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/243 . | How can we align with other foundations . | Should we add a “sandbox” stage for very early stage / experimental stage, so can have cooperation in the context of the ASWF, without all the costs / overhead of a “full blown” project. | Beefing up some of the requirements on the “Incubation Stage” projects, projects which would have already gone through the Sandbox stage would typically already have a a lot of those requirements in place. “Moving the bar up” . | Adopted Stage projects would require Gold-level CII badge . | Added more clarity on benefits, as well as review project (which we haven’t done in a very prescriptive way so far). | Projects should have a well defined way to engage with the TAC. | Also focussing on WGs working within the constraint of an established charter . | Also more definition around timeframe for WGs: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/242 . | Kimball: everyone should read the PR, will mail a link to the list. We can approve the PR as a group at next meeting. | . | Preview of TAC site (John) . | See screenshot . | Will get turned on, and will avoid issues with failing GitHub Actions on PRs . | . | Technical Project Updates . | OCIO . | about to release next patch release with some semi critical fixes, trying to ump VFX reference platform for CY2022 to 2.1.x, deadline to release is end of August after coordinating with VFX Reference Platform . | Accepted to do a long course at SIGGRAPH, deep dive in architecture and implementation of OCIO v2, deadline for recorded course is June 11. | . | Opencue . | Discussed feedback from TAC on graduation process | . | OpenEXR . | Things have been pretty quiet, steady trickly of issues, probably a patch release in a week or so. On the security front it looks like the bug reports that have been coming from Google OSS Fuzz are being turned into public VEs which doesn’t really mean much, by the time they are exposed, we have a fix for them, but it adds a bit of urgency on documentation. The good new is that the OSS Fuzz reports have died down to a trickle, just got one in the last few weeks, so that’s a good sign. | . | OSL . | Main activity has been chatting with MaterialX to standardize closures. First draft in good shape, will provide header definitions. Started discussions on a reference implementation for the BSDFs that will be part of the OSL test render project. A piece of the puzzle that’s been missing for a long time. | . | OTIO . | TSC charter got stuck for a while on trademark agreement, but should be moving forward now. Change asked by legal folks about wording around trademarks, may end up affecting other TSC charters related to Disney. | Last TSC meeting, Autodesk interested in integrating OTIO in RV. | Hoping to integrate with Review &amp; Approval WG activities. | . | Raw2Aces . | No update from Alex, looking at how to relicense, code is prepped from WETA to push into repo as soon as the license situation is resolved. | . | . | Working Group Updates . | Asset Repository . | Wave: Intel taking a crack at some reworking, good feedback from “league of lawyers” meeting. Context info on the licensing of Moana dataset. | What do we do if we get more contributions than we expect, both from storage and scope point of view. | Will look for guidance from the projects, “would you find this contribution useful” . | . | CI Working Group . | Daniel: Looking at the broader package management problem, moving from “ad hoc” methods to more sophisticated approaches, series of presentations from studios such as Sony and ILM on the topic . | Qt5: KDE patch collection : Qt Company will no longer provide long term support for Qt5, move “free” community to Qt6. KDE Group is starting a patch collection to provide community oriented long term support. | Wayland: coming up in a oblique way, requests to add Wayland to some of our CI Docker images. Wayland doesn’t yet “play well” with some of our platform / hardware choices. | JFrog Artifactory is happening, includes XRay for dependency scanning. | Gordon: would love to join the discussion on Qt and Wayland. Daniel: maybe we dedicate some discussion time at the next TAC? Kimball: have been doing some experimentation with Wayland, so very interested. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Bill: nothing major | . | Python 3: . | Ashley: nothing to report, WG has been going on for a year, initial deliverables were taken of, somewhat running out of discussion topics, waiting for feedback from studios. Vendors are mostly done with transition. May keep meeting every couple of weeks, may switch to an on-demand schedule. Kimball: good time to read the lifecyle of WG PR, this could be an opportunity to close down a WG that has completed its mandate. | . | Rust . | Scott: Digipro/SIGGRAPH, planning to have separate talks. Waht to deliver OpenEXR in Rust. Have a website in progress, working towards MVP for OpenEXR bindings, currently reading / writing. All the crates are now owned by LF, friday meeting to touch base. | . | USD . | WebViz: USD toolkit in WebAssembly . | Investigation into USD Standard Camera . | Meeting today, getting clear understanding of how physical and practical cameras can be represented in CG workflow. Looking at real world standards for lenses and cameras, and Nick Porcino’s rig. | Looking at NVIDIA to do presentation at USD extension. WOrk at Pasadena open source group, how to embed “headless” DCCs into Jupyter notebooks . | . | Review/Approval WG . | Track 1: Standardized exchange of review data . | Stage: Discovery . | Status: Sam Richards leading initial discovery of commonalities . | Expected outcome: WIP proposal doc . | . | Track 2: Shared open source Playback module Project . | Stage: Discovery . | Status: Dneg preparing presentation on their OS offering for the next meeting(5/11), to compare to the SPI offering and determine community support. | Expected outcome: a TBC proposal to the TAC on a new OS project housed and managed by ASWF to support community efforts for a shared collection of modules for creating a media playback system. | . | . | . | .

    "content": ". | Project lifecycle feedback (John) . | Preview last week . | Larry put some comments on the PR, wanted to open back up for conversation . | Broken up into separate smaller PRs . | Proposed working group changes . | Project lifecycle update - proposal process, TAC review, annual review changes . | Project lifecycle update - Add sandbox, adjust incubation . | Project lifecycle update - Add sandbox, adjust incubation . | Project lifecycle update - Archive stage . | . | Kimball: was having issues reading through the changelog format . | Bill Ballew: increases the level of the CII badge, seems like it’s already been a challenge for some of the projects. | John: in other communities, they have increased the badge level, but not always easy to interpret the requirements. | Larry: what are the additional requirements for the higher level of badge, and if they mostly don’t apply to our projects, we should differentiate that from higher levels that would be beneficial to our projects. | Silver level CII criteria . | Criteria for web site contributions . | Legal infrastructure (we already use CLA) . | Governance documented . | Code of conduct (default one from ASWF) . | Project oversight (OCIO has that in place) . | Project roadmap . | Documentation . | Quickstart Guides . | Security . | Keeping up to date . | Repository . | . | Accessibility and I18N . | These are “shoulds”, not sure if they are relevant | . | . | So a lot of these requirements are typically already met with our projects . | Larry: a lot of these requirements seem valid / applicable . | Kimball: what’s the difference between Silver and Gold? John: many of the “shoulds” become “musts”. Copyright hygiene, version control hygiene. But also security reviews that may or may not be valuable, could be funded by the ASWF if we decide it is worth it. | A lot is about how the software is delivered, one of the big pieces of last week’s Executive Order on cybersecurity is a software “bill of materials”. | Kimball: are we at the point where we are ready to work with this. Bill: would this be retroactive applied? John: typically existing projects would be grand fathered into their current status, but would need to meet additional requirements to transition to a “higher” level. For instance OTIO in incubation stage would need to meet updated “graduated” level requirements to transition to that stage. | Chris: can a project go for higher CII level than required by its ASWF status? Yes, of course. | Michael Min: who is “checking the checkmarks” for these badges? What’s the periodic maintenance? John: it’s a voluntary / self certification project, up to the projects to self report. Are there paths to escalate a challenge to a project’s self reporting? Not sure. Larry: these aren’t just checkboxes, when you check “yes” on “do you have a INSTALL.md”, you also have to explain your work, including providing a URL. So still on the honor system, but most answers require explaining / giving URL. | Cary: ideally would like to hear some guidance from above about the amount of effort that this requires and whether it’s worth it. OpenEXR asked itself “how seriously do we need to take this” (especially for security requirements). Would like guidance from the Board, which might in turn ask the TAC. How do we best allocate scarce resources, and is conforming to these higher level requirements “worth it”. Henry: yes, it has to be for a purpose, since it adds a burden. So we should have a clear rationale for doing this. Kimball: security requirements ended up driving adoption of Google OSS-Fuzz, which did increase the quality of the software. Cary: that decision was made by OpenEXR. Kimball: would this have been done if OpenEXR didn’t have to meet those requirements? Hard to tell. John: other communities will sometimes wrap themselves around these questions, these requirements came from a mixed bag of best practices / ways to ensure sustainability in projects. CII came from Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL, it was found that it was such a crucial piece of project, 60-70% of Internet connected systems, but maintained by only 12 people (4 of the named Larry!). So if those people walked away / couldn’t get investment. Aligning these practices helps to show how excellent projects work and how external parties can gain trust in it. Could look at a third party / external resource for some parts such as security audit, recommendation. Could be raised to the board for funding. | Kimball: maybe best to not have all the changes in a single commit. For instance the idea of a Sandbox stage could be its own commit. John: that’s a good idea. Larry: if we’re going to split those up, maybe there’s a project that’s interested and voluntarily try to achieve the higher level and report back how much effort it was / whether it was worth it. Kimball: yes, that’s a good idea. | John: we’re currently at “passing” level as a requirement, so this would be increasing to Silver or Gold. Larry: OSL is still in incubation. John: one of the graduated / active stage projects would be a good candidate, they would be a good judge of how hard it would be to move to Silver / Gold. Kimball / Cary: will discuss this at the next OpenEXR TSC meeting tomorrow. John: David Wheeler is behind that CII badge system and could present to the TAC if required. John to work on splitting up the PR into separate components. | Also have a similar proposal for Working Groups, that one is much simpler, it’s a much smaller document. Main change is having a structured review process for WGs, and having a charter in place before a WG starts up. | Rachel: only challenge from WG is that first part of D&amp;I WG was putting together the charter. John: initial activity of a WG is indeed to create the charter. Would be good to have that spelt out. D&amp;I is an interesting example, feedback from board members is what does the longevity of a WG looks like, D&amp;I could last longer, but being able to revise charter on annual basis is a good idea. Rachel: approaching 1 year mark, want to summarize what was done over the year and see if anything needs to be adjusted. So one year evaluation seems like a good time to look at whether current goals still make sense. | Bill Ballew: are we putting a limit to 2 years, and everything above that would be something else than a WG? John: purposefully vague language, gives flexibility to the TAC as to what it wants to do, maybe we should say explicitly that the TAC could extend indefinitely. Larry: why a bias against long running WGs? Some activities won’t produce code (and are thus not “projects”). Wave: that could be a “committee” which is an ongoing thing, as opposed to a WG which is meant to address a specific issue / topic. Cory: USD WG is an example of an open ended commitment to help with USD adoption. | John: recognition that ongoing WG would be exception rather than the rule, make sure there’s enough of a rigorous structure around WGs to make sure they mostly have a end point. So the TAC has the ability to support a bounded number of WGs. So the TAC can keep a WG longer if wants to, but that should be the exception rather than the rule. | Cary: D&amp;I doesn’t seem to quality as a “WG” in that context, more a “committee”. But the Asset WG would seem to fit that. Daniel: does it become a project? Wave: don’t know the answer, but people who have signed up to figure out what the asset repository will look like typically have not signed up to be the ones maintaining it. | Daniel: so perhaps we need to have a different structure for long running activities. | Kimball: it’s also about managing the focus, “we can only attend so many meetings”. Larry: 3 canonical examples are “Python 3” which will come to an end, the D&amp;I which we want to do “indefinitely”, and something in the middle like the Rust WG which will likely transition into a project with specific software. | Henry: At DNEG we differentiate between Steering Committees (ongoing) vs Working Groups (to resolve a question or make a recommendation to a SG). Tends to be more formalization around Steering Groups, a WG meant more to answer a question or make a recommendation back to a SG. | . | Open Source Days? . | Rachel: at last board meeting it was recommended to chat with DigiPro / The Pipeline Conference, that didn’t work out, but have an opportunity to do a talk at one of those. | Going with Aug 4-5 for Open Source Days, week between Digipro and SIGGRAPH. | 3-4h core day, with options for overflow, want to prioritize sessions with the projects. Looking for projects who want to participate. | Talked with David Morin about 30m-1h, trying to keep it to a condensed day, so limited opportunity for extended talks. | Kimball: if we try to trim things down too much, do we want Open Source days to be a replacement for BoFs at SIGGRAPH, or will projects need to also do a SIGGRAPH BoF if they don’t have the time to do community engagement. We need to decide this. | Larry: Bofs used to be the one time when you could collaborate, but now we have TSCs / ASWF, so BoFs may be less important. | Kimball: BoFs also give an opportunity for people who are lurkers to wander into a room, have a chat and wander out. Sean L: yes, has some outreach value. | Carol: is the purpose of outreach of internal connection with people already familiar with the project. | Rachel: is the question around 1h not enough time to do an open source day presentation? Kimball: what is the purpose of the Open Source Days, telling each other “what we already know”, or outreach? 30 min presentation is not necessarily enough, 1h BoFs seemed to be enough. | Larry: BoFs not necessarily about presentations. Kimball: rarely had AV equipment at BoFs. | Rachel: getting a sense from David Morin to have a place to showcase the ASWF and the projects, interesting things happening. Not clear if it’s “outreach vs internal communication”. We do want to attract people and have them learn about what we are working on. Position us as an attractive place to land relevant projects. | John: ASWF has 2 events a year, Open Source Forum in the winter, focussed on speaking to an exec audience, and Open Source Days looking to speak to technical audience. Kimball: so more an outreach event. John: when we are back in person, have more opportunity to do both, but more challenging in an online setting. | Kimball: We have dates, and will work on the schedule. Rachel: how did that work historically / what works best for us? . | Kimball: in the past we didn’t plan that much, each project got a timeslot. | “Friends of the ASWF” projects are also in scope for this year. | . | Summer Learning program: Mentor edition (Carol, Rachel) . | Carol: summer learning program (mentorship) is coming up. | Documents: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16WJoJfw2mBeR2LT_IGlsYGwcdkvdz0R7 . | Posted on #general and #diversity Slack channels today . | Looking for mentors and reviewers: sign up sheet https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16WJoJfw2mBeR2LT_IGlsYGwcdkvdz0R7 . | When people think of mentors, people think of an intern to which you are trying to teach a specific skillset, like a “Google Summer of Code” Intern. This is more what “mentor” used to be: networking, career development, someone that you can ask general questions to. 3 months beginning of July. Requesting a minimum bi-weekly meeting with student, can be flexible if want to do more. Would love to fill as many slots for mentors and reviewers from the ASWF community before reaching out to external parties. Looking at 12 applicants, based on conservative numbers based on budgets and resources. Already have 60 applicants. ASWF would like to cross advertise and that hasn’t happened yet. Don’t want to bite off more than we can chew, but accept as many learners as we can. Can theoretically scale this at fairly minimum cost. | Also looking for reviewers for applications, many of us have done peer review of papers already, so similar process. General questions such as rating student’s interest in getting into the industry, not requiring any baseline experience to get into the program. | Larry: great to have all those applications, have you looked at enough of them to have an idea of how many of those are software related which we have expertise in vs “scattered through the production pipeline”. Carol: likely to be all over the place, and likely less on the technical side, since it was meant to get people excited about the industry in general. Feel that anyone in this room would be a great mentor. | Rachel: will also provide a Slack channel to help build a community. Also providing online learning platform, likely Gnomon, so they can take the classes they are interested taking (centered around VFX / Animation, not necessarily just writing software). Have looked at a number of applications, and they are indeed “ all over the map”. If there is a good match between a specific applicant and a specific mentor, we will try to do those matchups. There will be at least 12 people, but looking to grow to 24 or at max 32. | Carol: if you have questions about mentoring, or if you think you know someone who would be a good fit (should have call for volunteers at TSC meetings). Wave: is there a clear /approved “blurb” that can be shared? Rachel: the blurb is mostly the first paragraph, also the ASWF blog entry: ASWF Diversity and Inclusion Summer Learning Program - ASWF . | Other opportunities for mixing can happen on Slack as well, as well as 3 members of the D&amp;I WG will be “team leads” to help in that Community space. | . | Project Updates . | What are the pending release plans? . | Should we schedule another VES tech / VFX platform group discussion for platform 2022? . | From Scott / Rust WG: We’re focusing on creating the Rust bindings for OpenEXR, and are making pretty good progress. If anyone wants to help out creating bindings, then we’ll gladly use the support. (Head to the #rust channel and we’ll help set up the dev environment.) . | . | . ",

    "title": "Agenda",
    "content": ". | Project lifecycle updates (revamp / breakdown of John’s original pull request) . | PR 267: codifies what we’ve done previously, adds a bit more structure, matches our practices up to date. Slight wrinkle to have projects submit their proposal and give the TAC a bit of time to review (2 weeks?). TAC members to have time to review and speak at next meeting. In the past annual review has been focussed on projects in Incubation Stage. This codifies that all projects should get annual review, adds some structure. Other communities have adopted that. Not so much you are “going in front of the court”, more an opportunity to have a touchpoint with the TAC. Kimball: don’t have a concern with that wording. Should structure these throughout the year so we don’t have all the reviews at the same time. Kimball: wanted to do a deep dive on WGs and projects on a regular basis (OpenVDB hasn’t attended in a while). John: we can keep track of that, have something on the TAC site to track the dates. Cary: this is somewhat similar to the Silver/Gold badge requirement. It is valuable as a whole to hear what is the state of each project. John: this can also be used as an exercise to create “project health reports” that can also be external facing. Project health is important, also want to make sure that projects don’t feel like they aren’t getting proper attention. | PR 270: archive stage Some concern from Larry: don’t want to force a project into archive stage by the TAC, should be a decision of the project. Commit activity may not be a correct sign of project activity. Criteria ought to be “is this a project the industry doesn’t need anymore”. Can imagine a project that doesn’t need activity (feature complete / no bugs are found), just because commits aren’t happening is not a sufficient indicator. Also showing “churn” just to demonstrate activity should be a non-goal. Larry: archiving should mean “this is a project that isn’t important / relevant to the community anymore”. For instance a replacement technology may come out that makes a project no longer important. Also if a project isn’t getting the developer attention it needs, that’s where the TAC needs to marshall resources. John: once something goes into Archive mode, it’s not necessarily dead, it could always be brought back. | PR 268: Sandbox Stage Projects forming within the foundation instead of outside. Requirements are fairly low, basically just the proposal and how it can add value. Benefits is mostly infrastructure, but TAC wouldn’t be spending a ton of time. Also a place to put a lot of the processes in place that would normally be part of the onboarding process. Could projects just want to stay in Sandbox project? John: probably an “anti pattern”, typically a project would want to stay in Sandbox for a limited amount of time. Is there a place in our foundation for a “one person project”. Some communities find that this isn’t quite as valuable, want wider “buy-in”, other communities take the “if not here, where else?” approach. JT: Pasadena group is using Sandbox model, seems to be working well, especially for tech startups. Demonstration of how it works might be useful. Could have someone come and present on this sandbox topic. Larry: hard to judge without some concrete examples, would be a bit worried if projects not up to our quality standards could join to just get the “halo effect” without going through all the steps to make it through incubating / graduation project. JT: want these groups to join. John: CNCF gets 18 incubator projects in a TAC meeting, so have a lot of similar concerns. Projects want to ride the brand affinity. They want the sandbox stage to timeout after a while, if it isn’t moving after a while, encourage moving somewhere else. Kimball: could take longer than a year for incubation. Eric: sounds very “case by case”, maybe put it in the rules and see how it goes for a couple of years? . | PR 269: Adopted Stage Main stage is change to Gold level badge, and clarifying benefits. | PR 242: Working Groups Kimball: for instance has Python 3 WG has achieved its goals, should we extend it, change its charter? . | . | Report on the CII badge lift (gold stars for everyone!) . | Cary: looked at badge requirements for silver level. Marked a number of them. They fall into 4 categories: . | Easy ones, filled them out . | Issues that need some discussion, either don’t apply, or need clarification as to what they mean . | A few issues seem worth doing: a published roadmap, quickstart guide (OpenEXR kind of already has that), making sure the documentation is as accessible to newcomers as it should be, requires cleanups . | Some issues that are workflow issues that we wouldn’t do otherwise, but we could probably accommodate them if we decided to go for the badging . | . | Overall, Silver and Gold levels are not out fo reach . | For example, project has a requirement of an “uninstall”, which is not provided by CMake, not clear what to do about that. | Cryptographically signing releases: previous maintainers signed the tarballs, but let that drop by the wayside, wasn’t clear it added value. But we could bring that back. Have figured out how to generate the signatures based on the GPG keys, other half of the equation is how do people who want to verify the signatures get their key? Unclear on that process. | Kimball: usually you publish your public key to a public repo. Andrew: distributions all have an automation key they use, so artifact producing CI systems have a key they use. For more Linux distributions, they have a specific key for every major release (for instance Fedora 34, Fedora 34…). LF is running internally on Jenkins a system called Sygill which was developed for Fedora, can maintain signing keys in a way that is safe for CI systems, the key is never on the actual CI build agent. The build agent uses a different key to request signing from a signing server. Looking at how this could be provided for platform CI systems (GitHub Actions for instance). Already doing this for OpenDaylight, which have specific signed release artifacts. There is also the concept of “attestation” for developers that generates keys on the fly stored in a public ledger, but doesn’t work as well for release artifacts. Cary: looks like something LF RelEng is something it could help use with. | Eric: what’s the cost/benefit of going to a higher badge level? There’s already a load for onboarding new projects. Andrew: don’t need to meet all those levels to join at incubation level. Eric: but if a project joins ASWF, it is typically to become a “full” project. Cary: our existing projects follow best practices, and can serve as examples. Larry: depends on what’s on the list that our projects follow, versus “jumping through hoops”. Cary: as far as OpenEXR is concerned, not very far away from meeting requirements. Daniel: CI WG / LF RelEng can work on release signing, and could get “for free” by adopting ASWF CI pipeline. Kimball: this was one of the items that was on the proposed list of changes to the project lifecycle. Andrew: after Solarwinds incident, as well as other pushes from federal govt around security of software supply chain, LF will push more on projects to meet these requirements. Kimball: simple things like the roadmap is a no brainer that doesn’t have implications on security. Roadmaps would help communication with VFX Reference Platform for instance. | . | Reviews for summer learning program? . | Carol: had a few more folks sign up, please recommend anyone else who might be available, need reviewers more urgently than mentors. The more reviewers, the less work each person has to do! | . | Project / WG updates . | Assets WG / Wave . | needs TSC &amp; community members to add to this wish list: https://wiki.aswf.io/display/ARW/Wish+List . | What assets would projects like to see / need for their uses . | . | OSL / Chris . | Nothing major to report, getting a bit closer to approving the logo, selected the shape, tweaking the colors. | Kimball: are you doing a release for SIGGRAPH? Larry: just sent an email about doing a major release, even though OSL is not part of VFX Platform, use and are a dependency of VFX Platform components, so aiming to be in beta by SIGGRAPH. | . | OpenEXR / Cary . | In the midst of a minor release that comes out tomorrow, fixes a small glitch in the last release. Moving towards a 3.1 release before Open Source Days, includes work from Kimball on acceleration, half type, C API, threading improvements in OpenEXR core. | . | OpenCue / Brian . | Working on Python packaging process. Working on the GUI component of the system. | . | OCIO / Michael . | Preparing on SIGGRAPH long course, recording is due end of next week. | Nice technical improvements in progress, hopefully part of OCIO 2.1 in time for SIGGRAPH . | New OFX nodes so you can use OCIO in Resolve and other OFX aps . | ACES 1.3 gamut compressed PR . | iMath 3 support for half type dependency . | . | . | OpenVDB . | OpenTimelineIO . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: haven’t heard back from SIGGRAPH D&amp;I summit . | Monthly meeting next Wednesday, open invitation to TAC members . | Summer program . | Want to discuss the Adobe Open Framework proposal with Bill Roberts . | . | Python 3 / Ashley . | No new updates. Kimball: WETA finally have a Python 3 working environment, should have live productions running by end of year | . | USD . | CI / Daniel . | Main topic has been VFX Platform and set of associated issues, sunsetting older versions . | Related to supply chain issues: LF has been working with JFrog to get an open source account to give us access to Artifactory Pro and XRay, a product analysis tool, analyses dependencies. | Larry: if the projects are trying to sync releases with SIGGRAPH, they are all grappling with how far back they need to support the VFX Platform. We need more guidance. | Daniel: this is an abstract issue we can fix in practice. We can enact a specific duration, and see if that’s accepted. | Larry: a lot of projects have dropped anything earlier than C++ 14, which de factor drops support for VFX Platform before 2018. Daniel: will bring that back for next TAC meeting. | Kimball: will arrange to have Nick/Francois from VFX Platform to show up for an upcoming meeting. Daniel: also took an action item for discussion on Wayland. | . | . | . ",

Notified VFX Platform of this version. | John: ASWF wants to showcase new releases, please share with Rachel, blog post for the new release can be useful. | Cary / OpenEXR: planning 3.1 releases, coming out as a beta in 2 weeks, official release before SIGGRAPH . | Ken / OpenVDB: released 8.1 a few days ago, targeting 9.0 for SIGGRAPH, not 100% sure yet. 8.1 does not have nanoVDB yet, it’s branched off an old version, so be brought up to 8.1, but still not in main branch, that’s targeted for 9.0. nanoVDB main development being done in a private, on invitation branch, please send GitHub id if interested. Runtime compression can shrink volume size up to 8x without visual artifacts. | Larry: lots of people are building nanoVDB, but this can make it complicated to line up with VFX Platform, so guidance would be useful. Ken: nanoVDB is part of OpenVDB, but it is also somewhat independent. So when bumping up nanoVDB version, not reflected in OpenVDB. But you can use the one currently in the feature branch. John: nanoVDB is in a private repo? Ken: it is in both. There’s a public version in a feature branch, needs a full review going into main branch. But the active day to day development is happening in a private repo for historical reasons. Larry: should we think of these at separate projects? Ken: no, it will be a single project, and it really would be best to wait for OpenVDB 9.0. John: was asking about private repo since the charters specify that development should be done in public repos? Ken: issue is that some internal NVIDIA developers are committing directly to private repos, this will all be over in a couple of months. | Scott: Rust WG is going to announce its existence to a wider audience. | John: please share any major releases with the group and with Rachel for announcements . | . | Lifecycle and working group changes . | Working Group Proposed Changes . | JF: this seems pretty uncontroversial / no outstanding issues, should we just merge / vote? . | https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/242/files#diff-a5ff62b265350989694cd270c55b7b5ef445d0296982b6437334f35aa67ac943 . | A section was added around long term working groups (such as D&amp;I): TAC can establish a WG as a long term WG after a year (requires super majority). WG still has its charter renewed annually, but no expectation that the group needs to be disbanded after a year . | Sean Looper: should we say “every WG should check in every 6 months”? John: seems reasonable . | Michael Min: we had also discussed the issue of Committees (long term) vs WG. John: that is an approach we can take. Took the “long term WG” wording to keep things simpler. | Sean : what would be the functional distinction between a WG and a Committee? Michael: could be a specific TAC person who sponsors a “Committee” or long term WG. | Carol: from perspective of D&amp;I group: words have a lot of meaning, “committee” seems overly formal, “Working Group” seems more descriptive of the work being done. Gordon: if the only distinction is the duration, having a single nomenclature has advantages, especially since you don’t know in advance how long something can last. Also, we don’t want to go a year without hearing back. Committees should report “at least” every 6 months, but can be more often. Sean: can provide this guidance in the charter. Can depend on the nature of the WG, and should be described in the charter of the WG. John: can adjust the wording. Any other concerns? Will then reach out and we can vote to get it in. Gordon: should there be a clause that allows the TAC to vote to amend the charter of a WG? John: typically projects and WGs work quite autonomously, so although the TAC can make requests on a WG, shouldn’t requests to amend the charter come from the WG itself? Gordon: maybe have language that says that TAC can vote on charter amendments, without specifying where the amendments come from. Carol: D&amp;I WG is looking at revisiting its charter after a year, looking at formalizing some specific items around leadership structure. John: it’s useful for WGs to have some introspection about their aims and goals. Have rarely seen friction between TAC and WGs in other projects, in practice it tends to be amicable. Gordon: definitely not proposing any adversarial processes! John: it makes sense to allow a WG to change its charter and propose back to the WG. Will be sent as an email instead of a PR (with the full text). | . | Archive Stage . | Adding more structure / clarity around that stage. | Was there something left to adjust? Larry? Make sure that “no longer relevant to the industry” is the criterion for moving a project to Archive Stage. | JF: gives TAC an additional tool for deciding that a project is no longer relevant. Bill: and we have the option to move back to adopted stage. | JF: propose to accept, Bill: second. All ayes, no opposes / abstains, will be merged in. | . | Proposal Process . | Puts structure around proposal process, and the presentation to the TAC. It has been quite informal so far, now formalizes what a project should prepare for. | Changed some “the TAC may” to “the TAC will”. | Also discusses annual reviews, and process for the TAC to move the project to the next stage. | Bill: we have a backlog of projects to review. Could send the review / proposal ahead over email for review to minimize the time spent in the TAC meetings. | Bill: good to adopt this? John: should we vote to adopt the PR? Sean Looper: move to adopt, Michael: second. All ayes, no oppose or abstain. | . | Let’s skip the other 2 for now . | . | Project Updates . | OCIO: Michael. Planning for 2.1 release for SIGGRAPH. Just finished SIGGRAPH course which took a lot of time, should be beneficial to the community. JF: can the course material be released? Ken: you sign over the copyright to SIGGRAPH, at least until the end of SIGGRAPH. Carol: should be able to share it after the fact. John: would be interesting to turn into a longer term course, could talk to the training people at Linux Foundation. Michael: it’s a 3hr course, have a 2.5hr video, 200 slide deck. Ken: same for OpenVDB. John: we can discuss after SIGGRAPH. Ken: have given course every 2nd year after SIGGRAPH, have put up the slides on the web site. Would be a good idea to have an introductory course for OpenVDB. JF: training section of aswf.io site? John: you can generate certificates for courses, or at least badges. Patrick: OCIO is planning for a 2.0.2 release (current is 2.0.1) . | OpenEXR: Cary. Working towards significant release prior to SIGGRAPH, mostly work done by Kimball, optimizations in Half type, new threaded implementation of core I/O routines. This weekend is target feature freeze, have all the functionality in place. At the point of starting to formulate message of how to present the new functionality, so that’s what we will be spending the next few weeks on. Also putting out a patch release to 2.5 with security fixes requested by one of the distro package managers. Starting to talk about what we will want to discuss during Open Source Days, trying to accumulate questions we will want to have answers to. Started process of setting up OpenEXR Confluence Wiki page to hold meeting notes, building off what was done for OCIO. Not generally a huge fan of Confluence, but it seems like a nice way to maintain this kind of information without the overhead of storing in the repo, starting to embrace this more. | OpenVDB: Ken. Released 8.1.0 couple of days ago. Minor release, but major in terms of features and bug fixes, over 100 entries in changelog. Highlights are deprecating support for version 5 (policy is to support only the 2 last major versions listed on VFX Platform). Thinking of getting rid of Python Boost bindings, were added early in the project, but are causing build headaches. Looking to use PyBind11, but no one in TSC wants to do it. Trying to “outsource” the work. If anyone has issues with this, please speak up / reach out. Intending to have an API compatible replacement. Have a SIGGRAPH talk and a long course. | OSL: Larry. Further integration of SIMD batch shading work from Intel, and work on Optix/CUDA backend. Not quite ready for a release, but not part of VFX Platform, so less schedule pressure. | OTIO: Nick: focussing on solid Python builds, and delivering Python wheels to PyPI. Going slowly, knocking down problems one by one. | Asset WG / Eric: framework is up on the Wiki for wishlist requests, encourage each project to think about what production assets would make your project better and post it up there. | D&amp;I: Carol: reviewing deadline is Friday, mentorships start on July 1st, look out for emails. Should have a further update about accepted 20 students at next meeting. | Rust/Scott: working on onboarding process, and working on bindings for OpenEXR. | USD: Michael, had subcommittee meeting with USD Camera, discussing rationale of how metadata is dropped into VFX workflows. | . | .

    "content": ". | Nick and Francois will be joining again. I would like us to do this a couple times per year so we can enhance the VFX reference platform collaboration. | Welcome François and Nick . | Kimball: WETA struggles with how many VFX Platform years to support, currently supporting 5 in production, definitely a burden. Ken: definitely causing frustration. In OpenVDB decided to support current + 2 previous years of VFX Platform, posted on forum, didn’t get any objections. Some studios seem to be very slow to update. Francois: can you clarify “supporting an older version”? There’s a range of what “supporting” means: CVEs, critical bug fixes, back porting small features. ASWF could define what the policy is. Most larger studios support “every version that runs on the current OS”, also driven by versions of commercial tools. Larry: one more dimension exists, how far back in versions does OpenEXR need to patch, but also if OpenEXR is just building its current version, how far back in terms of the dependencies it has should it be able to build against. Ken: had a recent complaint that current version of OpenVDB 8.1 does not build with latest version of OpenEXR 3.0. That was decided because OpenEXR 3.0 is not part of VFX Reference Platform, but there was lack of understanding of why projects in the ASWF aren’t in lockstep. When 8.1 is released, deprecate everything in the code relative to version 5. Any changes to ABI, change the major version, but will keep the code (using #pragmas) so you can build version 8 with ABI 6. The cutoff means getting rid of that old compatibility code. | Francois: that’s definitely outside the scope of the VFX Platform, it’s about binary compatibility, which requires API and ABI compatibility for compiling and linking. | Nick: have been having conversations about sunset guidance, can get complex very quickly. More inclined to figure out what’s the simplest guidance we can give, and what’s the goal of this guidance. It’s about setting expectations with studios and consumers of software, and setting expectations of software developers of how long are expected to support versions. On vfxplatform.com site, specifying current year + 3 previous years is on the main page, and everything else could be moved to archive page. There are of course exception, but 3-4 years seems to be perceived as reasonable by large studios, even if they have projects that run longer than that. Once we get to BoF at SIGGRAPH, would like to be able to publish high level sunset guidance. | Kimball: it’s not so much the specific version number, but more the C++ support level (C++ 11/14/17), these major switches are where a project like OpenEXR typically has issues. Compiled plugins for old versions of Maya for instance. There was some discussion of switching of major compiler versions could also be coordinate with switching major compiler versions? C++ major release cadence has been on 3 year schedule. Nick: only last year CY2020 C++ 14 was still the version, so new sunset guidance would still expect those versions to be supported. Gordon: Maya USD plugin gets tricky, developers want to adopt new version of a C++ standard, will try to support any back versions as possible, but can have really bad impact on code quality. | Francois: hard to imagine practical guidance for ASWF projects to force latest code to compile against specific old versions of software, not asking for “Maya USD plugin to be compiled for Maya 2016”. Nick: clear high level guidance can be critical to help manage expectations, “this is the industry expectation / practice”. Kimball: if we say “patches for 3-4 years”, does that sound like a good proposal? Anyone have counter examples? Francois: off the shelf apps that ship with bundled libraries (statically linked / compiled in a special way), so even if ASWF projects get patched, commercial software may not be. Gordon: how do we provide security responsiveness for older versions vs how many versions of VFX Platform can be supported in a single software version? Internally have tools to track security issues, but can get tricky (for instance Qt 5 is already out of support window). How do we get a CVE plan in place for software that links statically. Had a chat with Cory to get more visibility on CVEs for USD, EXR does a really good job so could set the standard? We definitely have exposures as a community. For commercially released software, mostly target the current year, it’s just too hard otherwise. Kimball: would it make sense to publish package building scripts. For instance a script to build OpenEXR 2.1 (especially since most packages are using CMake). Gordon: trying to move distribution of some open source components to separate distributions (for instance Maya USD). | Kimball: CI WG has a couple of build solutions, and there’s Sony spk, this may be part of the solution. Michael Min: is there a “reference platform” for color / accuracy, different compilers can result in different mathematical results in renderer / color management libraries. Is there a consideration to the image fidelity of changes to VFX Platform projects? Nick: definitely not the primary focus, but we still see some of these issues today around details of floating point math. Kimball: when starting to substitute Clang for gcc, ran a suite of visual comparisons to make sure there weren’t issues. Michael: that’s an example from a large studio, so could be useful to present some general guidance. Kimball: a reason to have a compiler on the spec. Ken: responsibility of individual projects to have these regression testing. Changes are sometimes desired, sometimes not. Have to be an expert on the project to know if this is intentional or not. Gordon: OCIO has invested in testing, especially since changing the engine. Larry: all projects should be individually addressing and should not only include “CentOS 7 + gcc specified by VFX Platform” in their CI build suite. Just testing against VFX Platform releases is not sufficient. Kimball: OpenEXR has to be good about CVEs since it is now included in some OSes, which demand it. Gordon: USD team is doing a great job in their responsiveness, but it’s still unclear which version a CVE is fixed in. | Francois: policy around cutoff dates: publication date is the cutoff date, can add a note about future expectations, but when publishing at SIGGRAPH, expect the software to be released. There is always some room for community process to update a release for the next year, but the official date is SIGGRAPH. Nick: Sept 1st is hard cutoff. Ken: SideFX has been pushing for new major version of OpenVDB every year. Have been pushing the deadline. Francois: SideFX is probably vendor most dependent on OpenVDB, they are represented on VFX Platform group. | Kimball: 3-4 year window for maintaining patches seems to be in general agreement, we probably need to discuss this more formally. | We should do this more regularly. Nick: happy to be there, can bring other members of the VFX Platform WG. | . | Project / WG Updates (hopefully with discussion about what should be in VFX platform 22, any issues, etc) . | Python 3 WG: Ashley: no updates . | OpenVDB / Ken: not a lot to update since last meeting, released 8.1, minor release with a long changelog, but not a “key feature” to call out. Deprecated support for version 5, only support 2 previous versions mentioned on VFX Platform. Planning a major release, version 9, probably won’t make it for SIGGRAPH but before end of the year. Will include NanoVDB. NanoVDB was branched off an old version of OpenVBD, this will be updated this week, but not yet ready to merge into main branch. Have had discussions with VFX Platform, agreed that “we are all confused about the policy”, last TAC SIGGRAPH was mentioned, but the policy is not written anywhere? Kimball: that’s part of the purpose of the discussion with Francois / Nick today. Maybe have more formal meeting around SIGGRAPH timeframe to discuss this? Ken: believe that version 9 should be stable enough for VFX Platform 2022. Unwritten policy to try to do one major release per year. Nick representing DNEG is transferring to WETA, will continue to represent on TSC, grooming someone else to represent DNEG on TSC. Should we have a global ASWF policy about project version support policy, or stick with per-project policy? . | OSL: Chris. No major updates since last time. For Open Source Days will do a joint update with MaterialX. Kimball: we should make sure Jonathan from MaterialX is invited to TAC meetings. OSL not part of VFX Platform for now. | Rust / Scott: still working on onboarding process, need to talk with OpenEXR project, gathering questions Rust WG wants to ask OpenEXR. Should be doing presentation at DigiPro, not a Open Source Days (not enough bandwidth for both events). | OpenEXR / Kimball: merged C bindings, in soft freeze. I/O optimizations. Would love to get statistics feedback for texturing applications in renderers. Does that have impact on Rust bindings? Major new feature in OpenEXR 3.1, no changes to C++ backend. Expect release in time for SIGGRAPH, and would like that to be target for VFX Platform 2022. Francois: ongoing industry discussions about camera metadata, perhaps via OpenEXR metadata, or OTIO. Camera metadata coming from camera manufacturers, as well as additional on set metadata. Conversations happening in ASC / MovieLabs / VES Tech Committee / … Kimball: Joseph has been working on a standard definition language, could just be comments in the standard header files and the documentation. Was trying to put it in as next round of ACES standard container spec, but may not be happening anymore. Not sure if it will end up in 3.1 . | USD WG / Cory: adoption round table at last session, as well as ongoing camera work. Michael Min: lot of movement in various project group around camera metadata. USD WG had round table discussion and some presentations, including Gordon at Autodesk about what is being done with USD, as well as various new studios. There was a recording, hopefully available. USD / CG Camera: activity on a number of fronts, trying to create continuity between on-set camera all the way through the pipeline. Involved in trying to get this metadata through various barriers through CG pipeline, and transferring into a CG camera. Get practical camera data through conform, ingest, into CG production, make it shareable. Information from onset cameras (spoken to all camera manufacturers, they are all enthusiastic). Getting 150Hz gyro data, richer data set than just 24FPS, get exposure to original, rich data set to get better motion blur for instance. Exposure to richer landscape of data, driving lots of conversations. Joshua: OTIO is very interested, questions about the right place to put the data, especially for data at different rate than the frame rate of the video, which may imply it doesn’t belong in the image data frames. | OTIO / Joshua: trying to “stay off the list” of VFX Platform for now, would be good to have a clearly written “policy” of what belongs in VFX Platform and why. Have policy to support back versions of OTIO (currently back to 2016). Asked about dropping Python 2.7 support in annual survey, answer was yes. Would like to be able to drop it in a newer version. Have a couple of speakers only for OTIO at Open Source Days, so interested in additional presenters about use cases. | OpenCue / Brian: working on updating scheduler, as well as Open Source Days talk . | OpenColorIO / Carol: will release 2.0.2 with some patches before SIGGRAPH, 2.1 for VFX Platform by end of August. PRs for these features are under review. ACES 1.3 gamut compression, and new set of OpenFX plugins are main new features in 2.1, more cleanups, CMake, Python Wheels fixes. Looking good for end of August release. Working on Open Source Days presentation and SIGGRAPH course. | D&amp;I / Carol: D&amp;I accepted candidates (20) are now on Slack, they start their Gnomon workshop of choice next week. Mentor volunteers should hear back next week. Will be doing a couple of events over the summer to connect with ASWF members (coffee / mixer). Got more people interested in programming / scripting / TD aspect than expected, will try to pair with mentors accordingly. | Asset WG / Wave: getting very close to legal agreement. Fruitful conversation with ASC who are doing StEM 2.0 (test / evaluation footage), they have funding and initial hosting home in Azure, but there is interest in putting that in ASWF if we offer a repo. Gave them the legal agreement, they are interested in the same issues, Creative Commons license was original idea, but non commercial clause makes that tricky. Eric: rumblings of contributions soon to come from Amazon, they have made a short film and looking at release some assets. Similarly Animal Logic, Intel has some VDB cloud data (what resolution do we want?). Cloud assets have a clear application to a specific project where they are applicable. For general 3D scenes, we don’t have a general process for acceptance, how do we judge if something is “film complexity / quality”. Hope to have this problem soon. Wave: people involved with projects are encouraged to go to page to specify what type of assets a project would be interested in. | . | OpenSourceDays updates . | Still working on confirming speaker slots . | John: final schedule should be posted online next day or two . | Ken: some emails went out today . | . | Slack upgrade . | Governing board has approved expenditure, will no longer lose Slack history | . | .

    "content": ". | Open Source Days update? . | John: most of you have been working with Rachel, we should be good there. Any questions? All seems good. | . | Project / WG updates . | Assets WG (Wave): Animal Logic have a USD assets they want to contribute, but don’t currently have a direct project we can go to TSC to accept a production grade asset. So up to the TAC to decide whether an asset is acceptable. Went to USD working group last week, anyone want to volunteer to look at assets? Got a couple of volunteers, Mark Tucker at SideFX (Solaris architect), second person (?), would like to get more people to look at. Darin from AL has made asset available yesterday. Eric: we haven’t accepted anything yet, so don’t have a process yet. Intel and Amazon both offered assets, but didn’t have someone to review USD yet. Eric: an asset like that isn’t only used for USD, can have multiple uses for all sorts of developers both in studios, commercial vendors, researchers. What’s the process to add the ASWF “imprimatur” to determine that an asset is representative of a film grade asset in 2021. But also need to get the process going with some content. Question for John: can the TAC vote to accept an asset for this? Do we represent the ASWF in this way? Kimball: will we have an asset project that tracks all these assets? John: the Governing Board approval is more about using the license (which isn’t an OSI license per se). But to make the decision of “what is a film grade asset”, would see in the context of the project that governs / oversee the assets and should be responsible for this. So maybe time to transition from WG to project, and what the project would look like. Otherwise the TAC has to figure out the ownership structure of these assets. Eric: accepting an asset might not have to be a TAC vote, it could be at the project , just like accepting a PR. So can we put something in short order to approve the submission, since AL would like to have this up and running by SIGGRAPH. Jonathan: is there already a shading model associated to this asset? Wave: this is the chicken &amp; egg with USD, they have a Hydra render delegate, but it’s been stripped off to provide a more generic USD asset. So it’s challenging to start with this. AL would like to get collaboration to develop other renderer bindings for the asset. Have been looking at it in different DCCs and USD View, there are lots of warnings. Hoping the SideFX volunteers will take a look at it. Eric: AL proposed there could be 2 versions, a vanilla version with standard USD Preview shaders, and a AL-specific version that would include future proposals. Jonathan: there are straightforward techniques to translate the shading model from proprietary to open source (presenting on that topic at SIGGRAPH). Can make a Material X binding. Eric: AL would have to be the ones doing this baking / flattening, doesn’t have to be perfect on day one. Kimball: this is where it fits the “project” model, different versions of an asset can be approved separately, with a TSC that can approve the versions. John: the project can make a determination of the qualifications on assets, and adopt the way the TAC can decide what is a good project. For turnover, if there’s a project proposal by the next TAC meeting, it could be accepted then. Eric: if the TAC wants to tell the current Asset WG, approvals can be done within the current WG membership. Vendors show up to a WG since they need the data to test the software, but studios may not. But looking to studio representatives to determine whether an asset is “film level”. Hoping for good representation from vendors and studios. Wave: so far we have 3 people who are from studios but at vendors now. Kimball: if the WG can write a project proposal, we can get this through at the next meeting before SIGGRAPH. | Material X / Jonathan. Main focus is prep for Open Source Days. 2 major contributions recently, a new set of BSD Graphs that were designed for RenderMan, means you can render the (LOMA?) nodes and preview, once committed and makes its way to USD repository, will be viewable in USD View (new version allows arbitrary Material X nodes). | OpenEXR / Cary: working on 3.1 release, mostly documentation at this point. Should be in good shape for next week, well in advance of Open Source Days. 3.1 is mostly Kimball’s work: new C language API for OpenEXR which is fast, thread safe. Trying to figure out how to communicate about this, but 100% backwards compatible with existing 3.0 release, purely an addition to the API. Missed the previous discussion with Francois/Nick about VFX Platform, but trying to get it in time to be adopted for next year. SO versioning is a pain, not easy to figure out, it’s more difficult than it should be. | OpenVDB / Ken: starting to review NanoVDB, still aiming for version 9, but not sure when it will drop, hoping to get into VFX Platform even if don’t make SIGGRAPH deadline. Gave a 2hr presentation, there’s an interactive viewer developed at NVIDIA which is useful but pulls in dependencies, so the viewer will go into a future release. 8.1 is wrapped up 2 weeks ago. SIGGRAPH long course, talk on NanoVDB, and prepping for Open Source Days. | OSL / Chris: discussed interactions between OCIO and OSL. Patrick Hodoul looking into this from number of angles, trying to figure out how the projects can play well together. Larry: this also implicates MaterialX. Jonathan: also have been having this conversation with Doug Walker. 2 paths: OCIO can start adding support for each shading language that MaterialX supports, but downside is already more than GLSL and OSL, and adding ESSL and SpirV. Or could emit MaterialX graphs directly. Haven’t come to a conclusion one way or another, but worth discussing. Michael: there’s an open OCIO GitHub issue about emitting OSL graphs. Jonathan: don’t want color transform support for just a subset of shading languages. It would be better if can decouple code generation from color transforms. Larry: that’s a MaterialX centric approach. But if you look at it from point of view of OSL inside renderer, MaterialX is on the outside, could require lots of steps involved. Don’t have a simple solution, but each solution imposes constraints on the other projects. Jonathan: would be nice if all ASWF projects one platform for color transforms, OCIO, and one platform for shader generation, MaterialX. But would make MaterialX a dependency of OCIO. Michael: GLSL support is optional dependency, can optionally build support module. Jonathan: right now MaterialX has to maintain every shading language it supports, so sticking to documented / open source shading languages. Shouldn’t be necessary for anything depending on MaterialX to know which shading languages it supports. Would have to be able to generate shading code from OCIO 2.0 configs for each supported shading language. | OCIO / Michael: also preparing for Open Source Days, and SIGGRAPH Long Course (that work is done and ready to go). Finalising 2.1 release, as well as 2.0.2 release around same timeframe. 2.1 has PR for support for imath 3 for half float support, recently merged support for ACES 1.3 gamut compression, starting discussion around OSL / MaterialX. Top of OCIO issues, looking for any thoughts on the topic. | D&amp;I / Carol: just had monthly meeting. Preparing for Open Source Days talk, somewhat different format, fewer slides, more people stories. Summer program going great. All “mentees” got tickets to Digipro and Pipeline Conference. Rachel: 20 great students, thank you everyone who helped with reviews and mentors. Students keen to learn about our industry and careers, got a lot of support. Gnomon has been fantastic, gave great discounts and free licenses. | OTIO / Josh: have been working with Autodesk to help move forward proposal to bring spatial coordinate systems into OTIO: aspect ratios, positioning of clips in 2D plane, maybe moving slower than they would like, but looks like good direction for OTIO to move in. Having code review / design meetings with Autodesk, who is being fantastic. Getting ready for Open Source Days, a bit behind on getting presentation ready, but have great contributors. A bit stuck with Linux Foundation and Pixar with wording of one of the TSC agreements, not sure how to get that unblocked. | Rust / Scott: sent proposal to OpenEXR Slack channel to move ownership of OpenEXR Rust bindings to OpenEXR TSC, looking forward to discussion at next TSC meeting. Also LF has ownership of crates on crates.io, need to add someone else to the ownership to allow someone else to push work, right now blocked with LF RelEng team, need someone from TAC to bless that request. Kimball: we can figure it out at tomorrow’s TSC (13:30 PDT tomorrow). | OpenCue / Brian: preparing for Open Source days, on track, have a few different presenters. Early design discussions for redesign of scheduler. Also focussing on docs refresh, looking for a tech writer to help with that. TSC members helping with that. | USD WG / Cory: working on OS Days presentation, will meet next week so may have more to update after that. | . | Lifecycle resumption . | Maybe have to wait after SIGGRAPH. John has updated the lifecycle document, idea that we review WGs and projects on a regular process, wrap up a WG, convert a WG to a project… We need to start doing this, good example will be proposal to convert asset WG to a project (adding to agenda for next meeting). | . | Talking through a WG proposal for real time “standards”, is it a good idea for this group or not . | Some people at WETA interested in talking about interchange “standards” for real-time applications like Unreal, Unity, how do we mix data that has different structure than what we are used to dealing with. But don’t know if this is a good / appropriate forum for this, or should it be handled outside of ASWF. But we are a collection of people who have a shared interest. | Jonathan: could be interesting to review which projects apply and don’t apply to RT projects. OCIO, USD have a level of acceptance in Unreal/Unity, could be another lens to view the projects represented here. Larry: these tools are becoming important in most studios, looking for interoperability, potentially very relevant. Michael: what do you want to get out of this discussion? There’s now a new LF Open 3D engine foundation starting up? What do we want to get out of this? Kimball: fundamental goal would be to determine if there are tools that need to be built, and how do we share data consistently. There’s a lot of overlap, and it’s unclear if we’re confusing our scope by trying to talk about an “interchange agreement” if there’s no code involved. But maybe there is code. Wave: this is now part about film and TV workflow, so it is a legitimate part of it. Michael Min: seems like a good idea, there is a convergence happening, could be a good discussion. Also help organize the conversation from our perspective so we can help groups that are setting standards. For instance camera manufacturers want to be the “master clock” on location, but they need to know what they are interfacing to. | JT : intersection of Open Standards and Open Source, discussion on #random channel in Slack. https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/a-revival-at-the-intersection-of-open-source-and-open-standards/ Author Guy Martin is in ASWF Slack, may want to invite him. | . | Jonathan: some developers at ILM have been asking about open sourcing a Maxwell shader ball, could be a good contribution to the asset repo, could potentially be all in USD. | Eric: will try to look at Project application form, and try to see how it can map to what the Asset WG is doing. Kimball: getting the TSC structure right will be the important thing. Also structure around setting up web / wiki pages to describe the use of the content. Michael: anyone interested can reach out to Eric / Wave to help. | . ",

    "content": ". | Asset Working Group proposal to become an ASWF Project . | Project Proposal - Asset Repo . | TAC mailing list thread . | Eric: What if assets are already licensed, if the standard license will be required, or a minimum standard? If we say “minimum license”, that’s easier for donors, but harder for consumers, for users they may need to go back to their legal department. But still, we want to be able to accept assets. | John: IP / copyright owners can make a donation under the project license (dual licensing), that works. Larry: that can work when coming from a studio, but for collections of assets from multiple contributors, can be difficult to relicense, contact everyone to agree. | Eric: even in a corporate setting, it can be difficult to get other licenses approved. Wave: another license should be more permissive (CC-0 for instance), and should be a known license. Internally at Apple, there’s a list of approved open source licenses. Joshua: should we have a list? Larry: probably don’t need to go that far, but maybe the wording needs to be clearer if it was at least possible that the project could accept a more permissive license. Wave: in order to be accepted into the repo, you will need to use the license, otherwise we can point you to other resources. Sean: ASWF asset repo is a minimum permissive, from a researcher point of view, it’s good to know what’s the “minimum permissibility”. | Eric: the asset repo TSC should make these decisions on a case by case basis, balance the factors, decide to host it, point to it, some kind of “film complexity” moniker. Gordon: where are we pushing the legal burden. John: the TSC can adopt a standard IP policy, and determine if they need to audit incoming licenses. | Michael: is it likely that if there’s a legal aspect to an asset that the company will even use the asset, or will they just make it on their own? Wave: this isn’t a backlot, they are assets purely for testing, demo and research. AL USD assets has lighting tied to their renderer, someone else could try adding other renderer / lighting engine. Sean: trying to get relevant assets from studios to researchers / developers so they can work on the latest assets that are relevant to the industry, and the license enables the release of assets without worrying that they are used for commercial production, doing so in a legal way that no one is exploiting the IP of the contributors. Kimball: want to enable hardware / software development, but how do we curate the assets, make sure they get “more complex” every year. | Wave: transition from WG to Project reflects that this is a non trivial activity, needs a more formal level of engagement. | Kimball: how much code do you imagine being in the repository? Would the Wiki be auto-built, would we need Apache 2.0 license for code infrastructure, or will it really just be text and assets? Wave: looking at the Moana example of a static set of web pages, wedge tests, but no “CI test suite when a new version of PBRT”. | Joshua: there may be code: shaders, build scripts… Wave: “those are in the tarball”. Joshua: we may still want to have guidance as to license for those. | Gordon: the value we offer here is a license that the parties around this problem agree to, get approval from legal team once, every company will still have to run this license by their legal team, but once this is cleared, it doesn’t need to be done again. Want to get critical mass of contribution under that license. Would be awkward if it became a barrier to contribution of great content, we strongly recommend that contributions be made under this license, but can still approve contributions under other specific licenses (there’s a cost to approving other licenses). We want to avoid a “zoo of licenses”, and it’s not trivial to determine “less” vs “more” permissive licenses. | Sean: can pick a few small number of licenses and clearly document those on the web pages. | Eric: there is value to a single license. Wave: one license, and a policy to possibly allow more permissive licenses? Gordon: a subtle change of a word can make all the difference to a legal interpretation. Eric: the TSC should have that distinction. Wave: took 6-9 months + many lawyer meetings + Governing Board meetings to get to the license we have, let’s not go back to the beginning. | John: the project itself should decide what it’s IP policy is. The project will probably want to lean on LF counsel for some of these decisions. Also consumers don’t use the whole repository, so the concern of having different licenses in the repository is less of an issue. But want to have a consistent downstream message about licensing, and not have to look up individual licensing terms for each asset. Wave: want to be equal on both sides, the producers and the consumers. | Eric: we should vote before we lose quorum. Bill: should define the life cycle of these assets, do they have an expiration date for instance. Sean: probably annual reviews. Statistics on downloads can help inform. Wave: can have open conversation about whether assets are still relevant. Gordon: there’s also value in seeing the evolution of assets over time: the current state of things can evolve over time, although there may be storage considerations / financial considerations. | JF propose, Wave second vote for adoption as incubation project. All ayes, no opposes or abstain, motion passes. Welcome to Asset Repo as an Incubation Stage ASWF project.. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Project updates (are we all good for VFX Platform 2022?) . | Rust WG: Scott. Small slowdown after SIGGRAPH, Anders adding support for cppmm under Windows, getting to a point where can hand over OpenEXR bindings to the OpenEXR project, need to coordinate with them so they have everything they need to take over ownership of the bindings. Reddit /r/rust thread about ASWF Rust effort. | MaterialX: Jonathan. Published first shared / public translation graph for MaterialX, others developed for proprietary use at studios. Lots of work getting close to wrapping up. Autodesk developing ESSL and EGL viewer. Setting up testing for that, making sure there’s a web page on GitHub Pages that can visualize materials. Khronos is developing GLTF BSDF, Adobe is developing MaterialX shading graph for their standard shading model. | OSL: Chris: no major news since SIGGRAPH, CI builds track latest VFX Platform . | OpenVDB : Ken: committing to releasing version 9 before Nov 1st for VFX Platform, otherwise will revert to 8. NanoVDB in review. Independent viewer will not be part of this release due to too many dependencies. Started having conversations with Autodesk Bifrost team, they have adaptive grid structure they want to contribute to the project. Looking at common complaint is long compile times when building against OpenVDB, was used in keynote at cppcon. Use template instantiation heavily, looking at instantiating templates in library files without breaking backwards compatibility to help client-side compile time. Kimball: OpenEXR ran into issues with symbol visibility, happy to share. | OCIO: Michael. Releasing 2.1 on Monday for VFX Platform, releasing 2.0.x bugfix release for current release. Have Python packages set up, can be used automatically with CI builds, will be able to pip install ocio. Sub WG is working on new ACES configs, including a studio config, “color pipeline in a box”. Working with camera vendors to supply CLF versions of their camera transforms to share burden of support with camera manufacturers. Previous ACES OCIO configs have been widely used, some have struggled to use them since they didn’t have explicit license, Thomas Mansencal has gotten approval from all contributors, so ACES 1.1 and 1.2 configs can move to main OCIO repo. | D&amp;I Carol: working on summer program, sending out swag soon. Rachel &amp; Carol &amp; Kimball had discussion with ASWF board for long range plans, how to affect diversity in the makeup of the board, alternates, term limits… ASWF board can be affected, view TAC as longer term goal. Larry: maybe the TAC is more amenable to substitutions since Board deals with money / legal issues, so often only one person in the company is allowed to deal with those issues? Would be great to see more diversity on the board, but there may not be someone to substitute? Carol: definitely not trying to “overturn” the whole board at once. Hopefully can start training someone else / avoid single point of failure. Kimball: we should grow the summer learning program into a mentoring program for instance. | OTIO: Josh. Also trying to get Python wheels built, making good progress towards that, trying to connect to OCIO to learn from their experience. Will make a lot easier to install, and reduce support load (lots of questions about compilation / installation). OpenTimelineIO was awarded the 2021 Pipeline Tool Award from the Pipeline Conference, congratulations to all contributors. https://thepipelineconference.com/2021/07/30/the-8th-pipeline-awards-winners/ Also may have “unstuck” legal issues to handing over repo to ASWF, specific question about moving repos from PixarAnimationStudios, also have some aux repos under an OTIO organization. So looking at moving main repo into OTIO organization, since may be creating a bunch more repos, which may be faster than having to “ask for permission” every time. But want to ask for feedback. Andrew: paid-for CI builders will be tied to ASWF GitHub organization, also JFrog, Docker Hub. Jonathan: was thinking of doing the same thing under the MaterialX GitHub organization? Is this the best way to do this? . | OpenEXR: Cary. In good shape wrt VFX Platform, 3.1 release out for a while, barring any disasters, that’s what will be in VFX Platform 2022. Focus to continue hardening that release, especially the new C core, in advance of others adopting it. Rust bindings will also take some attention. Someone (Aras Pranckevičius, one of Unity’s founders), contributed a suggestion of changes to ZIP compression levels with claims of more advantageous tradeoffs between file size and CPU usage / compression time, as well as issues to investigate a variety of new compression algorithms. All good and exciting, but how do we evaluate this, would be good to have a good set of benchmark images, we have some reference images, but don’t have confidence that they are presentative of what studios are likely to encounter. Get reports of build / runtime failures on architectures we don’t have access to. Not really CI related, but wish CI could reach more representative set of architectures that OpenEXR is run on. Larry: for test images, the Animal Logic USD scene has a huge EXR texture collection, not all the use cases, but it’s a big one, and there’s lots of large texture files in there, could be interesting for compression benchmarks. Ken: when reached out to VFX Platform about intending to release v9 end of November, they pointed out desire to support OpenEXR 3.1, so would like some assistance. Kimball: shouldn’t be too much of an issue? Ken: added a standalone version of OpenEXR in 8.0 so people could optionally compile library (dependency on “half”), but that’s now an issue. Can be discussed offline. Kimball: should be possible to completely inline the new half library. Cary: definitely don’t want this to fail! . | Asset WG: Wave: officially transitioned from WG to project, skipped last meeting due to SIGGRAPH, next meeting will be starting up as a project, will need to organize infrastructure. Can start spinning up real asset repo and start accepting contributions. Animal Logic USD asset is using the license from the Asset WG, Apple was able to download and examine the asset since license was already approved. Now we can stop talking about boring legal stuff and concentrate on exciting aspects. Intel, Netflix are offering up assets for acceptance. | Cory: USD: positive meetings at SIGGRAPH, meeting next week, USD Camera and Web Vis, shifting chairmanship to someone else in the group is being discussed. Would like to get a fresh perspective, raises the point of whether this is a WG, or more a user group / interest group. Do we have anything like that in the organization? Kimball: we need to review the WGs and projects periodically, we can discuss that at next TAC meeting. | OpenCue: Brian: work on improving version support, now support up to Python 3.9, makes it easier to support 2022 VFX Reference Platform, Needed to upgrade dependencies, PySide and gRPC, had to support versions with published wheels that support Python 3.9, also helps with cross platform support and makes it easier to install. Doing work around connectors that were written between OpenCue and Prometheus / Grafana / Loki, posted tutorial on OpenCue web site on how to use and integrate this. Wanted to highlight ability to connect to other services in a typical pipeline, as well as goal of publishing more context around the new features in OpenCue as they are released, and made those highlights of the Open Source Days presentation. | . | WG updates . | CI WG charter proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e-pPsNTKIgx3OwiQLhO8E5AuDVQyhtJJM6fVno8DnCE/edit . | JF proposes, Wave seconds. All ayes, no opposes or abstains, motion carries. | . | HxA proposal by Eskil (attached below) . | A simple file format for assets . | Why would we? . | Maybe we are a student learning graphics | Learning DX / Vulkan / OpenGL | A game developer building a custom engine | . | Options: . | Alembic: dependency only, not specified | FBX: dependency only, not specific, not open, C++ bindings only | USD: implementation only, scenes not assets. Companion format? | Collada: huge, XML, delivery only, dead | GLTF: huge, JSON, delivery only | OBJ: ancient, text, limited but implementable | What can I implement in less than an hour? | . | Load bitmaps is hard too: . | JPEG, PNG: are hard to implement | TGA and few others are trivial to implement | For graphics / GPUs we need 1, 3D, cube textures, arbitrary number of layers and channels. | OpenEXR solves part of this but not all. OpenEXR is not really implementable (ACES is) | . | HxA at its root is a number of nodes . | Number of nodes and array of nodes | Metadata only, Image, Geometry nodes | A layer is an array of UINT8, INT32, Float, or double | Use sign bit of integer index to indicate when a primitive ends, FBX uses same convention. | Can have a UV layer, edge layer (for creases), material ID | Metadata is a simple, JSON-like structure. Each object has a name, a type (INT64, double, node ID, text string, binary blob, or another metadata object). Can store anything. | . | The format is simple, and should be “implementable in less than an hour”. Format was implemented from scratch in Odin in 45 minutes. So can be thought of as an RFC, can implement yourself, or find an existing implementation that meets your needs. | What about everything else you might want to store? Can add “conventions”. If you have a special use case (say a physical simulation), can define your own convention, that way can share the conventions. | Does the world need another file format? Obligatory xkcd about standards . | HxA is meant to reduce the code you need to write. HxA is a file format, but also an in-memory representation. So when we write an application, can use an existing loader that loads into memory. What if you want to massage the data, like triangulate it. A utility can be implemented that takes a HxA file that triangulates and outputs a HxA file, same for manipulating image data. Some examples: . | Generate normals | Triangulate | Convert Types | Split vertices for GPU | Close holes | Validate | UV unwrap (“Ministry of Flat” implementation in HxA) | . | Can use existing tools to build a pipeline. What’s inside these utilities: . | Load HxA file | In memory | Utility function -&gt; HxA in memory | Saver | . | Why use external tool instead of reusing the open source function to operate in memory HxA -&gt; in memory HxA . | What if the data isn’t in HxA? Can use a file converter that reads some format into HxA, so can plug file converter into application. So not using HxA as a user, but more to connect various serious components: . | PNG loader /saver | TGA loader / saver | OpenEXR ACES loader / saver | FBX | TrueType | All in C, zero dependencies, more is coming | . | Drop-in open source, fostering open source and interoperability . | What about dynamic loading? HxA dynamically loaded code that can operate on data structures. | One plugin many DCC tools | Integrated with native UI | Scriptable | Can run in cloud | Possibility to build rich custom tools | Universal loaders and savers | Integrate existing code | . | Not a monolithic project . | HxA could benefit from . | More components | More domain specific conventions | Community of some sort | Application integration | Sample code / documentation | Does not need broad industry support to be useful (but would be nice) | . | A version of the presentation is available on YouTube . | Would be interesting as an incubation stage project, ASWF could create structure around the project that can’t be done as an individual. Would like to support implementations for a lot of the ASWF projects, ACES implementation was highly desirable. Looking to interact with other projects. Still very early on, looking for feedback. | Kimball: we need to think about how we create more tools for the industry, HxA could be an interesting framework for that. Larry: would be good to address directly what the organization would get out of having this project as a member and vice versa. | . | . ",

    "title": "Project name: HXA",
    "content": "Maturity level . Incubation . Project description . HxA is a convention for storing graphics assets. HxA is both a file format and an in-memory representation for graphics assets that is so simple that it’s reasonable for a developer to implement in about one hour. The goal is to make a graphics format that makes it easy to exchange assets, but also to exchange code by having a common data format. The format can store 3D meshes with arbitrary surface attributes, texture and meta data. In order to be as simple as possible it does not employ any compression, or complex encoding. While the format describes the fundamental building blocks, it relies on user conventions to store domain specific data. HxA is not a monolithic opensource project, but a collection of algorithms using the convention. Each algorithm is independent, so the user can choose to grab any parts they want or choose to write their own. Most of the code is in portable C, but the intention is to make it so easy to make HxA implementations in any language (An implementation in Odin has been made independently) . A partial list of existing HxA components available: . | File Loaders and savers | Text print outs | Hole closing | Triangulation | GPU optimizer | Normal generation | Validator | PNG loader/saver (Scratch written) | FBX parser (Scratch written) | OpenEXR loader (Scratch written) | True type loader (Scratch written) | . A further part the HxA project is the goal of writing a Universal Plugin interface that lets applications dynamically load code that operates on the HxA data structure. This would increase interoperability and enable applications to faster adopt new formats and workflows. ASWF Alignment . HxA is a project designed to foster collaboration, interoperability and opensource in the graphics community. HxA could make use of the robust organization that ASWF can provide to solidify and create processes for adding new conventions. HxA can also be a used to test and verify existing ASWF projects like OpenEXR and OpenVDB . Source Repository . https://github.com/quelsolaar/HxA . External dependencies .

    "content": ". | Hi to Shannon Deoul, working at PR agency RazPR, have been working with ASWF for almost a year, taking over PR duties in the interim for Rachel, new #public-relations Slack channel, can post announcement worthy updates to that channel, based in LA, can email at shannon@razpr.com . | Project / WG updates - especially: are we good with cross-project syncing (i.e. VDB + EXR) for VFX’22 . | OpenEXR (Cary) . | First attempt at supporting OpenEXR / imath 3.1 to OpenVDB, misses some stuff but can be used as a basis. All projects need to support multiple versions, which can be challenging. OpenEXR would like to help in any way possible, but hitting limits of knowledge of how OpenVDB is built. But want to help move the process forward. Kimball is raising the issue since we don’t want to miss the window of opportunity to get OpenVDB 9 in VFX Platform 2022 with OpenEXR 3.1 . | Ken: have you heard any response yet? Cary: there was some discussion on the PR about things that the PR doesn’t address. But should mostly just be taken as a indication of how to do this. Ken: wasn’t able to take part in TSC meeting yesterday, but will loop back with other members, should be a good starting point. In previous version of OpenVDB, was shipping independent / bundled version of ilmmath, do we still want to do this? Trying to eliminate as many dependencies as possible from the library, was able to do that with older version of OpenEXR by just copying half.h, used to have dependencies on many parts of OpenEXR, but only part that was part of the core was half, other dependencies was just for command line tools. | Kimball: in 3.1 there’s a header only implementation of half. Ken: so in principle could just include this header file as part of the repo to avoid having to build ilmmath as part of the dependency? Larry: is it internal to repo, or part of public API? Ken: right now it is internal, but thinking about making it public. Use it to write sparse grids to disk with compression, and decompress to full precision on read back. But clients want half float grid type at runtime, so will have to go into the API. | Kimball: probably best to have your own type then. We pulled out iMath to allow more people to use it without having to pull all of OpenEXR. But imath introduces ABI with a versioned namespace, so changes its namespace between releases (unless you use the C layer), but the C++ classes are namespaced. This is under discussion inside the group. | Nick: might make sense for OpenVDB to have its own type, make a note that it is IEEE half type compatible, as well as imath. But no real reason to have an exposed dependency / copied header? Ken: may have to do this now that it will be part of the of the public API. | . | OpenVDB (Ken) . | Still discussion of nanoVDB adoption, lots of experimentation with compile time template instantiation, trying to coordinate with OpenEXR to learn from experience there. Prototype is looking promising. Concern is to be able to still support custom voxel and tree types, how to balance the requirements, template instantiation of most of what OpenVDB uses, but still allow customization. Still trying to get this into OpenVDB 9. Still on track to release v9 by end of October to make VFX Platform deadline, including imath discussion. | . | MaterialX (Jonathan) . | Charter approved by Disney, so should be able to vote on that . | Looking at upgrading to pybind11, which will allow Python 3.9 (for now limited to Python 3.8) . | New release with shader translations and color space improvements. | Apple proposal for HTML element tag called “model”, designed to support 3D models in any browser without any additional support than what the browser supports natively, uses USDZ for geometry and MaterialX for shading. May affect choices we make for ASWF assets. | . | OSL (Chris) . | TSC meeting last week: good discussion with OCIO and their support for OSL, led to discussion about texture calls, will be handled by OCIO, but not clear where exactly that goes. Also some debate between people in large studios with rigid color pipelines with pre-prepared files, vs smaller studios and packaged apps that use JPGs, still figuring out best place for color management. | Larry working on input/output placement API for OSL, alternate ways to get data in and out of the shader, if you know your memory layout, can be compiled natively to avoid queries and get better performance. Extended eventually to shader globals, so won’t have to rely on struct layout in OSL API. | . | OCIO (Michael) . | Released 2.1 and 2.0.2, last day of August, so good to go for VFX Ref Platform 2022. Supports imath 3.1, OSL shader emitting code (still WIP / beta feature, but usable). | . | OTIO (Josh) . | Approval for TSC charter, one or two questions still to be resolved. One core TSC member out for 2 weeks, but should be able to vote on it soon. | Had productive meeting with Autodesk about proposed schema enhancements about image bounds, placement and layout in the timeline. | Open questions about VFX Platform, can we drop older versions? Claim to support back to 2016, but does that still work? . | Nick: hoping that reading of VFX Platform of “current + 3 past years” means we can concentrate on C++ 14, against the available CI . | Nick: have a substantial incoming PR from Autodesk, hierarchy of 2D transforms and objects representable in OTIO, decided to take towards using iMath instead of internal math library. Some discussion about what it means to integrate imath, may require new functionality from imath. | . | Assets (Eric) . | TSC meeting last week, formed TSC, Eric elected project chair, adopted the charter. | Presentation from Animal Logic on the ALab asset. | Other assets in the queue for consideration, sign up to come present to the group. Make the group familiar with the asset, what are your plans for it, how does it represent “film complexity”. | Next week, will vote on whether to accept Alab to next stage (“in progress” stage, still defining those). | Kimball: some discussion on the next ASC StEM? . | . | USD WG Update (Cory, via email) . | We discussed last week about changing up leadership of the group going forward. Alexander Schwank (Apple) will take over the primary chair role, with Michael Min (Netflix) and Nick Porcino (Pixar) acting as co-chairs, helping to wrangle meeting logistics, allowing for vacation outages without cancellations, etc. The group seemed happy with this direction. I am meeting with these folks later this week to work out initial logistic for the next regularly scheduled meeting next week. I will definitely continue to attend, both in support of the group leadership and as a community participant. | There was some conversation about whether the USDWG fits the definition of a ASWF “Working Group” – I mentioned this briefly at the last TAC meeting. It would be great to get some guidance as to how groups of this kind fit into the organization. How do the longer-term goals/deliverables of the USDWG compare to other long-term working groups like D&amp;I with regard to the definition of a “Working Group”. Is this more of a “User Group”? . | We also had a brief discussion spurred by Autodesk around USD/Material X integration, gathering interest for break-out sessions. | . | Rust WG (Scott) . | OpenEXR bindings on crates.io, people have started to play around with that. Next meeting on Friday, how do we want to announce the project officially. | Looking into handing over the bindings to the OpenEXR project, need to have a discussion as to how that works, what are the requirements on both sides. | . | D&amp;I (Carol) . | Just had monthly meeting: updated the group on recent discussions with the board, internal focus on D&amp;I for the ASWF organization. | Finishing up summer learning program, end of September. Mentors should have received emails with survey. | Rachel: talked about some more initiatives; blog posts, ambassador program which has been discussed in the past, will become primary focus for the group. | . | CI (JF) . | Updated Docker container 2022 platform has been released, used by OCIO | . | . | Continue discussion we abruptly ended last time around Eskil’s HxA project to wrap that up . | HxA is a on-disk and in-memory format, most existing formats are very complicated, HxA is meant to be simple. Has turned out to be a boon for personal projects. If it is going to be interoperable and used by others, it needs a home, and ASWF could be such a home. “A file format you can implement in an hour”. | See description from 2021-08-25 TAC meeting notes, also see YouTube video presentation. | Needs an actual specification, currently it’s mostly code, could use help with that (hxa.h mostly self documenting). | Larry: no “industry risk” with a simple format if the project goes away. But why not just make it an open source project and promoting it as opposed to a foundation project? Eskil: it’s already Open Source, for it to be really good, need conventions for various use cases, and have to think hard about those use cases. Having people who can figure out details of how to store particular kinds of data, that would be valuable to have from a group like ASWF TAC. | Nick: do you have support for time varying data, or strictly a sample in time? Eskil: can have infinite layers, so for instance for geometry can have blend shapes, or sequence of baked out animation. Can also store weights and animation data for rigging. Can also use tags to store bones system. Not sure how much of that want to define. But need a convention of how we want to store that. Don’t have convention for a flip book style geometry, but could just “do it”, put as many layers as you want and use those as frames. Nick: have a FBX converter on the GitHub site, so getting blend shapes and animation clips for animation from a FBX asset is always a stumbling block, for instance for USD migration. Eskil: agree, but there are so many use cases for storing geometry and images, you can find an expert on “skeleton animation” for instance, and have them figure out how to store that information. Hopefully we can have a simple format to get data in/out, and separately semantic understandings defined by experts. Ken: when you have parity / overlap with existing formats (say Alembic), have you done benchmarks? Eskil: HxA is probably slower, will often require fancy compression, “smaller is better”, but if you have to read a 500 page document to read a file… OpenEXR has lots of compressions, and if you need that, you might use the OpenEXR implementation to turn image into HxA file, and then use HxA to load into a quick hack, save to HxA and then back to advanced compression supported by OpenEXR. But that way you don’t have to parse OpenEXR. In terms of performance, “it’s fast because it’s simple”, but it’s not the most efficient way. For instance if you have animated geometry but where some data doesn’t change at every frame, that becomes complicated, and is great if you are intending to have a single implementation. OpenEXR can be complicated since it’s the definitive implementation. But ACES is supposed to be reimplemented many times, sometimes inside the camera, so simplicity is key. Usually hardware is fast enough to deal with large datasets, even if we have large scenes, we can do these in parts. Making conversions easy makes it easier to share pipeline steps, and avoid large dependency graphs of “big systems”. | Joshua: older systems have a lot of these attributes: EDLs, OBJ. Lasting a long time is very useful for archival purposes. Need the proper balance between “too simple” and “too complicated”. | Big question right now is whether adding half float is needed or not. | Kimball: how does it compare to GTO from Tweak Software? Eskil: looked at a bunch of formats, they seemed to all have a couple of problems. Too big, and a lot are only for delivery, like GLTF: all vertices are baked down, and discusses how to render. But maybe you want to load ML data into a GPU, could be completely different use case. There is already an Odin implementation from JengaFX, want to store 3D textures in 3D space. Nick: ILM / Lucasarts used GTO for a number of years, but ran into issues with time series, which led to Alembic format. | Nick: The lucas-patch can be applied on top of the ILM patches at git object f53fbb07f69a217a38da38250b5fadf81063eea7. The patch creates a new variant of GTO with a smaller header and some other changes to optimize its size. It’s unclear if applying this patch could be useful to anyone outside its original context. | Eskil: talked to Alembic team, they are working on documenting it, hoping to write Alembic implementation for HxA. | Joshua: if ASWF had existed when GTO was having issues, do you think that would have gone in another direction? Nick: yes, GTO got snagged on the fact that it was a proprietary format that was shared, but what would be the future direction, and would any local changes ever be supported. The “sharing mindset” didn’t exist back then. Joshua: GTO was “in use”, but there was a support problem, whereas HxA is brand new and looking for implementation. Nick: GTO hit the sweet spot for a game developer, had nothing fancy. | Kimball: some people should go away and take a closer look. Eskil: will also share email if anyone wants to reach out directly. Kimball: whatever ends up being the final decision, we want to support new project proposals. | Kimball: action item to look at how it fits in the mission of ASWF, don’t want to cause confusion with existing formats, even if we like and appreciate the goal of simplicity. Eric: would be good to have committee guidance about the definition of software layers. The “termcap problem”: very flexible metadata formats can’t be consistently read by different software (if at all). Larry: any project can assemble its own TSC, even outside the scope of ASWF. Projects can incubate somewhere else, emulating ASWF project structures. ASWF TAC is definitely the right place to pitch the need for such a project. | . | Related, revive discussion around software / project / working group lifecycle and review . | Want to do yearly reviews for projects and WGs . | Will probably start next time by wrapping up the Python 3 WG, then move on to other projects / WGs. | Robin: is there time to propose new project? . | Not sure where it should go? . | WHO has a project to create 10K models for an open source medical library: human body, medical equipment, hospitals… WHO is an NGO so it can be open sourced, have budget, but need to find 3D modellers, is there an umbrella organization that could be over that? . | Kimball: we would need to think about that, it’s not clearly under the mandate of ASWF, can you write up a proposal so we can think about this? . | . | . | .

    "content": ". | Quick callout for the README article . | Magazine / Blog from GitHub, there’s an article on us: How open source software powers modern filmmaking Has a number of contributors from ASWF. Shannon: will be pushed out on ASWF social channels. | . | Project updates . | OSL: Chris. New logo has been accepted, https://github.com/mariovario/OSL_rebrand including flavors for various uses. | OpenEXR: Cary: another stab at integrating OpenEXR 3 into OpenVDB, seems to be closer to what the project needs. Stands out as highest priority to make sure that OpenVDB doesn’t run into any issues with their upgrade path before VFX Platform deadline, so that’s moving the process forward. Issue raised by Kimbal: OpenEXR has always had a policy / mechanism of embedding the entire library in a namespace that is optionally but by default named by minor release. So for instance OpenEXR3_1 namespace. So an app can link 2 versions at once, but every release is ABI incompatible since all symbols in a new namespace. Discussion about “how to split the difference” and how to use namespaces in the context of an evolving library, while being able to release a new version without forcing all clients to recompile. On the backburner as a point of contention. Get pleading comments from various downstream distribution packagers to not be constantly changing the ABI. Chris: tools to check the ABI compliance. tools to check ABI compliance Larry: guidance from VFX Platform is that we should support 3 years back, which can be difficult to do. So it can be attractive that if there’s a problem with OpenEXR 2.4, the solution could be to upgrade to 3.1 with all the fixes without breaking anything else. Kimball has proposed a complex way to address this by preserving old APIs as we add new things so we could do substitution without breaking Maya plugins still looking for older symbols. Still compatibility walls when retiring old APIs. If executed well, could eliminate the need to support very old versions, where “upgrade to get the fixes” could be the solution. Kimball: so we would maintain ABI backwards compatibility for 3 years. We have played with ABI compliance checker before? Cary: don’t recall. Gordon: we run that checked on Maya for those reasons. What about TBB? They have a name space for forward / backward compatibility? Kimball: TBB has a C core and a lot of inline headers, similar to new core in OpenEXR. Gordon: could be a good idea to write a best practice white paper. Cary: nothing truly unique with OpenEXR in this respect, except that it is used in many applications. Kimball: time to assume the fact that OpenEXR needs to be a stable library. Good idea to write a summary / white paper. Chris: https://lvc.github.io/abi-compliance-checker/ . | Rust WG: Scott: tomorrow, talking with OpenEXR project to double check what are the conditions for moving the bindings to the project, and working with ASWF PR to create an announcement for this project. Kimball: do we have ownership of the crates? Scott: yes, it’s been sorted out. | OTIO: Josh: no major updates . | OCIO: Michael: have a WG working on next gen ACES config, in the process of trying to get the studio config in process, “color pipeline in a box”. One of the aspects is planning to work with camera vendors to provide input xforms in Common LUT Format. Will present at ACES IDT WG meeting, to collaborate with ACES on this. Having lots of camera formats in CLF format would benefit more than OCIO. At TSC meeting, discussed moving default to C++ 14, since OSL and OIIO have moved to that. Also discussing GitHub Packages to do artefact storage accessible from GitHub Actions. Would like to have pre-built binaries for common platforms. It helps when services live within the same ecosystem, but can look into Artifactory as well (GitHub Packages may be a free tier + paid options?). Larry: can change internal build mode to C++ 14, while preserving an external C++ 11 external ABI. | Assets Repo: Eric: had TSC meeting last week. Discussed procedural issues, several potential assets in the pipeline, looking to get them cleaned up. Intel has volunteered cloud data and 3D scene, Dreamworks interested in providing data demonstrating pipelines, AWS short film “Spanner” can contribute character rig, Michael talking to ASC StEM, some concern about licensing of downstream modified versions of the material. Wave: owe the producer an email on this topic. Not clear if we’re the right fit for the level of control they want to have over the material. Eric: would like to plug what assets projects would like to have to test, please add your needs to the list: https://wiki.aswf.io/display/ARW/Wish+List . Need to build web site and landing page. | USD WG: Cory. Had meeting last week with new chair. Presentation from Apple on proposal for HTML model element, support for ARKit. Robust discussion, detailed notes in the minutes. | D&amp;I: Carol / Rachel, no major updates (conflict) . | CI WG now has an official repo. VFX Platform 2022 containers are up, work continues on supporting Conan via JFrog Artifactory to store pre-built packages. Discussions on automated ChangeLog generation from PR comments (“Conventional Commits”). Impact of Travis CI credentials leaks on ASWF projects that might have once used it and still have a live Travis organization with secrets. Kimball: for 2022 containers, something that came up in OpenEXR, how do we want to maintain the build matrix of all the things we compile again (gcc vs clang vs VFX platform years). Could this matrix somehow be centralized for access by other projects? . | Review WG: Larry: there are 2 tracks, the player / review tool we’ve been discussed since the beginning. Proposal from Imageworks to make interchangeable modules that collectively make up a playback and review tool, also modules from DNEG, trying to line up people in different timezones and legal requirements. Also a track on the topic of how annotations should work for media, there’s an interesting discussion under way on that topic. | . | Eric: Color management is a topic coming up everywhere, discussed in OSL, MaterialX, etc, so wanted to raise a “heads up”. In OSL, observation that needs of large studios are quite different from needs of small studios, rigid and elaborated color management policies, everything is linear by the time the renderer sees it, whereas smaller studios may need more flexibility. There are valid questions about where a DCC should let you “shoot yourself in the foot” vs restricting choice. Unrelated to the Asset project, but have been hearing those conversations in different project contexts. Kimball: how to get input textures into OSL. Chris: coming from MaterialX side, they have decided to expose some flexibility in texture lookups to chose your color space, similarly USD wants to tag color parameters with color space, which can lead to a proliferation of color transforms in different places. JT: game engines and VR also starting to get into it, color issues are more important as shaders become more physically based and complex. Invited someone from Open3D game engine to discuss with OSL. Convergence between the different media production fields. Michael Min: use color workflows as an example of who manages the .ocio file, how does it get customized per shot. Michael Dolan: primary objective of WG is to create a collection of standard-ish OCIO configs that can be used by studios (not necessarily verbatim). Tools to generate configs from base configs, and providing examples of how studios can use them. Hopefully these can be useful tools. Chris: is there guidance about how color management concepts should be exposed in DCCs? If you have a texture node in your shader, should it have a color space drop down? Kimball: whenever you get a JPEG, you don’t really know what color space it’s in, even if you have a menu of choices, you don’t really know which to pick. Michael: working on developing a document in ASWF wiki will be UX guidelines around OCIO, and how to implement color management in different aspects of an application. Ongoing / in progress project, still has ways to go. Chris: have to be aware of places where UX guidance can bleed into a file format. Eric: if there’s a colorspace stored in a file and a colorspace option in the texture fetch, how do these combine? Does the texture fetch operator have both “from” and “to” color space args? . | Scott: a group of people are interested in creating a Pipeline working group, so would be interesting to talk about color management in the context of a pipeline, so potentially another avenue to tackle color management. Larry: what’s the scope of “pipeline” here? Scott: main scope is to actually define what is a pipeline is, what’s an asset, what’s a shot, and from there create a reference implementation of that spec. Initial idea is to create the spec, a bare bones implementation, and then build upon that, and hopefully get to the point where a new pipeline could be adopted by a new studio. Larry: does that include versioning, publishing… Could be all encompassing? Scott: still lots of discussions about “where the interest lies”. Gordon: is that somewhere we can read up on this? Scott: all under the #pipeline channel in ASWF Slack, some documents have been set up to start a conversation. Have 1 or 2 people working on a proposal to send to the TAC. | Python 3 WG as a lifecycle review item. Kimball: we should celebrate and wrap up the Python 3 WG, we may not have quorum for that today. JT: have been talking part, worked on some deliverables, things are being done in studios. Ashley could articulate this the best. Kimball: people are starting to convert to Python 3, Weta has a couple of environments running Python 3. JT: there should be an announcement of what the WG came up with, need to publicize the work that was done. Kimball: do you feel that the group has run its course, and it’s time to “celebrate” the work that got done? JT: the group isn’t meeting regularly right now except on ad hoc basis. Kimball: Python3 WG on the ASWF web site is pointing to the CI WG. If we want to take on more working groups such as Pipeline or Virtual Production tooling, we should possibly not form more and more, but instead finish up some of the existing ones. | . ",

Created some of the initial deliverables: . | Skeleton 2 to 3 transition guide for studios | . | Communication between studios and with vendors, the studios seemed to be mostly saying “we haven’t done anything yet”, being aware of the progres from the studios would have been useful, but not enough to justify monthly meetings. | Larry: what do we need to do going forward? John: looking at the WG lifecycle and processes, if the WG says they are done, they are done, the TAC can shut it down. The TAC can vote to accept that. Ashley: there was a discussion about the shutdown process for a group, which is why the WG hasn’t shutdown yet since there was no process yet? John: it’s a decision of the TAC as to whether it’s complete is not. Larry: there isn’t really much alternative to “force” more work. Ashley: could decide there are things the group hasn’t covered. There should be ongoing communication with vendors for Python 3 support. Gordon: the TAC decided to start this process, we can do a recap as to what was achieved, maybe the WG isn’t the right vehicle, or not the right set of members, or maybe we decide it’s done. Would be good to have some kind of process to review what was done and see if anything can be learned from it. Michael: might want to keep alive things like Slack channels for archival purposes? John: not a lot of guidelines, the group can decide what it feels is appropriate. Eric: could a short document be part of this? Larry: would be nice to get a summary of where the major players are, and a recap of what got done. What’s the current state of the world in the Python 3 transition. Ashley: yes, can present what got done, what are the loose ends. Larry: are there ASWF or close projects that still don’t support Python 3 / blockers that need resources / attention, or is it just at the studio level to continue fixing up their code? Ashley: no known blockers in terms of OSS projects, lots of vendor provided software that wasn’t Python 3 compatible yet. But since studios are so far behind in the process, so it’s hard to tell that the Python 3 support in OSS projects is working since there may not be enough users yet to find any outstanding issues. | Larry: we’ll table for now, since we’ve decided there should be some kind of final report. | . | Rust . | Larry: Rust WG close to having a first deliverable, next project of what to “rustify”. Discussions about short vs long term goals. | Scott: looking at USD as next target, which is a large project. Also looking in the short / medium term would be OIIO and Ptex. Still working on wrapping up OpenEXR, getting ready to announce what has been accomplished publicly, would like to thank Shannon for writing the blog post. Draft in Slack channel, comments are welcome. Should have a final version on Friday, so should go out sometime this weekend. | LG: some projects have complicated C++ interfaces that don’t necessarily map to a Rust-style interface? Scott: planning on “unsafe Plus” APIs, some APIs in C++ are hard to get the Rust compiler to agree that memory usage is safe, there are ways to do this, but will require lots of time / energy / research, will need more people to support the project, Rust developers + project members to help create safer APIs, but without dropping important use cases. | Larry: canonical example in OpenEXR for a difficult to make safe interface is one that has been a “thorn in our side” which is scheduled to be replaced and causes issues with multi-threading. So things that the Rust group has issues with may be good feedback to the project since it may help C++ users as well. So think about where problematic C++ APIs may be improved. Scott: yes, that’s also a long term goal, working with C++ side to make sure “everyone wins” . | Gordon: where are we at in terms of Rust in the industry? Still in the “early part of the hockey stick”, are there good references? Scott: still early on in our industry, people are interested in memory safe languages in our industry, but missing some of the basic packages. So hoping to be a spark. Outside M&amp;E, starting to be used a lot, Amazon / Google / Microsoft are all looking at Rust. Gordon: does the project understand where there is the most value for it? Scott: anywhere C++ is appropriate, Rust could be applicable. Larry: hard to know where this is going, there’s a “chicken and egg” problem, individual studio developers are very interested / intrigued, but so little things can be done in Rust without the core libraries, will the efforts of the Rust group help to kick start / enable the process, allowing us to seriously look at it. JT: younger / up and coming developers are using Rust, so can be important to help attract young talent. | Gordon: trying to understand what the real shape of the integration of an existing C/C++ library, we used SWIG for Python integration, but how Pythonic was that? What are the big hurdles, where are there code inefficiencies due to automation. Scott: happy to talk one on one, via #rust Slack channel, or can set up Zoom meeting. | . | Packaging talk? (LG) . | Someone who helps package OIIO / ASWF for Fedora was “venting” a bit due to issues with cross package dependencies, and how distro packages view these projects, what we do that makes their lives difficult, and what could we do to make life easier. Could we invite someone like that to present? What are the patches they need to apply? There’s definitely some education that could help on our part. Is that something generally desirable? Should it be here or in the CI group? Can we get project representation at the CI group? Christina: better to have it in this group to get better attendance. Larry: will reach back to this person, and we’ll see where we get. | . | Project/WG updates as needed . | OpenVDB/OpenEXR status . | Required release for VFX Platform . | Ken: going well, convinced will make the deadline. Still polishing a version ready to go out, allows to build against OpenEXR 3, also a version of Half included in the library. | Making good progress on NanoVDB integration, should make it into V9. | V9 will definitely make it with OpenEXR 3, 99% sure it will have NanoVDB. | Looking at improving build times, some uncertainty as to whether it will make it in time (explicit template instantiation). Some optimizations for offsetting nodes. | . | Assets (Eric): moving forward on a number of possible assets . | OpenCue (Brian): . | Discussions on tweaks to scheduler performance, when the scheduler is under high load, some PRs outstanding that solve the problem in different ways with some overlap, trying to figure out best way to go forward. Also mindful of planned scheduler rebuild. | Response to user feedback, want to plan out new user and permission system, most popular request, similar to scheduler rebuild, moving discussion and gathering requirements. | . | OTIO (Johsb): . | Release planning, contributions that haven’t made it into an official release. | Nice write up in integrating OTIO into Blender for sound integration. Nice to see community using OTIO . | A TSC member is out right now so haven’t moved on admin items . | . | OpenEXR (Larry): . | Bugfix release 3.1.2 . | Cary working on helping OpenVDB with OpenEXR 3 integration . | How to keep from breaking ABI on yearly releases, is there a way to do better at long term ABI compatibility, Kimball has made a few proposals along those lines. One the verge of trying to tackle. | Eric: what about the CLA document issue? Nick: README refers to the 2.1 document, but still carrying the 2.0 document, and there may be inconsistencies between those two. Larry: thought we were now in sync with the other projects? Christina: also thought we were on 2.1? Nick: all organizations seemed to be OK with the 2.1 document, but one organization may not have signed off yet. Larry: we’ll wait for Cary to be back and coordinate. | . | . | Question about MaterialX + USD (mmin) . | Michael: this has come up in USD wg, looking for some guidance as to guidance from MaterialX, is there someone from this project they can reach out to and discuss these issues? If anyone from MaterialX can reach out, that would be great. Gordon: someone reached out to Jonathan Stone, would be great to have a good round trip support between USD and MateriaX that would be great, and Autodesk would be happy to help. Is there a more formal way that could be supported, maybe through a joint WG. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | VFX Platform 2022, Nov 1st Cutoff date . | OpenEXR: Cary: all in the clear, helping OpenVDB with their work, seems to be over the hurdle now. Should be in good shape. | OpenVDB: Ken: everything in 9 is there, except for one small thing that will be detailed. NanoVDB, OpenEXR 3, template instantiation (faster builds), a few other improvements. New TSC member, Richard Jones from DNeg, Nick now representing WETA. Had interesting meeting with a company on the East Coast doing extremely high resolution printing of human organs, heavy OpenVDB users. Probably highest resolution sparse volumes we’ve seen. Using OpenVDB bindings inside Mathematica, very impressive demonstration, they are considering contributing these bindings. Could ask they present to TAC? What is DLP 3D Printing? The Complete Digital Light Processing (DLP) 3D Printing Guide . | OCIO / Michael: ready to go for VFX Platform 2022. Looking for opinions on switching default branch from master to main to follow GitHub best practices and promote inclusiveness, have other projects done this? GitHub supports branch renaming, remapping links. Jonathan: MaterialX did this 6 months ago, it was a smooth process, just have to get over muscle memory of typing “master”. Michael: will implement soon. About to release 2.1.1 and 2.1.2, ongoing discussion about long term issue of local-specific parsing of floating point numbers, especially when reading LUTs. So for instance a comma instead of a dot for floating point numbers. Considering use of fastfloat open source library which implements support from C++17 back to C++11, looking for any opinions on this. Larry: OSL had this issue a couple of years ago, saved files read in different locales would be interpreted differently. Had to root through the code base (did OIIO as well), discovered how many things in the C/C++ standard libraries depend on locale in subtle ways. Didn’t have to look at fastfloat, most output through format library, which is locale independent. Michael: looking at fastfloat as interim solution (header only, so also faster parsing). Could switch to native support when C++17 becomes baseline. Performance impact not so crucial when just reading LUts. Will make a call at next TSC meeting. New TSC member, Remi Achard from DNeg, actively contributing for some time, now a committer on the project, can help manage PRs. Kimball: can you write up notes on master to main conversion? Had talked about doing this in OpenEXR but haven’t gotten around to it, so could use some notes. Cary: this has fallen off our radar, was waiting for official support from GitHub . | OTIO Joshua: planning to do master to main last week but got delayed, seems to be seamless from what we hear. For VFX Platform 2022, all CI building wheels on 2022 version, need to double check builds against VFX Platform versions we say we support. Taking guidance to support current + 3 previous years, but need clarification on what “current” means. Working towards a release, a few small issues remaining, it’s been over a year since the main previous release, will be good to have an official release out there. Good conversations with Blender (film) project to get sample assets, they are generating lots of revisions of their work, looking forward to having access to this data. | OSL Chris: discussing with Animal Logic their fork of OSL from a few years ago, looking at moving back to the official release, how to merge their changes back in (which also span OCIO). How to bring those improvements back into the release. Larry: some of those are really good ideas, the fact these are getting contributed back has inspired new ideas that build on those, an example of a “triumph of open source”. Some are large performance improvements and interesting new ways to look at problems. Thanks to Animal Logic for contributing these changes back, it will be very beneficial. Chris: will also do the master to main rename, it had fallen off the radar, but will take it on with GitHub official support. GitHub Renaming Existing Branches . | MaterialX Jonathan: clear of any VFX Platform 2022 issues, need to make sure we support the required previous versions. Released MaterialX 1.38.2 with Shader Translation Graph work from last 6 works, something from Renderman, visual improvements from GGX and (something) Sheen. Subgroup from USD WG to discuss USD and MaterialX integration and alignment, first meeting last week, seems promising, a lot of interesting ideas coming out of that. Continuing to contribute with glTF Shading Model and Adobe Standard Shader model. | Asset Repository: Eric: Defining our process, putting together a submission form, 1 or 2 paragraphs, why is this important / useful. Want to balance not burdening generous donors so we make sure we “know why we’re doing what we’re doing”. | Rust WG: Scott: had official blog post and made announcement on Rust community channels, thank you Shannon. Got more interest in Rust WG, will see what happens at the next TSC meeting. Binding work is chugging away. | D&amp;I Carol: had meeting working with the Board on term limit, self identification survey for board members, deciding what’s important to track. Starting with the Board, hopefully at some point moving on to TAC and TSCs, should hear more about this in next couple of weeks. Participants in Summer Learning Program should have gotten their swag! Thank you for your participation, was a successful program, will present to the board as to the accomplishments of the program. | Review &amp; Playback: Erik: in a bit of a “reboot”, trying to reschedule recurring meeting in a time which is friendlier to Europe and India contributors, likely 9AM Pacific time, hoping to get something out some time this week. Both Sony &amp; DNeg interested in contributing to an Open Source project, also the ftrack people may be interested in contributing some of the cinesync code they recently released. Working around the paperwork required for these companies to exchange their code. Second track is standardization and encoding, lead by Sam Edwards, reaching out to industry to look at standards for encoding (ffmpeg), how to exchange media, metadata and color information. Is Open Annotation the right vehicle to standardize this work? Not a ton of activity in the last month due to legal stage paperwork between companies and contributor vacations. | CI: Andrew: GitHub Actions haven’t released custom instances yet (Ken asking about TPU support), so will be able to do GitHub Actions on GPU instances for instance. M1 builders are still coming, but don’t know when. Ken: NanoVDB will use GPUs. Michael: GPU builds don’t work from PRs due to GitHub secrets sharing, so run it once merged (GPU builds through Amazon Codebuild). Update from JF about VFX Platform 2022 containers, looking at support for GitHub Actions standard build matrix. | . | Python 3 working group closure . | brain-storming session - bring your thinking caps! . | Have a few different topics, so will keep it mysterious . | Next Year Goals collaborative document . | How do expand our base so it’s not always the same people working on projects . | Is there a better way for the TAC to go over projects and WGs . | How do expand the base of projects, become a wider community . | Added a couple of starting points in the document . | Larry: it’s been a long time since we’ve asked if all the members are allocating their engineering contributions to projects? Do we know what the status is? In the first couple of years, we said we would be lax about it, are all the premier members fully allocating their FTEs? Kimball: not sure we have a good answer, it has come up in the governing board, if there are ideas on how to do this, it could go under project lifecycle review. Erik: think we are “doing the right thing” at Netflix, not being tracked super closely, but “sounds about right”. Larry: that’s more than sufficient, was more wondering if there are companies that haven’t found a way to contribute? We don’t need a formal accounting of it. Wave: everything we contribute has to go through a formal process, OpenEXR, OpenCIO, have “situational awareness” of contributions since we have a more formal process for code contributions, need to get legal involved. John: LFX Insights can be a tool for keeping track of this. Looking at organization commit diversity, gives you a sense of who is active and who is not. Can be a good tool to understand footprint? Larry: those numbers, they don’t seem off? John: that’s possible, there may be some git artifacts. Gordon: contributed a huge internal component to OCIO v2 that could have been attributed to a single person? There are some large sample LUT files. John: all projects are different, some people do lots of single line commits, vs one large squashed commit. So LFX Insight may not be accurate, but it’s a good starting point. Patrick: at some point we pushed lots of unit tests with LUT files to have parity between OCIO and SyncColor, so that made the number of changes not relevant. Larry: a lot of prolific contributors seem to only have a few Ks of contributions reflected in the LFX Insights numbers? Patrick: lots of PR doesn’t mean it’s a lot of work… . | Larry: sometimes it feels its still the same small group of people touching our projects, there has to be other people. Kimball: we don’t necessarily want to deal with cross industry and remain focussed on M&amp;E, but do we need to do this to grow our user base, even if it’s different areas of M&amp;E? Carol: there is a lot work internally we could do to set baselines to make it easier for new contributors to start, projects have done a lot of work, but it can be hard to get new developers up and running, since our projects are still very much niche. Discussion in D&amp;I group on how to set baseline across the board expectations on documentation and how to get a new contributor up and running, we aren’t in a bad spot, but it’s still challenging to attract new contributors. | Ashley: a lot of open source only have one or two main maintainers, difficult to find the people who will be consistently dedicated to a project. Kimball: is this driven out of excitement? Is this someone’s personal itch to scratch? Ashley: when you start a project on your own, it’s “your thing” and you want to stick with it. Sometimes after a while someone else can pick it up. It’s hard to start on something that’s already quite bit / established. Scott: when starting on a C++ project, can take quite a while to get environment set up. In Rust WG, creating a Visual Studio container system so you can get going on development as quickly as possible. Make it really easy for someone to just pick up and start developing. Have systems and documentation in place to allow this to happen. Ashley: after you start as a new developer on a project, can be hard to move on to the “intermediate” stage after you’ve worked through some “good first issues”. Scott: when handing over maintenance to a new person, how to deal with more demanding users. Larry: our projects seem to have a pretty reasonable / kind set of users? Erik: also the issue with volume and frequency of contributions, can be hard for a small group of core contributors to get overwhelmed. Ashley: IM / Slack does help a lot. | Cary: interesting to explore why we do this. We do it because it’s fun, we need it in our day job, small step to be involved with the community. Also a sense of stewardship, don’t want a project to fail. Comes out of a sense of ownership, can be hard to cultivate. Have made several attempts to draw other people in, a lot of my contributions are administrative, things that anybody could do, but you have to want to. It’s not easy to transfer that kind of desire for stewardship to someone else. Eric: does it help to know the context / use cases, why something is done the way its done? Or are there plenty of people who understand it but feel it’s not their problem? Cary: outstanding issue is to transfer TSC meeting notes from GitHub to Confluence, it’s not an interesting task, but for the health of the project and organization, has to be done. Hard to find someone to do this. Larry: can be the other way around, where there are people working on the code and interesting puzzles, they get interested in the health of the project, so they may be motivated to do some of the more administrative stuff. It’s not the other way around, you don’t go from administrative tasks to being enthusiastic about the project. | Scott: all ASWF projects are “boring in a good way”, foundational components that you typically don’t think about unless you need to. Most of the really interesting projects are layers built on top of projects like ASWF projects, the type of people interested in these projects have to be interested in the “full stack” of what you need to build fun / interesting projects. | Ashley: handing off bug triaging is one thing larger projects can hand off these tasks that core contributors may not want to do, and can be a good way for newer people to get to learn the code. | Kimball: many of us are working on things that have IP issues attached to them, should we be doing more reference implementations of important industry standards? That way we don’t have to worry about IP issues so much. Do we have a list of such standards that could use a VFX-friendly implementation? Scott: when you join a new studio, what are the things you need to build from scratch? There’s a pre-WG on pipeline tasks, figuring out what they want to send to the TSC. | Kimball: would like to continue thinking about this as we near the end of the year, figure out how as ASWF we grow, expand and stay relevant . | . | Current state of Next Year Goals document: . | .

One issue was getting CI to pass, Nick dived in, and looks like we only have 2 threads. Is there any way this could be bumped up to 4? Current CI takes 2-3 hours, can be an issue when lots of people are submitting PRs. Had to go in and manually kill jobs. Kimball: that’s the option that GitHub gives you. Andrew: may or may not be possible, but breaking down the job to be more parallel. Larry: no, need more threads in a single matrix entry. GitHub runners limit you to 2 cores. Andrew: we are limited on the size of the instances. GitHub has said that selectable instance sizes should come up before the end of the year (would need to be paid for -&gt; cost passed through via LF). Larry: you don’t need every PR to run every entry in test matrix, so pick a smaller number of representative matrix entries to run on every PR, and then run the whole matrix nightly to get full coverage, while still getting faster turnaround for PRs during the day. Ken: looking into this approach, also looking at caching not to have to build everything. Larry: yes, caching helps a lot. Ken: the firm deadline meant everyone was submitting at the same time, and CI builds weren’t finishing. Larry: used to use Travis and Appveyor, those had the feature to be able to kill individual matrix entries, so could let a specific entry finish by killing others, whereas for now GHA only allows killing an entire run. | Would it be a good idea to invite Nick and Francois again to talk about a strategy for 2023? Ken: would be a great idea, one request is that the VFX Platform highlights specific versions of packages, for OpenVDB can define the API, so for instance can build OpenVDB 9 with API 8, so would be interesting if the platform could also specify the API version. Kimball: other issue is how to deal with sub dependencies such as PNG, Zlib… Would be good to find a way to define the ABIs of these sub dependencies. Scott: also would be good if it said something about build environment: what’s the namespace for dependencies, trying to build for all the apps (Maya, Nuke, Houdini) can be problematic. Kimball: we should schedule a time to meet with VFX Platform again some time in the new year. | Overall, congratulations, much better state than last year. | . | TAC chair . | Kimball will be joining Governing Board of ASWF, but can’t vote twice as TAC Chair and as Governing Board member for WETA. Have to refresh TAC chair in December, will still be TAC member, but can’t be the chair. Larry: if we keep you as TAC chair, could you just have 1 vote on the board instead of two? Wave: Governing Board votes typically not close. Kimball: yes, but this is also decorum. Would like to give someone else the opportunity to be TAC chair, if I remain the TAC Chair, should nominate an alternate who can sit in on Governing Board meetings. Don’t have to settle this today, if anyone is interested, please let me know. | We should address this during first meeting of December, so have a think about it. | . | Updates . | Rust WG (Scott): some new faces at WG meetings since the PR release. | OSL (Chris): OSL doing well, nothing major to report. Will do master-&gt;main rename soon. Kimball: has someone experimented? Michael: OCIO did this, posted writeup in TAC channel, it doesn’t update git clone commands so broke the CI, but overall the process was simple. Larry: can change outstanding PRs that refer to branches and redirects web requests, but it does not do the same for git commands, so scripts will break. Easy to fix, but requires human intervention. Kimball: should we set goal to have this done before End of Year? Chris: yes, that’s reasonable, will report back at next meeting. | MaterialX (Jonathan): interesting work is happening in other teams, SideFX has released Houdini 19 with deep MaterialX support, getting feedback on this. SideFX has implemented some code changes, expecting more as it moves into production. And working with Adobe on Adobe Standard Material, public version of the specification, need to reach out to Adobe to get access. Giving feedback on that, and how it could be implemented as a MaterialX graph. Larry: how does it differ from Autodesk? Jonathan: uses a different Fresnel conductor, uses a sheen model different from Imageworks sheen, have given feedback on it, need to make a strong case for a different sheen model, and a few other areas where they have done reparametrization, so different UI than what’s found in Autodesk standard shader, even though model is the same under the hood. | OpenVDB (Ken): talked about volumetric assets from Intel at last meeting, large library of VDB clouds of different resolutions and types, also need some level set examples. Will go out to respective studios and grab challenging assets such as water surfaces, both point clouds and ground truth water surfaces. Also post mortem on 9.0 release. Next item to work with Autodesk team, thinking of contributing adaptive data structure, looking exciting. Could be optional model alongside nanoVDB. Version 9.0 is nanoVDB, faster build times, OpenEXR 3 support (thank you Cary) . | OpenEXR (Cary): pretty quiet, pushed out a patch release last week, mostly fixes from Kimball to issues uncovered by Google OSS Fuzz running against new core library, seems to be going well. Experience with OSS Fuzz testing, at first got a flurry of dozens of issues all across the map, from legitimate issues to minor annoyances, then it went and stayed quiet until new core library was exposed to Fuzz tester, which created a bunch of new issues, but mostly legitimate / worth fixing, mostly around garbage / invalid input. Back to a trickle of issues. Had a couple of exchanges with package managers from Fedora in particular reporting various issues, good to have a more engaged relationship. One person reported test failures on an IBM mainframe architecture, provided an account to try it out. A bit of a science project, big endian machine. Also offered help in giving access to more obscure systems than what we have access in the normal CI builds. | OCIO (Michael): other than renaming the branch, also updated CII badge since it was out of date, thanks to Apple for contributing Metal support, merged into main branch, still additional work happening for testing. Kimball: USD hadn’t converted to OCIO 2, did internal libraries at WETA, is anyone else working on that? Michael: not that I’m aware of / have nor heard about it. Kimball: will contribute back the work then. | OTIO (Josh): released version 14, over a year since last major release. Went smoothly, a lot more of the process is automated now. So far no real complaints. Approved TSC charter (multi year process), should be able to deal with licensing / CLA re-signing / moving repo to ASWF organization. Did the branch rename, went pretty smoothly, a couple of pointers in the documentation had to be update, and updated CI which was restricted to running on specific branches. Will look at whether can add anything to the document shared by OCIO. Shannon: worth putting on the blog? Josh: yes, can write a short blurb and will send to you. Larry: is OpenVDB on the radar? Shannon, no, it is not, will contact Ken via email to get a blurb. | Assets (Eric): engagement with OpenVDB as to what would be useful as assets, Intel proposing volumetric assets. Other groups should add to the wishlist. Wave: didn’t have anyone at the meeting to assess complexity of Intel VDB assets, so hard to judge if they are “production quality”, would be good to get engagement from VDB. Also would animated VDBs be desirable? Issue of space. Ken: not only animated, but also velocity fields, which would help with testing motion blur in rendering. For complexity, those assets looked good, the largest one would be larger / more complex than the Moana cloud. Wave: would be great if they could supply a Houdini hip file so people could experiment. Came up with ALab context, people want to know if they are ingesting the asset correctly, being able to easily load the asset in Maya / Blender / Houdini would help. Eric: Houdini file would be the best way to compress it, especially for animation. Ken: does WETA has large volumetric assets that could be shareD? Kimball: probably, have a meeting next week with someone who deals with public facing “things”, can bring it up. | USD (Cory): good meeting last week, discussion around guidelines to structure USD assets, document from SideFX has been discussed last couple of sessions, could be interesting for Asset WG. Presentation on debugging in context of Visual Studio, will post video soon. WebViz and Camera WGs continue to meet. Michael Min: ramping back up the Camera WG, having discussions about new samples that can be generated from cameras. Jonathan: there’s a dedicated Slack for USD MaterialX, lots of good discussion going on there for USD / MaterialX. | D&amp;I (Carol): monthly meeting next week at noon, working on getting ambassadors for every project, have volunteers for half the projects so far. Also making progress on board succession planning. Kimball: what about in the context of the TAC chair discussion? Will be a member of the Governing Board, so can’t have 2 votes. Would be good to have some guidance there. | . | How could we bootstrap the project review process, improve their status? Any guidance from other LF foundations? . | Kimball: starting at the beginning, what was the first project that joined and start there. Cary: we give project updates at Open Source Days outwards to the community, how would this process be different from this? Kimball: we want to know where projects are at, but want to know if project is getting new people to show up at meetings (ambassador program), overall health of the project. Doesn’t necessarily have to be “public facing” (although of course we are open). If a project is struggling, could benefit from brainpower of TAC. Cary: can use CII badge as a checklist / discussion starting point, focussing on the Project Maintainer role. Kimball: could take a portion of a meeting, open up CII badge list, how could we help. Cary: when filling out CII, or more recently looking at the requirements for Silver / Gold status, can answer a lot of questions in the form, but who is reading this? Do answers really matter? From organizational point of view, would be worth talking through interpretation of what the requirements mean, how are we meeting them / struggling with them, share experience between projects. Kimball: our role as the foundation is to foster projects, not just “collect” them. How do we help ensure the health and growth of the projects. Ken: are there skillsets shared between projects that are stressing, OpenVBD switched to CMake a couple of years ago, have only one person who knows CMake, and even if he struggles, so anyone interested from other projects to help would be appreciated. Also struggle with the discussion around security, what does it mean to deliver secure software, we follow the guidelines, but no one in OpenVDB claims to be an expert on the topic. Would be good to invest in education / expertise. Wave: identify what the projects would like advice / guidance, and then get someone to present on the topic, for instance Apple has a lot of security experts, people in VFX facility may not have a lot of exposure to. Scott: if a team can write up how they solved a specific CMake problem (for instance), other teams may then know where to look. Eric: connections between projects are important, are we getting the cross pollination we need. Kimball: this sounds like a good set of bullet points to talk through this process. Ken: setting up CI is also something that every project struggles with. Eric: also related to how high are the barriers to entry to someone joining a new project, can you just download a build a project easily. Cary: if any project presented CI workflow, that could spark discussion. Could be a “show and tell”. Ken: leading to documentation. Wave: can work in both directions: projects asking for help on a topic, or demonstrating something they do well. Kimball: Andrew / John, do we know someone who can present on the topic of CMake? Andrew: don’t know anyone, but can find out. Don’t know Craig Scott, but can try to find out. (Kimball: he works for Kitware, wrote the Professional CMake book). Kimball: have read the Professional Cmake book. Larry: bought the ebook, it’s really good, anyone who touches CMake should read it. Kimball: we should be able to invite people like that to present. Cary: don’t use Cmake in day job, so only exposure is in maintaining OpenEXR. It’s one thing to get the project to build and install, but where we run into problems is where consumers of the project encounter something we didn’t anticipate, and our CI doesn’t exercise that, it doesn’t mimic what the downstream users experience. Could get someone who works on repackaging for distributions to present as well on their challenges. Ken: OpenVDB spends a lot of time on Windows support, since we don’t have any Windows developers, a problem for the build system and the code itself. Had an interesting bug that only showed up in Windows Debug CI builds for nanoVDB, turned out to be an actual bug, the Windows compiler in debug release mode performed extra checks. Scott: also on macOS, building on Linux is easy (especially with containers), but not sure that there are many in Rust WG on Windows / macOS. Kimball: had discussion about using MacPorts vs Homebrew, how do you service those variants. Wave: could be useful topic of Windows / macOS support. Would be good to share best practices on these platforms. | . | Python 3 Working Group Closure request (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmvZPwwhLu0KmCXbn4XgS4uzVuFCT2K21eQdQfnWYLE/edit?usp=sharing) . | TAC notes: repo vs wiki . | .

    "title": "Agenda",
    "content": ". | Richard Shaw, packaging (ASWF) projects for Fedora . | Fedora: supported by RedHat, but community driven, only one person paid by RedHat . | RedHat provides build servers and infrastructure . | 6 month release cycle target, currently at version 35 . | 2 versions supported, 1 year support cycle, slight overlap, for instance 35 was recently released, 33 will EOL in a month . | No clean correlation between RHEL and Fedora versions, but RHEL picks technologies from Fedora. RHEL 8 is roughly based on Fedora 24 . | Not one of the larger distributions such as Ubuntu, but everyone benefits from it, lots of people working on gcc, kernel, systemd contribute to Fedora. Before gcc 10 was released, rebuilt every package against gcc release candidate, find a lot of issues this way. | Tries to be leading but not leading edge. Jump on opportunity with building new versions of packages. | Not release a rolling release, in development release is called “RawHide”, will turn into Fedora 36 next. Most people don’t run RawHide on bare metal, mostly VMs for testing. | Packaging quality of life: must adhere to guidelines as packagers. | All artifacts must be provided from archive that was provided, plus patches and scm tree. No Internet access during build, so for instance no ffmpeg in source tree due to legal / US-based company. Everything must be in git. | Can’t pull in non-free/OSS code which would violate principles. Rpmfusion helps for binary blobs such as NVIDIA. | Everything built from source, even Java (which have become difficult to maintain). | . | Good to make things that are optional truly optional, sounds basic, but: . | Parts of build system that may try to download stuff, must be able to turn fof . | Bundled libraries: common in Linux world, Fedora used to have a hard stance against this, required committee approval. Now a bit easier, but if the library already exists in Fedora, encouraged to build against system version instead of bundled copy. But if the build system tries to check for existence of system library, may have to remove it during build. | Documentation generation and installation should be optional, especially if complex tooling is needed. Typically in /usr/shared/doc/package_name, so if the build installs documentation in the wrong place, will need ad hoc bash script to move it. | Would like to keep manual configuration to a minimum. | Large changes need to be well documented, this was an issue for OpenEXR 3 structural changes. Know your main consumers, such as Blender. OCIO 1-&gt;2 change caused issues since Blender went with 2 unilaterally, but some of its dependencies were still at 1. | . | Personally maintain around 150 packages on a volunteer basis. | Wasn’t the maintainer of older OpenEXR + IlmBase, but took over OpenEXR + Imath. | Porting guides are important, Larry wrote the one for OpenEXR, would have been stuck without it. Ended up doing the porting myself, and submitting to the list or as PRs to upstream projects for inclusion. May have spent 100s of hours to move everything hour. | Kimball: main issues were downstream users such as OpenVDB? . | Yes, OpenVDB not being compatible yet (part of Version 9). | Would be helpful if release notes mentioned timeline for adoption . | . | Ashley: how often do you find issues and need to create a patch for it? Sometimes those patches just exist in an RPM, is that preferred to upstream that patch to the project, do you wait for that patch to make it back to the project? . | Richard: all cases happen. Very few packages I maintain have zero patches. Larry / OIIO does a good job, but often you need a dirty hack to get things to build that can’t be upstream, but if the patch is clean, will try to upstream is. Some of these patches have been around for a long time. | . | Cary: point about “knowing your consumers” is a good one, which we struggle with. The ASWF as a forum brings together representatives of our community, a forum for projects to talk to each other. Adding package managers to the mix is a big step forward. How could OpenEXR 3 experience could benefit decisions in the future. We have no upcoming changes that are as disruptive, if we had to do it again, we would have reached out earlier. In ideal world, would have coordinated with OpenVDB to upgrade to new system to narrow the gap. | Kimball: we talk to Blender every SIGGRAPH, but they don’t come to TAC meetings (often). In our community, we need to lock software for a long time for multi-year project, but another project starting up may new version. So we need to support multiple versions at the same time. So projects have version number in the namespace. Maybe it’s time to change this behavior. | Richard: not necessarily a bad thing, soversions exist for this version to have multiple versions installed at the same time. Unless Fedora needs a compatibility package (for openssl for instance), typically have a single package. Only thing that creates grief is lack of ABI compatibility. OIIO is good about it, some upstreams aren’t that disciplined, won’t bump up soversion even when ABI changed, or change it needlessly. Tools such as ABI package diff, ABI compliance checker. Kimball: when redoing build files for OpenEXR, struggled to find a good reference for what is common / best practice. Richard: common practice isn’t necessarily best practice! Libtool has a strict policy, but hard to remember / understand how it works. But in general, if you make an API / ABI breaking change, increment soversion. Cary: yes, libtool is not simple, would like to move forward to something simpler, but haven’t found an alternative yet. Is there a better reference than libtool? Never fully understood the “age” it encodes in the soversion. Would love to retire that part of the process. Richard: would love to see an example of how this is all useful, from distro perspective, have to rebuild everything anyway. | JF: could look at VFX Platform to get set of interoperable ASWF projects. | Scott: what’s the main difference between being a Fedora package vs a Debian / Ubuntu packager, or are all the packaging processes similar? . | Richard: same but different, RPM vs DEB, serve same function purpose. In RPM world, single spec file controls everything. Typically don’t repackage, use the tar / archive provided (unless legal issues requiring code to be excluded) and check that into repo. Debian tends to repackage the archive. | Kimball: do you cross reference / share patches with other distros? Richard: sometime yes or no, may look at Debian packages for instance. Sometimes there is formal coordination, but often it’s just “who fixed it first” and use their work. | . | Larry: you maintain 150 packages, is there a thread that ties these together, or is it just historical? . | Richard: at beginning, just wanted to be a packaged, started with OpenCollada, then OCIO… Dependencies are a big part of it. Have personal interest in ham radio, so take care of those packages. People come in and out as package maintainers, so “Fedora Old timers” collect more and more packages to maintain. So an organic process, especially with an all volunteer team. | Not clear how many maintainers there are, hard to determine who is active, and what would be a cutoff for activity. But likely around 150 really active packagers. | . | Larry: there are lots of distributions out there, most of our projects have no idea how many distributions there are around. Would be interesting for us to try to upstream any patches, but we’re probably unaware of the vast majority of them. | Kimball: we’re redoing the CI infrastructure to make sure we can compile against 3 years of the VFX platform. Is there a good source of Docker containers for RawHIde so we can build an RPM package that’s good for Fedora? Larry: GHA runners a natively Ubuntu, but we run our CI inside CentOS 7 Docker containers, so we have the ability to test under different (containerized) distributions. Richard: build system runs some RHEL and some Fedora, use a program called mock that creates a chroot environment that allows building under different environments (except for the kernel). Andrew: mock will read the SPEC file, fill a cache with all the dependencies it finds, executes the build steps in a chroot environment with that cache, and will install those into that environment. Mock does it completely offline after it has filled its cache, no external dependency / download during your actual build. And your build will break if you haven’t declared a dependency. Kimball: but that doesn’t test people who depend on you. Andrew: yes, they would need to be building packages as well that are pull in your packages. Richard: there’s a way to test packages after they are built, creates a new chroot environment, installs your package, and runs any command you want. Have tested packages using X11 forwarding. | Cary: how does Security affect your work? Richard: upload sources to a lookaside card to generate SHA-1 sum, also a RPM signing key is required (using Sigil). No Internet access during build process. Kimball: we get emails about potential flaws / CVE reports, how does that affect Fedora? Richard: RedHat controls these, for instance a bunch of CVEs against OpenEXR were already fixed in Fedora. For serious issues, get help from RedHat, especially if it’s a product also in RHEL. Cary: process on how to respond to CVEs is educational process we went through, unclear what are our obligations as a widely distributed package. We now have a valid process / doing the right thing. Richard: was surprised recent OpenEXR issues were already fixed. | Larry: Fedora stays close to latest releases of all packages, in the more stable RHEL (and other distros), sometimes they are “annoyingly behind”, how do they determine what versions to use, anything we can do to help them stay closer to our releases? Do we need to communicate better? We want to lighten our support load of how many versions back we have to support. Richard: once RHEL releases, they stay mostly “stagnant”, they don’t do disruptive releases within a point release. On Fedora, when a maintainer has dropped out, sometimes a package will stagnate. There’s a process for dealing with unresponsive maintainers / orphaned packages. Also at some point some packages aren’t needed anymore. Can always submit a bugzilla issue to get someone’s attention. | Cary: about internet access during builds, OpenEXR uses the CMake fetch content mechanism to download Imath, that’s not a problem for you since you’ve already installed Imath as a separate project, right? Several people have mentioned not being fond of this Fetch Content feature. Richard: maybe should be a CMake flag to explicitly turn it on or off, so that if it can’t find it, it should just fail the build instead of falling back to trying to fetch (which would fail in turn). Cary: wanted to make things simpler for people who want to build OpenEXR and have it fetch its dependencies. | . | Carol: Google Summer of Code 2022 . | Rachel: talking with Carol about internships for next summer, something important in WG to bring new talent to ASWF. Wanted to plant seed in people’s mind, it may seem early, but we need to figure out something by end of January. Two questions that need to be answered: what sorts of projects would we have for projects for each of our ASWF projects, thinking about what would someone do, and not necessarily easy to answer, might be better done in individual TSCs. And whether we want to work with GSoC again, apply as an organization, end of January date tends to be the time we would need to put in our application. | Have the option of doing something we grow ourselves, last year we discussed different opinions on this topic. | Larry: 2 years ago we got 3 students, was considered successful. We didn’t apply last year, instead of task sizes spanning the whole summer, it didn’t seem like we had tasks that wouldn’t span the summer. Now they’ve changed the rules again, allowing for “full size” or “half size” tasks. | Rachel: this year, also opened up eligibility requirements, so non ‘traditional’ students may be eligible and can apply, could be interesting from D&amp;I perspective. Kimball: do they have to be enrolled in some kind of online training? Rachel: “all newcomers to open source 18 years or older, not just university students or recent grads”, so no specific requirements stated now, but may be specific requirements in the application form (working full time?). Larry: open possibility of people who are experienced developers, but not in this area / existing open source developers. This may open up wider range of tasks we could do. Kimball: do we want to do this, or do our own. Rachel: we are happy to contribute to GSoC application, or help spin up our own. | John: have lot of projects that will do both, GSoC and LFX mentorship, get wider reach / different set of constituents. Have to have larger audience of people who have interest. | Kimball: if we have 7 students, we won’t get 7 students… Larry: last time, new orgs doing it for the first time got maximum 3 students. We may get higher limit as a returning organization, but no guarantee we’ll get number of applications related to number of projects in ASWF. We don’t want to hard constraint that, we may get 3 great applicants for one project and non for another. Last time we looked at top students, had coordination between the projects, ended up with 3 that were spread across 3 projects. It’s up to us to decide how to use them across the organization. Kimball: seems like we should hedge our bets and try to do GSoC, but also try to do our own thing so we can open up to more people. John: when you do your own, a project might want 2-3 mentees, gives more flexibility on what they want to work on. Cary: GSoC requires code writing, as opposed to documentation, test case writing, asset gathering… . | Kimball: any thoughts on how to broaden scope? Rachel: we’ve talked about being able to bring in students who haven’t made it far enough to contribute code, but maybe code, assets. Would open up a wider range of people who could contribute. Wave: Asset WG talked about getting Intel cloud VDB assets, and get a student who would want to try these assets into various packages, classify them. Has to be a valid production level project, could be good for someone who is more on the artist side. An opportunity that’s different but related to writing code. Larry: we should do GSoC, it’s a no brainer. But we should strategize on how to evangelize the GSoC to targeted universities that have programs relevant to us, but also ones that we would not normally target. Try to encourage applications from people who would be good fits for our projects. Student on OpenEXR 2 years ago came from a university that had a Motion Picture Sciences program, might want to “pave the road” for some of these programs to encourage applicants, rather than relying on the somewhat random nature of GSoC applicants. Wave: could reach out to profs at some of the art schools or relevant programs to find students who might already know some of the DCC tools. | Rachel: started making a list of schools where we wanted to have focussed “advertising” of our programs, timeframe was too tight, but could go back to that. Wave: college students only have limited opportunities to “lift up their head and look around”, January might be a good time for that. Reach out to profs who could recommend students? . | Rachel: we should plan to apply for GSoC, and should come up with list of projects that either apply to GSoC. | Kimball: should we have a brainstorming session at next TAC? Rachel: yes. Shannon: will want to blog post about it as well. | . | Pipeline Working Group Proposal: https://github.com/pypeclub/aswf-wg-pipeline/blob/main/README.md . | Python 3 Working Group Closure request (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmvZPwwhLu0KmCXbn4XgS4uzVuFCT2K21eQdQfnWYLE/edit?usp=sharing) . | .

    "content": ". | Google Summer of Code participation discussion (cont) . | Rachel: would make sense to apply to GSoC, also pursue a ASWF specific program for additional internships that don’t fit in GSoC requirements / other projects we want to get done. | Anyone responsible for a project, in your TSC meetings, discuss possible projects would be useful. Interested not only on pure coding, but also documentation / other projects, will want to have a good list of those early next year. | What does it look like to have our own program, what would we want out of this, 3 months, everyone at the same time? . | . | Scott: for projects that have already had discussions, who to talk to to send proposals? Rachel: Carol and I will take care of applications to GSoC, as well as spearhead process of pulling together our own program, possibly leverage LF infrastructure. Please send to Carol and Rachel . | Anything not coding would have to be under our own, since that doesn’t fit under GSoC . | Board has not been approached yet for funds, that had been approved last year, but we didn’t do it last year, also had strong focus on summer learning program. So will be important to put together a proposal for funds approved by the board. | Larry: for GSoC, have we decided who will take responsibility for filling application? Rachel: offered for Carol and Rachel. Larry: agree with that. Can provide records of what was submitted the last time we did this if that’s useful / not have to start from scratch. Rachel: that would be great. Larry: all projects must get project ideas well ahead of time so it can coalesced into a single page. Eric; should we declare a deadline? Rachel: yes, GSoC application is due end of January, so January 15th would be a good deadline for proposals. | Rachel: anything we can levery from other LF-backed foundations? Best way to move forward is once we have list of projects, we can identify the ones that don’t fit in GSoC, and can point to overall size of internship program. | Eric: we have a TAC meeting on Jan 12th, should we make deadline the 11th? Rachel: yes, that sounds like a good idea. | . | Open Source Forum 2022 . | Shannon: rough agenda we’re thinking about. Foundation will send a “save the date” later this month, planning March 10th at Academy Museum, board, tac, 2-4 spots per member company, will also have remote attendance (week of VES Awards). | 11-12 ASWF Governing Board Meeting . | 13:00-13:15 State of the Union . | 13:15-15:15 TAC project updates . | 15:15- … Going Forward . | Contingency plan in case it can’t happen in person? Shannon: LF will require proof of vaccination + masks at all times . | . | TAC chair . | Kimball will be on the Governing Board next year, is there someone interested in chairing the TAC, we should have a rotation, but there’s also benefit to continuity. We don’t have term limits? John: no official term limits, but we revisit once a year. We can keep a period open until next meeting, can send “notice of interest” / nomination to John. Role can be demanding, one thing could consider could be a “co chair”, one person who takes on the meetings, the other interfacing with the board. Kimball: yes, that could be an option. So let’s say that if someone wants to pitch their hat (or someone else’s hat) in the ring… Larry: I’d like to nominate Kimball! Rachel: it has been very helpful to have Carol &amp; I to chair the D&amp;I group at the same time, so a co-chair setup for the TAC could definitely be helpful. Kimball: please send names to John, and we can discuss next time. | . | Project Updates . | Asset WG: Eric. Proposal from AWS for a fully rigged Maya character assets. Not USD at this time. Have a video explaining what the controls do in the rig, also talked about documentation. Enthusiastically voted to accept into WiP section of the repo, can help to develop to the point it can be public. Discussion continues with LF for a website, will use Garett with a friendly front end. Relative merits of just having large tarballs (not have to deal with git), vs pointers to individual files, but some of these are quite large, so will need git-lfs. Current plan is to have in git/git-lfs form, will make it easier to access / propose modifications. If these assets turn out to be quite large, need to keep an eye on download costs, make sure it’s not being done by robots. | OpenCue: Brian. Not many updates, missed a few planned TSC meetings due to a mix a factors (holidays / vacations / illness), have a TSC planned next week. Most priorities are the same as before: CY2022 full support including Python 3.9, new planned user submission system, nothing concrete for now. | OpenEXR Cary: steady trickle of issues / minor bugs / doc fixes. Likely to stay quiet through the end of the year. Accumulating list of initiatives that will be spun up in the new year, for instance fixing up so versioning / namespace practices. Kimball: have official production renders using OpenEXR 3.1, changes made for the core stuff is making 30% performance improvement to shading. | OSL Chris: missed two last TSCs due to schedule issues, no new updates. | MaterialX Jonathan: had good presentations from SideFX and Solid Angle showing latest integrations into Solaris and Arnold. Both projects look very promising and teams are very engaged with USD and MaterialX. Have had new proposals from SideFX for nodes such as Worley noise, had been specified but not implemented, looks promising. Also contributing ramp nodes that were missing, looking to integrate in 1.3.9. Upgraded version of PyBind to support Python 3.9 in GHA test suite. Discussions about refining the scope of MaterialX, removing overlap with USD so you can fully support MaterialX with the material functionality, will try to integrate in 1.3.9 as well, and discuss at next USD / MaterialX WG. SideFX put together chess board asset, pure USD / MaterialX which they use in Karma tutorial videos, made freely available. Could be a contribution to Asset WG, a pure USD / MaterialX production quality asset, with subsurface scattering. Started discussion to see if they would be interested in contributing asset. Would be good to have that part of test suites. SideFX Karm Rendering Course Announcement . | OCIO / Michael. Not a ton new, put a date on next round of releases on Dec 14, updates that have been in the works. Second PR from Apple with Metal test suite. ACES Config part: almost done with CG config, a fully self contained ACES config based around CG work, should be very useful. | OpenTimelineIO update (Josh pasting this in) (Nick) . | Autodesk’s latest release of RV includes support for OTIO: https://community.shotgridsoftware.com/t/rv-2022-0-0-release-is-available/13949 . | Foundry is showing interest in OTIO support &amp; attending upcoming TSC meetings . | Lots of work done on Python wheels, automatically deployed and tested for all platforms and supported Python variants. Happy to share how to automate Python wheels.. | . | USD WG (Nick). USD Web getting close to their approach, should be able to start rolling out patches to compile USD to WASM. USD MaterialX group hasn’t started yet. USD Camera: created GitHub repo to gather ideas / sets of attributes that have been in Slack channels until now. Lots of new data being gathered by Michael Min, new Slack channel #wg-usdcamera. Larry: USD currently doesn’t built against OpenEXR 3 aka VFX Platform 2022, would be good if we could figure out what’s happening and put them in touch with OpenEXR team. Nick: talking specifically about building USD with imaging and getting OpenEXR vs OIIO? Larry: no, it’s more about internal usage of Imath, so just needs touch up with #include paths. | Rust Scott: looking at priorities for January . | CI (JF) Docker images updated to OpenVDB 9, feature complete for VFX Platform 2022 . | OpenVDB: Ken: releasing 8.2 with TBB 2021 and OpenEXR 3, so features which don’t change the ABI. Working a project that’s pitched to TSC, new command line to expose all the tool functionality in a single command line tool. Read a mesh file, convert it, level set processing, ray tracing… Duplicate a lot of the workflow you can find in Houdini, but from the command line. Will share repo next week and TSC will discuss on directions. May integrate with Ax, working on that at NVIDIA. | Raw2aces: Kimball: had a couple of TSC meetings, going through legal documents, getting assignments to ASWF sorted out. No specific code transfers yet. | . | Python 3 Working Group Request for Closure . | Ashley: last time we spoke about it, talked about writing up a report, and are we OK to close it. WG has a target and should either be extended or closed down. | Document has been written: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmvZPwwhLu0KmCXbn4XgS4uzVuFCT2K21eQdQfnWYLE/edit?usp=sharing) . | Goals of the WG were to share and develop best practices between studios and DCC vendors, and coordinate some transition efforts between studios and DCC vendors, and share common experiences to reduce duplication of effort. | Achieved most of those through deliverables: a resources page that links to external resources to help teach how to move to Python 3. Also a basic transition guide as a starting template for bigger studios to write their own guides to have a more VFX-centric guide. | SideFX made a page listing some of the things they ran across when transitioning their C API from Python 2 to Python 3 . | A deliverable we didn’t manage to produce is a list of risk factors for the VFX industry. Risk factors that led to slow transition were studios / DCC vendors in a deadlock, python 2 support still existing means studios aren’t incentivized to transition and vice versa. Has eased over time. Tried to get statements from vendors as to when dropping Python 2 support, Autodesk provided such a statement. Was looking for a statement from The Foundry but haven’t gotten one yet. Other risk factor is still not all third party software is Python 3 compliant, some packages still not Python 3 compatible. | WG may not have as much change as it would have hoped to. Also status updates from studios showed that transition work hasn’t been priorititized, at time of last meeting, WDAS and DNEG were the large studios that were making sustained efforts. | Larry: can you share the Autodesk position? Ashley: have had it for a while. Support for Python 2 in version of 3DS Max after 2021, for Maya and MB, same, so Python 2 gets dropped in what comes after Maya 2022. Available in the WG repo on GitHub. | Kimball: do you see things the WG should continue working on? Ashley: if the pace of the transitions picks up within the studios (hopefully Maya dropping Python 2 support), then that might be worth picking up the WG again. In the DNEG transitions, haven’t come across problems that are specific to VFX, resources that exist out there cover 98% of what was needed, apart from what is internal to the studio. | Kimball: WETA has a number of workflows that are Python 3 only, including Houdini and Maya. Standard tools work, finding about ascii / utf-8 issues. Took snapshot of work from WG to access internally. Thank you for the great work! . | Gordon: WG started with VFX Platform starting Python 3 transition, we didn’t have support in packages we depend on. Goal was to have sure to have a plan for transition. What do we think success looks like / do we think all the barriers are down and studios have all the tools they need for the transition? Or are there other definitions for success. Ashley: ideally studios need to be in a place where they can “do the right thing” and start using Python 3 and get rid of Python 2 everywhere, but that’s not necessarily the TAC’s goal. Not clear how to quantify that. Gordon: any other activities that could enable this transition, or got to the end of identified work. Ashley: yes, got to the end of the identified work, at this point studios need to prioritize it. Larry: it wasn’t until we had the DCCs in house to allocate time for the work, with plans to use them before priorities could be adjusted. Kimball: starting to encounter a “forcing function” such as third party open source packages that are only Python 3. Don’t know of additional efforts that would be needed to encourage people to convert. Ashley: breaking point will be when Python 3.10 makes into VFX Platform since it removes so much Python 2 compatibility, and it will be impossible to maintain 2.7 and 3.10 compatibility (3.9 still has some compatibility). | Kimball: we can celebrate a great job and close off the WG. We can always reopen the process later if needed. Gordon: it’s easier to start WGs than to wrap them up, so it’s good to agree that we’ve gotten to an end-point achievement. | . | Larry: have we decided the next meeting is happening, since that’s the time of the year when people are less available (Dec 15th). John: will want to keep the 15th, there’s a project proposal likely to come in. But the 29th might be a skip. | Pipeline working group proposal from 17-Nov: Invite Milan to present at next TAC meeting . | . ",

    "content": ". | Google Summer of Code deadline . | Larry: reminder of deadline for different projects groups to get their lists of projects together | . | New marketing manager for LF, Alix Robinson . | Plan to attend some of the calls to get an idea of what the foundations are up to . | Based on West Coast, will be at Open Source Forum . | . | Assets (Eric) . | Talking to ASC about StEM 2 project . | It’s a large project, around 20TB, if that’s downloaded 30 times, could end up rakeing up large bandwidth costs (over $50K, hosting server egress fees, above total budget) . | Wanted to add a clause to the license: if someone redistributes asset in a different form, does it match the artistic intent of the director / DP (recompression, extreme color correction). | “Redistributions of these digital assets or any part of them must include ^​a description of how the redistributed version differs from the original,^ the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the disclaimer below.” . | Will talk to LF legal about this. | . | Allan Johns: Rez proposal as ASWF project . | Started at MPC London, one of the major topics being discussed was package management, packet version context, system in place at the time was somewhat crude, a hierarchy of shell scripts. Moved back to Australia, started working on solving the version problem, first version was called drd-config. | Let’s have a repository of version definitions defining the packages and their requirements, and as solver algorithm that satisfies user requests. From this create the config runtime. | Early version was a Python solver with bash around it. | Drd-config / Rez was open sourced when DRD Studios closed. | Worked for Method / moved to LA, worked on second generation of Rez, complete rewrite and became a Python library. | Been developed on and off since then, over the last year there’s been consistent progress. | Kimball: what do you see as major functionality left to implement? Allan: Rez is not a build system, but facilitates running a build system. It has a “build” command to create an appropriate runtime to build a package, detecting CMake files, package.py tells which build command to use. But does not do the build itself, it is not designed to facilitate the build chain. To get there, major piece of work to be done is to introduce concept of “features”, having dependencies of the package that describe a characteristic of the package, not another package. For instance the build type (debug vs release), this “features” concept is require to enable building an entire chain of packages, and thus have the “safe” installation of packages. | Brent: ASWS is currently using Docker images, has good features and benefits, are there plans to have “Rez in a Docker environment” or “Rez playing nicely with Docker”? Allan: at Method, beginning to use Rez-based software in containers, “Rez Bundle” feature will take a Rez context (full definition of a resolved runtime) and bundle it, copy all of the required packages into a relocatable directory, on Linux will do all the required ELF patching (fix up any dependencies on rpath) and copy the bundle directory into your container. Seems to work fine. Method doesn’t have an internal fork of Rez, always working on the open source version, so this functionality is available in the publicly available version. | Brent: would there be desire to distribute the VFX Reference Platform as Rez Libraries? Allan: interesting question, right now we don’t have a public repository of Rez packages, so that could be useful. There are various forms of this around from various studios, but no formal public repo. But will be more useful once Rez is able to act as a full packager. An obvious goal would be to have a repository that satisfies the Reference Platform. Brent: publishing the canonical package.py for OpenEXR / Rez for VFX Platform 2022 would be useful. Allan: if we’re going to have a public repository of packages, have to agree on what the dependencies look like. JF: starting to produce Conan packages. Allan: Rez is definitely specific to industry, so multiple package formats makes sense. | No CLAs or code of conduct yet, but should be straightforward to put in place. | Rez is GitHub based . | Have full list of dependencies and licenses, in process of switching licenses and verifying . | Dependencies are embedded in the project itself, “chicken and egg” problem. Want to use the Rez API as a Rez package, so need to be able to install the Rez API as a Rez package. But if it pulls dependencies from GitHub, need a bridge (RezKit) to turn these dependencies into Rez packages. But it can be a barrier to entry to install Rez as a Rez package. So that’s why packages are embedded in Rez currently. | Role of the project: Allan has been sole maintainer, managing releases and PRs, although there are a lot of external contributions. Kimball: do you know how many studios are using Rez? Allan: I wish, no way to know for sure. Looking at GitHub stats, should give a rough idea. 234 forks currently. Seems like a lot of smaller studios are using it, maybe 200, and a few larger studios. Have had lists in the past, but not up to date anymore. | There’s a Slack channel and a Google forum, but typically people create GitHub issues directly. Issue tracking in GitHub. | CII: summarized points that will need to be addressed. Have integrated SonarCloud, which was reasonably straightforward for static analysis. | Rez has a pretty good suite of GitHub Actions workflows. | Lack of expertise on designing secure software. Kimball: all projects have been struggling with that. Allan: package definitions have to be Python source packages, so runtime code evaluation is a vulnerability. | Website is GitHub hosted, and a reasonably extensive Wiki (on GitHub). | Release methodology and cadence: release is simple / linear, will do a new semantic versioned release based on content. No formalized process to mark major releases. Cadence is pretty good, over last year about one release per week on average. | Kimball: what do you see as a benefit to having Rez becoming an ASWF project? Allan: primary goal is to facilitate confidence in the project to have more people involved from a governance point of view. Should not remain the sole “benevolent dictator”, wanted to write Rez in the first place to solve the packaging problem in VFX, would like to have more people involved to help solve this problem. | Kimball: have you talked to people about joining TSC? Allan: will do this once project is accepted. | Stephen Mackenzie (work with Allen): from someone who works at a studio using Rez, and thinks about other studios that use Rez. When interacting with Rez as a project, Allan is the one who understands the project inside out, when considering new features or external contributions. ASWF could not only bring legitimacy to the project, but ability to put it in front of other developers in the industry, build a community of people who can learn how the project works, and “externalize” the knowledge that is only held by Allan right now. | Allan: I can be the bottleneck, especially with complex PRs. Sometimes can take quite a while to look at a complex PR, can sometimes take weeks / months, consider the implications. The project is big enough that I become a significant bottleneck. | Michael Min: are there considerations about licensing issues and conflicts once packages are created. Also MPC packages was a bit of a tangled web, and difficult to archive and bring back later, have you considered package archiving and retrieval. Allan: in process of Rez-ifying, haven’t looked at licensing issues since for now it’s been internal, so no redistribution yet. What if you have an external repository? Rez doesn’t have a facility for hosting artifacts, would just be the Rez package definitions. For archival, now have more support for package archival, it’s not complex enough to take into considerations of the requirements of the package itself, for now mostly moving into a repository marked as archival repository. Primary motivation is that over time you end up with more and more Rez packages in your repository, which affects your resolve time, so archival can be an optimization step. There’s a feature to integrate with RabbitMQ, send data to Elastic so we know when and where packages are used, to identify packages that haven’t been used in a while. | Larry: there is another project with similar goals being worked on by Imageworks/ILM/Weta/Disney, doesn’t seem like there’s a mutually exclusive issue with having two similar efforts. These projects can influence each other, move in parallel directions. Not bringing this up as a point against Rez, but would be good to understand what the relationship would be, considering that several of the larger ASWF member companies are involved in the other project. Don’t want to set up a situation where we accept Rez and some of the companies go in another direction. | Allan: watched the talk on spk, there were some misunderstandings about Rez in that talk, would have been good to reach out. One thing that came up was the fact that the build environment was based on package runtime requirements, but could be fixed fairly easily. More communication would have been good. Is it dependent on overlayfs? Larry: yes, big difference, Rez is based more on central storage, whereas spk wants to make packages are mountable layers, pros and cons to both approaches. Don’t want to turn this into “Rez vs Spk”, solve slightly different problems. But could they influence / cross-pollinate each other. There’s no ASWF rule that we should have only one solution to a specific problem, and spk is still somewhat far away. Allan: talking about different approaches, overlayfs vs centralized artifacts, I think it would be better to separate the concept of how to create the runtime environment. With Rez can end with very long PYTHONPATH, can create metadata load on shared storage. Could be better to create symlink-based runtime environments, so better to abstract away / more modular, could have different ways to create a runtime environment separate from the original solver. It’s where I see Rez going, have to solve the problem of overly long PYTHONPATH . | Larry: having both projects coexisting not a problem. For instance when accepting OpenCue, we knew that many of the major ASWF companies already had their own solutions, it was still felt there was value to OpenCue. | Gordon: is there a comparison of “Rez vs spk”? Would be good to understand those differences. Allan / Larry: don’t know that there’s a good one, given current form of both projects. Gordon: how we handle multiplicity is a good question, there’s a “support cost” to having multiple solutions. | Allan: if spk gains enough ground and is shown to be easy enough to be used by smaller studios, that would be good as well. Main goal is to solve the VFX packaging problem. Gordon: maybe there two very different packaging problems / philosophies and we should support both. | Kimball: maybe there’s room for a common resolver? . | Bill: is there a rough timeline for spk to become open source? Larry: thought we would be there by now, have a list of issues to be resolved before can have a public 1.0, repository is private for now, add users who show interest, but it’s not a “secret”, but it’s not ready / out of box experience isn’t there yet. Still figuring stuff out, have shrinking number of critical issues before we can let anyone try it out. Don’t want to create bad initial impressions. Don’t have a specific timelines, but feel like we’re closing in on it. Happy to invite anyone to join meetings / repositories. No secret / NDA required. | Bill: Dreamworks uses Rez routinely / across the board, so we would like to ass Rez join ASWF. Larry: I’m also supportive of Rez being admitted. | Allan: not having compatibility in spk with existing system such as Rez could be a lost opportunity? Larry: not sure what you mean by compatibility? Allan: yes, spk being able to consume Rez package definitions? Larry: not sure how close that is to be feasible. Could be that the two share package specs / build recipes, and difference would be different backends / solvers, otherwise they can be quite different, but can import package spec from the other system. | Kimball: we’re unfortunately out of time, great discussion, thank you Allan for presenting. We can continue discussion over email / Slack, we will have a vote over email and can move forward. | . | Pipeline working group proposal from 17-Nov: Invite Milan to present at next TAC meeting . | .

    "content": ". | Name of the project (existing or proposed): Rez | Requested project maturity level (select one): Adopted or Incubation Incubation | Project description (please describe the purpose and function of the project, its origin and its significance to the ecosystem): Rez is a cross-platform package manager. Using Rez you can create runtimes configured for a given set of packages. However, unlike many other package managers, packages are not installed into these runtimes. Instead, all package artifacts are installed into a central repository, and runtimes reference these existing artifacts. As a consequence, runtimes have a minimal footprint can be constructed quickly, often within a few seconds. The first version of rez was implemented at Dr.D studios in Sydney, and was called drd-config (it was initially close-sourced, but was made open source around the same time the company was shelved). The original motivation for the project came from having worked at MPC London previously, where we’d started running up against significant issues related to package management, that at the time we did not have a suitable solution for. Rez is used widely in the VFX industry as its ability to configure runtimes with minimal overhead makes it useful for managing a large number of different configurations at once (corresponding to the large number of active shows and tools common within many studios in our industry). | Please explain how this project is aligned with the mission of ASWF? The intent of rez from the beginning was to provide a common platform for package management in the VFX industry, which I think quite closely aligns with the ASWF’s mission to “provide a common build [and test] infrastructure” in VFX. Rez aims to solve a problem common to virtually every studio, and unsurprisingly we do see a number of similar, closed-source solutions in place in various studios. I believe that by collaborating on a common project instead, we can minimise redundant efforts at solving this problem; help share knowledge of one system across studios so that expertise is more easily accessible; help share software interstudio if and when that’s required; and overall minimise the internal resources a given studio needs to put towards managing their software. | What is the project’s license for code contributions and methodology for code contributions. ASWF maintains recommendations for contribution and licensing for hosted projects. | License is (as of very recently) Apache 2.0. | LICENSE file is included in root of project | Copyright and license header is included in every source file | CONTRIBUTING.md present | DCO signoffs are not present | CLA is not in use | No code of conduct provided | . | What tool or platform is utilized for source control (GitHub, etc.) and what is the location (e.g. URL)? Rez GitHub Repo . | What are the external dependencies of the project, and what are the licenses of those dependencies? See Rez project README.md . | What roles does the project have (e.g. maintainers, committers?) Who are the current core committers of the project, or which can a list of committers be found? I would have to describe myself as the sole maintainer (I’m the only one who merges to master and manages releases), however there are significant contributions from other members. Committers . | What mailing lists are currently used by the project? . | Slack (rez-talk) | Mailing list | . | What tool or platform is leveraged by the project for issue tracking? GitHub. | Does the project have a Core Infrastructure Initiative security best practices badge? Do you foresee any challenges obtaining one? (See: CII Best Practices: No it does not have the badge. I don’t see challenges in obtaining one, as it seems that most requirements are already met. However points that may need to be addressed are summarized below (taken from CII Criteria: . | The project website MUST provide information on how to: obtain, provide feedback (as bug reports or enhancements), and contribute to the software. (minor updates to CONTRIBUTING.md required) | The project MUST provide reference documentation that describes the external interface […] (Sphinx docgen is provided, however public API is not well defined, this will need some work) | To enable collaborative review, the project’s source repository MUST include interim versions for review between releases (Currently we do not have release candidates, only standard releases) | The project MUST publish the process for reporting vulnerabilities on the project site (honestly I’m not clear on what vulnerabilities mean in the context of rez presently) | It is SUGGESTED that the test suite cover most (or ideally all) the code branches, input fields, and functionality (testing is good in general but more could be done to establish actual coverage) | The project MUST have at least one primary developer who knows how to design secure software (I don’t know what this means in practice tbh) | At least one of the project’s primary developers MUST know of common kinds of errors that lead to vulnerabilities in this kind of software, as well as at least one method to counter or mitigate each of them (see above) | At least one static code analysis tool (beyond compiler warnings and “safe” language modes) MUST be applied to any proposed major production release of the software [..] (we do not currently have any form of static analysis in place) | It is SUGGESTED that at least one dynamic analysis tool be applied […] (what is dynamic analysis and how is that different to a test suite?) | . | What is the project’s website? Is there a wiki? Rez Wiki . | What social media accounts are used by the project? None. | What is the project’s release methodology and cadence? Release methodology is basic and should be updated. Currently we simply perform a linear set of semver releases (patch or minor - major version changes are extremely uncommon). We do not have formal releases where some amount of production testing has been quantifiably done beforehand. Cadence: 66 releases over the past year, so just over one release a week on average. All releases are summarized here: Rez ChangeLog . | Are any trademarks, registered or unregistered, leveraged by the project? Have any trademark registrations been filed by the project or any third party anywhere in the world? No. | . ",

    "title": "Agenda",
    "content": ". | Rez discussion after proposal last meeting . | Should have a group discussion and accept Rez into ASWF . | How should we deal with “competing” projects (spk / Larry) . | Scott: do we remember roughly whether Rez stated that if ASWF accepted Rez, what resources could ASWF provide to Rez that would benefit it? . | Kimball: primary ask was to grow, and no longer be a single developer project. Legal infrastructure would make it easier for other facilities to contribute back. | Scott: any reasons not to? Kimball: only reason was whether we will have “competing” projects? Larry: not sure what TAC wants to do about competing projects, some of the member companies seem committed to “other project”. Sean McDuffee: does this qualify as a “foundational” project? Kimball: OpenCue, OSL are more “experimental”. Larry: most projects already have wide use in facilities. JF: would be accepted to “incubation status”. Kimball: even if Rez is not used at facilities looking at other approaches, could still be used at smaller facilities / general members. Larry: don’t have a reason not to accept it. Michael: Bill mentioned it was heavily use at Dreamworks. Nick: burden on TAC is slight, we just have to listen to short updates. Cary: it is until it isn’t, we haven’t had to deal with a project “in crisis” yet, cautionary question to ask is “if a project goes south, would we be in a position to help it / muster support for it”. Thinking about what obligations we take on in the future. Not Rez-specific, more generally. Kimball: this is true for all our projects, but this is a smaller, single developer project for now. Eric: part of the goal of ASWF is to help support projects from risks of a single maintainer moving on. Wave: the point of incubation is to bring in a project to ASWF incubation, becomes a focus for people who can’t contribute can now contribute now that it is within the ASWF fold. | Larry: have we gotten to the point that there are projects you can’t contribute to until part of ASWF? Wave: some companies only allow contribution to specific open source projects where the legal department has vetted the license. Larry: project controlled by a single person can still use same licenses and CLA. Wave: different companies have different levels of friction for contribution to open source projects. Larry: it would be an accomplishment if we did this. Cary: some larger companies frown on contribution to single person projects, whereas contribution to ASWF projects is easier. Kimball: Rez should be a project, not a WG. | Patrick: if you accept a project in ASWF, does it become the reference project / promote that project? Kimball: an interesting point. We are implicitly endorsing a project if we accept it, our charter is to promote projects that are specific to the M&amp;E / Film industry, Rez is used in a number of facilities. Sean: incubation phase is a way to have more people look at the project. Chris: would a WG be a better solution? Kimball: it’s really a project, not a WG. Chris: a WG would be around the topic of package management? Could be a good forum to survey the landscape. Allan mentioned the thought of running a survey. Do we see it realistic to have both projects accepted? Kimball: can see a different scale to them. Building your own large scale software deployment, vs just reusing binaries? Chris: would each project need to maintain two sets of packages? Kimball: anyone maintaining RPM SPEC or .deb configs? Doesn’t seem so. | Larry: Rez / Spk config scripts don’t live in the project, they live one level above that since they specify which version and which commits to pull. Individual projects may not be maintaining those. Sam: there is an advantage to having common package configuration recipes. Could encourage a common recipe format. Gordon: we need to articular the differences if we are going to bring ion a diversity of solutions. Is there a formal comparison? Larry: there’s already a CI WG, and was part of the genesis of the spk collaborative project. Lots of people already using Rez, we should want to support that. Cary: our purpose isn’t to endorse or promote projects, but to support them. Sean McDuffee: does inclusion in ASWF “guarantee” support? Larry: it’s not “magic”, all projectgs are in the same boat, ASWF gives some visiblity, but TAC isn’t assigning people to work on project, people work on projects because they are interested in them. Cary: by admitting a project, we offer a certain level of support. If a project dies because it becomes outdated, that’s fine, everything as a life cycle, but it shouldn’t die because of lack of support. Allen: there are a finite amount of resources, so if there are two competing projects, that could dilute resources. Cary: competition between projects will happen, is it better if it happens within the organization? . | Kimball: motion to vote. Wave: seconds. Thumbs up, no opposes, two abstain (Gordon, Chris, in principle given the interesting new issues). | Motion approved, Rez approved as an incubation level ASWF project. | Larry: there has been discussion in CI group to ammend our mission statement, less about CI itself, but more the group of people who talks about builds, deployments, testing… So a lot of the discussion has drifted. If you are interested on how to build packages, that’s the place to go. JF: will present updated mission statement. | . | Finally approve the review &amp; approval WG . | Is there someone who can walk us through proposal? Yes, Erik Strauss. | Have been in shadows for a bit, objectives: . | Standardization of media and metadata: standards, validation of encoding strategies for the industry to standardize on . | Endeavour to stand up a project for an open source platform for review (SPI / Dneg), an actual code project on which anyone can build a review platform . | . | Kimball / John: we need to do the official WG vote. Do we have quorum . | Wave motions, a second. | Thumbs ups, no opposes or abstains, motion carries. Welcome to the Review &amp; Approval WG! . | Shannon: we can do a blog post? Erik: yes, will help with that. | . | GSoC / internship proposals [Carol] . | GSoC / possibility of our own program . | GSoC deadline coming up . | Got responses from several projects, sent note to TAC slack channel, answering questions about how detailed listings need to be . | GSoC has good documentation . | Submit application early Feb, want to get sense of how interested we are, what kind of resources we want to put in. Without enthusiasm, these programs will not succeed. So looking for expressions of interest, can work with you to turn this into GSoC application. Also looking for mentors, which is what Google is looking for. | Timelines are more flexible this year the duration of GSoC projects. | Deadline is technically today, if projects get proposals by end of week, should be OK. | Kimball: took 3 weeks of “no computer time”, so will take advantage of this end of week delay. OpenEXR has great experience with last GSoC and are enthusiastic to do this again. Was a rewarding experience. Cary: talked in recent meeting, wrote up proposal. | Sample from Rust WG: https://github.com/vfx-rs/organization/pull/11/files . | Sample from OpenEXR: https://wiki.aswf.io/display/OEXR/OpenEXR+Project+Ideas . | Eric: Asset group has a possible proposal? Wave: were wondering if there’s a specific alignment on GSoC, or a broader notion of “non-code projects” (which can’t be part of GSoC). Hard deadline is GsOC? Carol: it is both, we are doing at doing both. But hard deadline is for GsOC. Wave: have ideas about sample data, not necessarily writing code. Carol: working with LF, hoping to build off its system for internships. We need to come up with numbers to bring to the board. Wave: we will try to have a proposal by end of week. | . | LF Open Source Forums (John) . | March 10th, from past years this is a half day events focussed towards a more executive crowd, looking to put together schedule / program, asking projects if they have an outline of any major announcements that could line up around that time, if that can be shared (events, milestones), trying to put a program together and how this work can be shared. Please share with John or Alex in LF Marketing. Kimball: will talk offline, have some ideas on the topic. | . | Project funding [Michael] . | Several questions in USD and camera WG about getting resources. We’ve touched on the topic in a few TAC meetings, but not a clear process. So what would be the process? Kimball: it depends on what we are asking for: time bounded / concrete ask, we can approve that and ask the governing board. But a open ended / ongoing cost like Slack, that needs a bit more involved presentation to TAC. Hiring a developer would be more difficult since we don’t have a reporting structure. Michael: at last meeting, many members have company developers committed to ASWF projects, but some do not. But if it’s a simple manner of drawing up a proposal and submitting it, can do that. Kimball: yes, if we agree, we can move it on to Governing Board. | David: every premiere member has committed an engineer equivalent to work on ASWF projects, nothing prevents members from committing more resources, but we rely on open source community to work on our projects. | Kimball: hiring cameras for a day shoot could be a specific expenditure. | . | ASC StEM and Asset Project (Eric) . | Legal council from Disney suggested a rewording of what ASC wanted to avoid modified redistribution. | ASC was fine with suggested. They would like to release assets next week to hit a conference deadline. Asset Project will request an OK, version 1.1 of the license, or optional (prefer as a 1.1). | Wave : using original license + disclaimer, but then they can’t claim to fall under our license / wouldn’t have our license. | Sean McDuffee: has this gone to Governing Board yet? Eric: no, John Mertic asking for feedback from LF legal. And yes, it’s short notice / timing is awkward. But would be great to have ASC footage as part of ASWF asset repo. | . | Pipeline working group proposal from 17-Nov: Invite Milan to present at next TAC meeting . | . ",

Didn’t detail the agenda on purpose since would like the TAC to think about what’s the best presentation from the TAC’s perspective in an hour long format, which is a snapshot of where we are and where we are going. Demonstrate the value that’s been created. | Eric: should projects say a sentence or two of how they’ve been affected by ASWF projects / how having all the projects together has helped projects in general. David: yes, that sounds good, should take time in next few TAC meetings to figure out how we want to structure this. We’re not just talking to ourselves, we’re also talking to people who don’t know much about ASWF. | Goals of Open Source Forum 2022 . | Assemble our “Friends and Family” | Prospective new member companies | Share our results and plans | Get their feedback | Grow our platform | Grow our mindshare | Not a “fundraiser” per say, but want prospective companies to come out of the meeting with a strong idea why they should join | . | List of 40 non-member companies / organizations that we would like to have in our foundation, there’s a spreadsheet “Open Source Forum 2022 invite list”. If you know someone in those companies who could be a good person to invite, please contribute (also want to target companies that would have / could get approved budget to join). Spreadsheet is protected, but can request access, or send suggestions directly to David. | Kimball: when should we finalize the TAC presentation, in 2 meetings / 1 month? David: “as soon as possible”, can use some of the time now, should have a draft at end of next TAC meeting (2 weeks from now). Kimball: will be good to give people a moment to think about what could be a cohesive message. We’ll reserve a good time slot at the next meeting to discuss this. | . | . | ASWF Board strategy meeting on Virtual Production - David Morin . | Want to poll TAC meetings about VP . | A short history: trace origin to beginning of VFX industry, a need to connect devices to drive authoring experience on the software side. Phili Tippet on Jurassic Park, “dinosaur input device” allowed animators to animate characters, pointed out how useful these were. Evolved to the virtual camera, Peter Jackson on 2001 on first LoTR, Camera / Avatar on 2008, 2012 on Gravity. Now widely used in the industry. | Next step was VR with FB acquisition of Oculus in 2014, film makers could step into world with VR goggles to get immersion, for instance Lion King. | Can we share virtual worlds instead of individual experience of VR? Use of LED walls demonstrated benefits of shooting VFX. VP is no longer just used for VFX heavy expensive movies, but being used widely. | Industry Initiatives - SMPTE . | RIS - Rapid Industry Solutions . | Produced a wall chart that represents Virtual Production . | . | vpglossary.com - VES Tech Committee, ASC, Epyc, a web site and a Discord server to discuss various terms, hoping to grow to be the place to define terms and make sure we have a common vocabulary . | Other initiatives in various guilds . | What can specific things can the ASWF do to help in the areas of real-time virtual production? . | pollev.com/aswf live poll . | Metadata standardization to all for interop of systems . | Asset IO / interchange for more flexible workflows . | Improving the integration of open standards such as OCIO, OpenEXR and MaterialX with real-time pipelines in addition to off-line pipelines . | Investigating technology to democratize virtual production for studios of all sizes . | Gap analysis of data standards needed to support virtual production (gaps in existing standards and missing standards) . | Production grade colour calibration solutions for display technologies used on set (ocio) . | Solutions for pipelining realtime technologies . | Superior device interchange data formats (tracking / input / etc… VRPN is old) . | Wire protocols to communicate between packages and devices . | The next OpenEXR for virtual production . | Library to better integrate digital camera with physical camera (metadata flow, etc . | Camera + Display interop solutions to enable DOP inputs and LEd display response to be integrated (more usable shots!!!) . | Identify “orphan” but important VP open source projects that could benefit from being part of ASWF . | . | In some contexts it’s early, but VP also borrows heavily from existing broadcast, VR standards. VRPN is quite old, we need more modern solutions that can be integrated. Problems have been solve by other industry the technologies were borrowed. | Michael Min: the USD camera initiative is already happening . | David: WG may look at a problem, provide conclusion and closes, or transforms into a project like we’re seeing with Asset Repository, which could be a good example of how to proceed in the future with forward looking WGs. | David: poll will remain open for a few hours if there are more ideas, results from Governing Board: . | Improve interop between traditional DCC apps and realtime apps leveraging USD . | Develop an open standard for real-time assets with behavior (drivable cars, camera models etc) so that they can transfer between applications and to consumers . | Add several “quintessential” real-time virtual production environments to the digital asset library. Consider several that are suitable for today’s hardware and software and several that are out of reach of today’s hardware for real-time work . | Establish and write sample code to establish a standard protocol for virtual cameras to interface with DCC and Game Engine applications . | Haven’t focused on VP myself much but are there any utility libraries (managing timecode, data processing etc) that are common across different implementations that should be encouraged to submit for consideration? . | Look at all interface points between tools and between actors and, if there’s a problem to be solved that’s appropriate to the ASWF to address, facilitate open source solutions . | Create and document a standard for a parametrically defined human that is suitable for real-time . | Create toolsets to help automate multiple LOD model and texture creation . | . | We don’t have to get involved with VP, but it is a topic of much interest right now. | . | Project Updates . | OpenCue : Brian. Spending time at TSC meetings to discuss details of proposed user and permission systems, in the early stages, what it will look like, and how it will integrate with some of the other authentication systems already in use (AD, LDAP). Don’t have a lot of experience in the TSC, so looking for experience / advice. One of the goals for this year is improving documentation, was a mid level goal last year and didn’t make a ton of progress, so highlighted for this year. Looking for tech writing help, looked in the user base, companies represented on TSC but not much success. So wanted to bring up to wider TAC, proposal is to establish a tech writing resource for member projects, or maybe LF can help? Could be beneficial to all member projects, Open Source projects can use help in this space. Is there any appetite? John: have worked with some people in the past, can possibly provide help. Michael Dolan: OCIO would be keep to leverage such resources. John: would be useful to scope the expectations, what’s the current state of documentation for the project, how much effort to maintain it. Brian: will start discussion thread and talk to Michael to help coordinate. | Raw2aces - Kimball. No TSC meeting, but repo is moved over, prepping contribution from WETA. | OpenEXR - Cary: on the cusp of new release later today, patch release with some bug fixes, vast majority caught by OSS Fuzz project. | OSL - Chris: presentation from Intel about planned work to support new line of GPUs, SPIRV backend for OSL, ties in well with work for NVIDIA GPUs. General refactoring to support multiple backends. Able to better customize callbacks, nice chunk of work happening in that area. Discussion on the space between OSL, MaterialX and USD, specifically talking about way that renderers approach binding a shader to a scene, beyond just the “one material to one shape”, hierarchical approaches beyond USD approach, rep from AL presented their approach. Planning to wite something up to bring up in other forums. Jonathan: a topic of interest to MaterialX, hoping to have presentation from Autodesk at next TSC. | Cory - USD: Most activity in subgroups such as MaterialX and Camera. Michael Min: USD Camera has been busy, getting folks from other part of industry to contribute, what is it that makes a CG camera / match move camera, provide a community to share. Motivating discussions upstream at vendors, trying to unify data being generated, and what maps to a CG camera. Foundational work, lots of energy. Cory: USD MaterialX is just starting, discussions about scheduling, discuss interrop between USD, MaterialX and Hydra. Also discussion on WebAsssembly, looking at creating simple web apps as demonstration of the technology. Presentation from Blender about their USD integration at last session. | MaterialX - Jonathan: Autodesk has contributed large feature, full support of MaterialX API via Javascript, now have a simple web application that lets you view MaterialX materials in the browser. Have heard of an effort to build a graph editor. Integration with NVIDIA Omniverse, and AMD with their library which uses MaterialX . | Assets Project - Eric : project going well, AL will check in a version in one of our repo to shake out issues in the process. Working with Amazon on the rigged character asset they are contributing. ASC StEM v2, 16 minute reference footage film, added clause to the license that’s been approved, ready to use that license. 10TB asset that we need a place to host and serve up! Stretch goal to get that done by March 10th to show at Open Source Forum. | OpenVDB - Ken: started conversations on roadmap for V10, due in November, looking to be a big release, gave a presentation on a new command tool, a lot of high level functionality in OpenVDB was only exposed in DCCs, now available as a command line tool. Hopefully will make it into V10. Will present V10 list next TAC meeting. | OpenTimelineIO: Nick - Trying to get things in order for a 1.0 release, in the middle of procedural bits like getting DCO automation setup, going smoother than it did for OpenEXR, good that they laid down the groundwork. | Rust WG - Scott: main goal is to get OpenEXR bindings handed over to OpenEXR project, also a bunch of people interested in building bindings for the other libraries. Trying to create a template project that people can use as a basis for creating their bindings. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | D&amp;I goals / initiatives for 2022 . | Spent time planning 2022 initiatives . | Have bird’s eye view broken by quarter . | Q1: need to get GSoC application in, Carol taking point on this, other members to help check everything is in good order . | Deadline is Feb 21st. | Ambassador program: Sergio and JT coming up with examples of what ambassadors can do for each TSC. Will have intro meetings with each TSC . | Want to beef up what we’ve been doing on the blog front, want to have 1-2 posts per quarter. Have list of potential topics, looking to post on Inclusive Meetings. | For Q2 will be looking for volunteers from each TSC . | Focus on Summer Learning Program for people very early in their career, want to improve on last year. | Last year we focussed on 1 dimension of diversity, looking at more dimensions for this year. | Also for Q2, D&amp;I landing page needs to be revamped so it’s not just “in our heads / Google drive”. | Q3: executing on programs being organized in Q1/Q2, running GSoC and Summer Learning Program. It was a lot of work last year! . | Had a lot of success with career webinar programs last year, had a lot of attendees, and reposted on YouTube. Discussed whether we wanted to do more, but instead decided to repackage the ones we have, do a 5 min intro video, rework YouTube playlist. Will also offer Q&amp;A sessions where individuals in the webinars will be available to answer questions from schools and organizations. So more about repackaging rather than producing brand new content, there’s still a lot of value in those. | Q4: Bill Roberts had done presentations about the idea of being a place that can provide a D&amp;I framework just like we provide OSS, a place for small and large companies to look for D&amp;I infrastructure. We would like to try to drive this initiative. Identify a volunteer from D&amp;I group to pull together thoughts and examples of these frameworks from organizations that are already ASWF members to see a repository we would want to maintain long term, just like we maintain code. | Expect to hear from D&amp;I around Ambassador program this quarter, will drop into meetings, asking questions on how to quickly describe a complicated project. Will put out call for mentors for Summer Learning Program, had many people from technical side participate last year. May want to “stick to our wheelhouse” of being a software organization a bit more, last year we didn’t put restrictions, but our resources are technical / ASWF focussed, so to provide the best experience to mentees, it makes sense to focus it more on the technical side. | Kimball: we had talked about doing our own version of GSoC, is this related? Our own Internship program is not on this agenda, we don’t think we have the bandwidth this year to run both GSoC and our own Internship program. We want to focus on GSoC, but if we don’t get accepted, we’ll need to quickly pivot to our own program. We would like to do both next year, and we have ideas that don’t fit in the context of GSoC. Kimball: we should think about our own Internship program, may take a year to advertise. Carol: last year it came together at the last minute. | Larry: if we get into GSoC and we have more excellent applicants than fit in the program, we could add an “ad hoc” student / project, rather than a whole Internship program. Carol: yes, that makes sense and is possible. | Rachel: working on GSoC application, it’s a bit of a pain, but getting close. There are a couple of general questions, drafting answers but will share with TAC on a Google Doc. Will submit a PR to TAC repo with a README explaining the process, requirements to be a mentee with us (“submitting a PR” as a pre-requisite, shows basic familiarity with the process). Discussion on #diversity about hurdle of CLAs. Want to make it as easy as possible for mentees to apply. | List of projects with responses for project ideas. It’s not too late yet, but getting very close to the deadline. Can also share project proposals from last time. Let me know if we missed your proposal. | Rust WG | OSL | OpenEXR | OCIO | OpenVDB | . | It is a non trivial amount of work to run a GSoC project! . | Once we get application submitted, will tackle all the administrative aspects of running a GSoC project, will help shoulder the burden from the technical mentors, and use it as a way to build a more inclusive community with the mentees, help get them involved in other areas of the ASWF. | . | Kimball: Carol will be new TSC chair for OCIO, will ask for an update for next time. | Doug: thanks to Michael for doing a great job representing the OCIO TAC! . | Larry: the project is very impressive, especially if you look back at where it was, now it’s possibly the leading project we have in terms of tackling all aspects really well. | Next TAC meeting at HPA . | . | Project / WG review topics (brainstorm) . | What are good ideas for project reviews? Is the CII badge still relevant for instance? | . | Project / WG updates: . | OpenEXR / Cary . | Not sure if last release was before last TAC meeting, 3.1.4 with misc fixes, it’s been quiet since then. | . | OCIO / Carol . | TSC chair is now Carol, Doug staying on a Chief Architect. Third role in charter is ACES rep, Sean Cooper, will have updates about that soon. | General PRs and ongoing tasks, will be planning priorities for this year. | 2 project ideas for GSoC, should be good projects for qualified applicants . | Doug: will have presentation at HPA tech conference in 2 weeks . | . | OpenCue / Brian . | Missed a TSC meeting . | Continue to design user system, progress on Python installers . | Discussed GSoC but opting out due to lack of bandwidth . | Still need to kickstart discussion on getting tech writer help . | . | OSL / Chris . | Contribution from Intel changing the way renderers communicate with OSL, better approach through LLVM | . | MaterialX / Jonathan . | Vulkan support with Autodesk: Vulkan to work with rasterization and ray tracing. Want to improve interaction with OSL and OCIO. Creating a test render application, trying to make it work across all platforms. Improving Windows build process. Discussion with OCIO for better integration. | For GSoC, excited to work with it, but we already have a 12 week intern to develop an open source graph editor for MaterialX, so mentor time taken up with that. But would like to do GSoC next year. | Larry: last time we did GSoC, we had a channel for students to communicate, so your MaterialX intern should be able to communicate with GSoC interns. Jonathan: yes, that would be great. Carol: yes, that will be simple, there will be a channel on Slack where they can ask questions. May also be some additional community activities that MaterialX intern would be invited to. | . | OTIO / Josh: . | Getting ready to move repo to ASWF organization, pre-signing the new CLA to have overlap when the switch happens. Going a bit slowly but moving forward. | Will have 2 of 4 TSC members out for a few weeks, so things may be a bit slow. | Had good contributions, change to schema to allow for clips and timelines that are muted / disabled, that’s something that’s important for NLEs and we didn’t have support for that. Autodesk also proposing another schema enhancement soon. | . | OpenVDB / Ken . | Discussions about what’s coming down the pipe. Looking promising for Mathematica bindings, so all the OpenVDB functionality will be exposed in Mathematica. Some of the developers originally from Wolfram. | New techniques for surfacing fluid particles, many ways to surface point clouds, but ILM and DNeg have techniques they want to contribute. | Contribution from Dreamworks on how to blend level sets. Current technique is based on Union booleans, new technique avoids sharp edges. | Also still working on VDB command line tool. | Targeting OpenVDB 10 for SIGGRAPH . | . | Assets: Eric . | STeM 2: time to stand up repos and S3 buckets to hold TBs of EXR files. Andrew from LF RelEng is helping. ASC was imaging some kind of click through license, collecting usage info. We’re taking a more OSS licensing approach, conversations still going on. | Working on web pages and a logo (incorporates a film reel, cloud and slash-star from ASWF, star also suggests globing / universal nature). Looking at different variations of the logo. | David: can we announce at the forum? Eric: yes, that’s the goal. David: it’s the right time to announce it. | . | Rust WG: Scott . | Someone starting to create Rust bindings on top of OTIO C API. | Kimball: where are we with OpenEXR? Scott: still need to clean up our OpenEXR repo, and work on the CI. Some progress but still needs work. | . | USD WG: Nick . | https://wiki.aswf.io/display/WGUSD/Presentations . | Working Groups are doing great work . | Asset WG is progressing . | Lots of activity, all WGs added to calendar, so meeting links are now all public . | David: for the Camera WG, will have a number of camera vendors at forum, perhaps presenting an update on that WG would be good? Nick: yes, we’ve been making a lot of discoveries. Thanks to Joseph Goldstone for making a lot of good work. | . | CI WG . | DCC package components from Jeff Bradley: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xWExH2VMsXpb7XTDDKkQbl9Lpei9-zES-qml9lel0ME/edit . | updated mission statement: CI WG Revised Mission Statement . | Kimball: can do a review after the OCIO review next meeting. | . | . | Open Source Forum update / discussion: TAC segment . | David: Open Source Forum on March 10, a month from now. At the heart of it is the TAC presentation. Wanted to talk about it today, presented the overview of the Forum at the last TAC presentation. In person at Academy Museum, VES awards happening in person 2 days before, some overlap for in-person, will be online as well. TAC presentation is the center of it all, will have our own members in the room (please register at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_N2cMCsOsbKbIbFPR7Qk4gSqb2qRKjlDnQeaXNK7G0/edit# code ASWFOSF2022). Presentation is 1h, so at most 5 minutes per project / WG. May not present every project / WG, want to focus on what represents our activity in the last 6 months and is forward looking, also doing this for non-member company representatives, this update is as much for them as for ourselves. At the end of the hour, we’ve hopefully given a tremendous update on what we’ve done, pointing to our future plans, and demonstrate the value of joining ASWF. Draft document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fzt9uBCD9DljAjPPZueQhxW4vu3jnvUje0WSyeqaIKI/edit?usp=sharing . | Will review draft at next TAC meeting. There will be a slide template, currently in progress. | . | . https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k_RK_nvUQrrwK86APFLN2ABdO5dVzIvgcT6Ptqz0R0M/edit?usp=sharing . ",

    "content": ". | Open Source Forum update . | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fzt9uBCD9DljAjPPZueQhxW4vu3jnvUje0WSyeqaIKI/edit?usp=sharing | What are major themes we want to talk about? . | Each section could highlight how working with other projects | Want to show that there’s value being part of a larger organization | CI is a big benefit, so should be covered | Brian: we want to avoid every project and WG doing a separate discussion. Kimball: but yes, we don’t have atime for everybody to have 5 minutes, but can we combine some? Or have some flow / consistency. Everyone should have the chance to give an update. | Brian: could get dry if we go through each one by one. So yes, interesting to try to extract themes. | Missing notes from OpenVDB, OTIO, raw2aces, or the WGs. | Cary: most of the project updates will be a version of “we put out a bunch of releases, fixed a bunch of bugs, put out a bunch of documentation”. Is there a way to consolidate this / coordinate update fmor all projects? | John: could we leverage some of the graphics from LF? Wave: yes, some of the generated graphics would be useful. | John: what do we want to accentuate, year over year comparison for instance? Compare year they came in vs last year? | Kimball: could also show how releases are distributed throughout the year. | Cary: have a single timeline will all the project releases? | Should we talk about value of coordinate with VFX Platform? | Ken: should every project talk about its roadmap? | Kimball: having a coordinated single timeline means projects don’t have to talk about details of releases. | Cary: can make a blanket statement about the value delivered by the projects. Execs don’t want to sit through repeated statements from each projects. | John: goal of event is to show the center of gravity happening at the Foundation. Also how projects are growing in the industry. Get us out of the details of “how many bugs a project closed last year”. | Ken: don’t want to lean too much on dry stats of “how many commits”, gives a skewed view. | Could also be interesting to get description of integration of ASWF projects into new packages: OSL / MaterialX / OCIO integrated in more packages in the last year. Speaks to the power of ASWF in its ability to get more industry support. | Also a graph showing cross-pollination that happened. Could be moot for OpenEXR which is supported everywhere, but for some of the newer projects like MaterialX, it’s important. Kimball: similarly for OTIO. | Also recent work in Rez happening from Rust WG is another good example. Benefit to the project getting Rust expertise it didn’t previously had. | Kimball: separate theme of WGs having influence on projects, or vice versa | Cary: most important message is not “look at the great work we did”, or “look at work we are planning to do”, it’s “we need your (financial) support”. We need to phrase the dependency of our plans on additional support. It’s not an easy message to convey. | Wave: could be easier to say “this is where the conversation is happening, for open source in this space”. If you want to be part of it, you need to be part of ASWF. | Carol: yes, you need to be involved, and here’s why. Wave: showing how our projects are being used. Carol: or maybe an example per project. For instance increase in use of OCIO over time. We can tie back and credit ASWF with energizing of the projects. | Allen: how do you determine where a project is used in the first place, Rez has had this problem in the past. | Jonathan: based on conversations without ASWF forum. | Larry: transformed situation where each company may have had 1 or 2 experts on a topic, to now these people having a place to get together and accelerate progress. WGs are almost as important as projects, finally there’s someone to bounce ideas off and collaborate. Something that ASWF brings to the table that wasn’t there before. | Allen: could ASWF help track use of projects? Wave: there have been surveys, by ASWF, also at pipeline conference. Carol: ASWF did its own survey last year, but it’s voluntary. Larry: most projects may have an internal list of “films and facilities” that use the project, but you only know about the ones someone’s told you about. “Imdb for open source projects”? | Scott: expectation for presentation is that we wall grab from PowerPoint template, fill our section, put it somewhere, how will be presenting this? Kimball: good point, is anyone going to be in person? Carol: yes. Chris from OSL also. May need to ask someone who is there in person to be the “zoom proxy” to drive the presentation. Carol: yes, can do it. | Kimball: someone should give a 5 minute overview slide, and have all the presentations in a single deck to avoid lag of switching. Not sure how we’ll do timers. We’re not far enough along for messaging / roadmap, but should have OSL and MaterialX near each other, maybe also USD WG. | Cary: we should all weave into our presentations a statement about what we need. Members are probably asking themselves about their continued engagement with the foundation. We need to be clear about “how can you help”. | Scott: do we also have a point of contact to make sure that what we produce for each project / wg is in line with the overall “story” we want to tell? Kimball: yes, David will make sure the messaging is good. | John: we want to collect “enough” of the interesting stuff happening in projects. But the ask is to get some of the feedback happening in your project / WG in the document to have enough material. | Wave: “what do we need”, but also “what do you get of value” from this project. “Here’s why you want to be in the mix with out”, and not just sit on the sideline and let others do it. Jonathan: not just talk about projects integrating, but also talking about conversations between vendors and ASWF projects. Wave: in the Asset project, pulling assets from organizations that will be made available to the community, but wouldn’t otherwise have a home. | Sean: Do we want to paint a picture of the health of the projects within the ASWF? Need for contributions, funding… From outside perspective, maybe want to see more specific data, “you rely on OpenEXR, it needs help, and this is why and what it will do for you”. Kimball: we now have examples of projects like OCIO where contributions from various people can ramp up or down, people can attend TSCs. Sean: if we have a spotlight on a success story, for instance the Asset project, “less stick more carrot”. Take a positive approach. | Sean: we have the interviews of members on ASWF web site, could that be weaved into it as a form of PR? Success stories within our projects, for instance we could have an interview with Wave on the success of the Asset project. Trying to see if there’s a way to have ongoing ways to draw attention to our achievements outside of the Open Source Forum for instance. Kimball: yes, will defer to Alix. | Jonathan: should we focus on a handful of pretty pictures and talk over that, as opposed to a bunch of bullet points? Carol: it can be tricky to get clearance. | Carol: we want to fill out what’s already in the Google Sheet, is there a separate ask on top of that? Or will be need more? Kimball: meeting with David tomorrow morning, will put together the template slide deck and send that out, and then everyone can fill out their own slides. Can leverage Asset Project for pictures, and how they are relevant to each project. | John: if we can get that together in the next couple of days, we can put the whole message together. Need the data from each project / WG, doesn’t need to be beautiful as it will be reformatted. | Scott: step 1 is to fill out the document, once we have copies of the final slides, we can refer to our slides during our talk. Will we get a “speaker” link email? Deb dgiles@linuxfoundation.org from events team: can send a link to register https://events.linuxfoundation.org/aswf-open-source-forum/register/ (code ASWFOSF2022), and will send a link for joining virtually 1-2 days before event. Alix: also another email going out tomorrow with invitation details. Scott: will make sure to have the Zoom link ahead of time. Slide deck will be likely a Google slide deck so can add presenter notes. | . | . | Pipeline WG reach out? Scott Wilson will reach out. | Is there a proposal? Think so, something was written in November? | . | . ",

    "content": ". | At the Open Source Forum | Questions: . | Where do I find all the updates and what we are working on? | We will make the presentation available, it is not a public presentation, but can be shared with members. | Kimball: we don’t do a good job of publishing our roadmap. | If we were to put this information somewhere, where should it be? “One stop shop” for all updates, or look at individual project web sites / repos? | Up to date roadmap would be useful for people joining the projects, reuse the work that was done in the presentation | Individual projects / WGs can reuse their specific slide content | Could reuse the TAC section to add to the TAC repo | . | Sync up with VES Tech Committee last year, should we do this again? . | With the timing for SIGGRAPH / Reference platform, a good time to do this? | May not be as eventful as last year, since we have better coordination | Kimball: will set up a sync up | Cary: we should do some projection of releases throughout the next year, so have a collective plan in place before talking to the Reference Platform? | Kimball: so maybe in 2-3 meetings time, so we have time to think about our plans. | Discussion in context of not just Reference Platform, but also Desktop and Qt, is there a role for the TAC to play here. | . | Google Summer of Code (Carol) . | ASWF was accepted for GSoC! | TSC chairs / mentors: people working on their applications are looking for “good first issues”, so they can demonstrate that they can successfully build the project, sign the CLA, and submit a small change. | GSoC has opened up their admission process, much wider than in previous years. Submitting a PR for even an experienced developer can be tricky, so having Good First Issues set up is a good first step. | #gsoc-2022 Slack channel is open for people to ask questions / guidance. We may soon have an influx of people with questions. Mentors will need to help. Will try to take care of general issues (CLA, signing commits…). For build issues, will need specific project people to help. | We don’t know yet how many students we’ve been approved for. But expect a large number of applications. Probably half of applications will not qualify, but want to minimize this by making ourselves available. As org admins and mentors, take all valid applications and rank them, then we submit ranking order back to Google, and they decide how many we get. A guess would be we might get around 4? Larry: limited by number of people committed to being mentors. Last year we got 3, but hard to tell. Carol: we have to do more work before we get a realistic picture of what things will look like this summer. | D&amp;I group will create a form letter announcing ASWF’s involvement with GSoC, individual TSCs can send a version of that letter to their contacts to encourage people who wouldn’t normally apply to GSoC to get a greater diversity of applicants. You can also do this on your own of course. | . | Kimball: Thank you again to everyone for all the work that went into putting together the Forum. | . ",

    "content": ". | Discuss technical writing capabilities / assistance (CP) . | Carol: link to proposal | Useful to write a proposal as to why we want / need Technical Writing, this one is OCIO specific | Is it worth asking for funding? Do other projects have these needs? | OCIO needs more than just documenting the code base, that part is pretty good, needs ongoing work, but it’s under control. What’s not there are things like how to use OCIO, how to make sure that everyone has the same expectations of what it means to support OCIO in your software. | Have had a WG for 12-18 months to try and standardizing around UI/UX considerations for OCIO. Have relied on early standards established around how UIs should work around OCIO, and the industry has standardized on current ACES config, that’s help since it provided a starting place. But still lots of inconsistencies around functionality, different apps deal with automatic conversations differently, may or may not be transparent to the user. Color picking also a source of differences. We think it should be more consistent between OCIO apps. | This proposal is based on the work of this WG, with a link to the full document. | It’s a lot of work to get this document in a final form that end users could take in and digest, this is what the writing proposal is about. | Need someone to be hired to help with the writing work, not only do we not have the time, but also not the skillset. Would like this done well, by someone who’s job it is to write technical documents. Will need to work with this technical writer, may not be less work for the OCIO team at first, but with it long term. | Went through exercise of how we would expect this to work, 1-2 days a week maximum, estimate what would something like that would cost. | Wanted to present this to the TAC. | Kimball: ACES at one point didn’t want to mandate a particular UI, but to get ACES certification, you had to get certain components in your app? Carol: not the first time the LF has done something like this, outcome could be a conformance program, but first need to establish what the guidelines should be. Kimball: can put you in touch with tech writer team at WETA, other member companies may also have tech writers, could count as a member contribution, apart from writing code. Or at least could put in touch with resources. Carol: want to identify common needs and trends between projects, how do we use funding and is this a good way to use it. John: from experience, least attractive job in open source is writing documentation, across LF projects, project communities can churn out small pieces of documentation, but hard for large documents. A tech writer is useful, they can help put that together. LF has used freelancers with success, the document put together by OCIO is a good first step to scope the work. A challenge with tech writers is how to scope the project, easy to eat up a lot of hours, fixed bid can result in more accountability. Best if can define what is the scope of deliverable 1 to get out the gate. Lots of learning in this process. | Kimball: suggesting to get tech writers who have that job, but could use people who work in the current M&amp;E industry. John: hardest part is finding Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Brian: tried to find tech writing resources within companies on the TSC and didn’t have any luck. Carol: had benefit of Autodesk contribute a tech writer to get over the hump for 2.0 release, took a lot of work to get up to speed, but may have hit the limit of the resource contributed by Autodesk. Consistency is important, would love to be able to have someone who is consistently available through the process, as opposed to only having intermittent access. Also want to keep the voice consistent, and not have to “retrain” multiple people. Would like to get the process done in a smooth fashion. | Kimball: we need someone who is paid to be on retainer, however many hours to help all the projects. John: looking at document, might be helpful for me to join more OCIO TSC to ask more questions, and figure out how to move forward. Also can join a OpenCue TSC. Brian: still working on final list of what we need. | Carol: not expecting final decision today. Jonathan: on the alignment between projects, the OCIO documentation is great, including the web site, would like to borrow ideas that are shareable, would like to borrow ideas to up level our documentation. That can improve harmonization across projects, and increase the quality of documentation across projects. Carol: we need a document describing how we did our documentation, how all the pieces and systems fit together. It’s not all that complicated, but leverages a number a tools, and no reason to to reinvent the wheel. Jonathan / Larry: want to second how well the OCIO documentation works, OCIO had a separate documentation subcommittee that met weekly for months, it was not a small feat. Project that wants to emulate how well that turns out may need to emulate the amount of work. Carol: needed to figure out what direction wanted to go in. Sometimes you get a pretty result, but it was a lot of work to get there. | Kimball: seems the next non-strategy meeting of the Governing Board should explore funding for something like this. | . | Linux Task Force . | Linux task force presented by Nick Cannon at Open Source Forum. Focussing on desktop experience, anyone interested should run out to Kimball or JF. Looking at various distributions, and looking at where to go next, how to keep Linux a core desktop environment for our community. If anyone has anything to contribute, feel free to reach out. | John: Jim Zemlin had offered resources at the Open Source Forum, did this happen? Kimball: don’t think anything happened yet. John: can help find the right people to engage. | . | Updates | Tentative: Pipeline WG proposal: . | https://github.com/pypeclub/aswf-wg-pipeline | Scott: letting someone else organize the group (Rust WG is already a lot!). Carol: how to they propose to control scope? Scott: studio pipeline tends to be unique per studio, but if you dig to the core, for the most part they are all similar, initial scope would be to identify common components. What if a new studio pops up and needs to start a pipeline, ASWF could provide a pipeline with all the resources you need to get going. What is a shot, what is an asset, what is a publish, can we be in sync when it comes to terminology. | Kimball: could it be like the Virtual Production glossary? Scott: could start with that approach. | Kimball: do you think this working group could help bring more people into the foundation? So it’s not just the same group, spending time on another topic? Scott: I think so, I’m a pipeline TD, and could see more pipeline TDs get involved. A common thread between pipeline TDs is moving between studios and new studio has just started setting up their pipeline, so have to rewrite something from scratch. So people “in the trenches” could help put together something that could get started. So I think the answer is “yes”. | Larry: what do you see as specific deliverables? Pipelines tend to be very studio specific, so what parts could become portable? Pipeline means different things to different people. Scott: core elements that you would use. For instance the Shotgun Toolkit provides the core: entities, path resolution system, how to publish, how to save your files… But that’s tied to the Shotgun ecosystem. WG or project coming from WG could be an open source back end agnostic core foundation of a pipeline, as time progresses, could start adding more “opinions”. For a studio focussing on episodic work, here are tools that will get you 90% there. Or could just focus on foundation. Talked briefly about what a non-legacy / cloud native pipeline would look like. For instance using an object store for your objects, how would that look. Could be a layer on top of the core infrastructure. Core infrastructure has entities, layer on top looks at files, the higher the layer, the more concrete / specific you get. | Carol: there could be a lot of directions this group could go into. There are things in here that could be interesting. When I read this, let’s not reiterate what’s already been done. A taxonomy has already been done in the context of a “traditional 90s VFX pipeline”. We don’t necessarily need a “what to name things” group, since that’s been done. But a “pipeline next” that identifies the missing bits.. “What tools do I need to write to get to a specific result” is how pipelines are built. So may be hard to envision a “pipeline WG”, what would be the deliverables / goal? Just making it open source may not be enough. | Scott: may not have an answer on that. Carol: we want to continue having discussions. Sean McDuffee: M&amp;E has been in a POSIX / NFS world for a bit too long, there are interesting things happening in the HPC world that could be of interest to look at. Also the underlying fundamental data models, how to store and retrieve files, could this use modern HPC filesystems. Scott: yes, that seems aligned with the proposal. What is the next stage of what a studio pipeline could look like. Original thought was more along the lines of “here’s what we consider a good, solid foundation to build your pipeline upon, but need to consider the cloud”. For instance how do you sync between the cloud and your studio, what tools and technologies could be provided to help manage that. Also a new studio starting out, how do you hit the ground running without having to write a ton of tools from scratch. | Kimball: should ask to reconsider the scope to narrow down to make it clear what the WG wants to work on. Seems to be the general feedback from the group? Allen Rose: is it an incubator for other projects, break off other pieces of work that could be tackled. Or maybe conversations can be more informal, and spin off WGs for specific topics? | . | Tentative: OpenFX project proposal: . | https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/message/2122 | Proposal to the mailing list, with some back and forth discussion | Larry: not necessarily a complete proposal, more of an introduction. Some questions may be “what the intention is” | Kimball: there’s some source code involved, include files, sample plugins | How do we want to manage open standards. | David: OFX is a good example of a set of libraries that has both open source and commercial aspect. Existing ASWF projects are being used in commercial projects. Larry: commercial use makes these projects work! David: some companies have used open source to advance their own needs, we may come in touch with those in the future. OFX is a good project to develop our “muscles” around those areas, possible improvements between open source libraries and the ways people use them. Also how we would want to clean up the ecosystem if we wanted to. | How does an existing foundation joining a LF foundation work? John: was involved was an independent project called ODPI, was an independent organization, merged into LFAI project, had to merge governance structure, membership tiers, was more complex since there was significant revenue and assets involved. Right now in the process of doing due diligence to understand what this could look like. From the email, seems like there would be a welcome to fold in, but they may be looking more at the benefit of the TAC. To comment about standards: ASWF hasn’t done a lot of standards work, but LF has a lot of expertise it could contribute. | John: these types of conversations would likely happen at the Governing Board. David: yes, will take care of it. The TAC decides whether to accept the project, but also develop a good vision with the people from OFX as to where it should go from here. Joshua: would be good to hear from OFX project what is their vision and hope to gain from joining. | Michael Min: could they be a TAC participant like USD without being an official project, does it have to be a project? Kimball: interesting question, do we need a group focussed on open standards, more than some of us may be interested in. Did interface initially with Bruno Nicoletti on creating the OFX standard. | Larry: have never used OFX, can someone speak to it? Also if what we saw in the repo is just a PDF that lays out a standard, would be a more meaningful debate about becoming a caretaker. But there’s code, lots of our projects make a standard + API. Is there a missing library that should be fully fleshed out that would give a substantial improvement? Or are their header files already fully fulfilling the need? Header only libraries have value. Kimball: at the time OFX was created, it was the least common denominator, so hard to do anything that’s performance. Deke: Katana supports OFX. Larry: if it needs a complete rewrite, that’s a different thing, may need to start from scratch. | Kimball: it may have undone that, some things were added for threading, GPU support. | Carol: have used OFX in a couple of situations, have some OCIO OFX plugins, useful way to demonstrate functionality. But don’t suggest using it in production. There’s usefulness in debugging. But the foundation should get behind such a standard we would want to use in our projects. | JF: OFX plugins used a lot in mid tier facilities. | Kimball: we should have them present, seems the general consensus. Does it have wider implications for us becoming a standards body… | . | Tentative: WG mission statement update process (context of CI WG) | . ",

C++ layer) | . | Mature: in wide commercial &amp; open use since 2004.

Pierre: haven’t heard of it! Gary: mailing list management has been an issue… | Larry: the repo is mostly header files, how much do the host and plugin developer has to write, how much redundant work is there between hosts and plugins, should there be more of a library. Or are the header files all you need? Gary: API spec is the header files, which is the defined interface. But there is work every host and every plugin needs to do to implement that. The C++ layer should wrap this up. Pierre: by design, it’s not a library, want to be able to support all kinds of hosts, from simple video editors to complex compositing systems without having to support everything. There is a handshake mechanism to allow the plugin to understand what the host supports. Gary: have written lots of OFX plugins, tend not to use the C++ wrapper and write directly to the API. Dennis Adams: the things you have to implement are host specific, with the exception around parameters. If you were writing a host from scratch, a library to deal with parameters could be useful, but if you already have it, you wouldn’t use it. If you are writing a new plugin, typically use an existing one as boiler plate, not too much from the plugin side you wouldn’t be writing yourself. | Larry: how stable has the API over time, are there issues with backwards compatibility? Gary: make sure everything is backwards compatible, if people are careful. Mechanism to negotiate between plugin and host. Standard may have become “excessively stable”… Pierre: not being a library means we can just add to the headers. | Christina: interested in what a reference implementation would look like. Pierre: wrote a “property tester” at some point, have open source hosts like Natron that implements the entire API. Dennis: there are required suites and optional suites, no way to enforce that everything needed is implemented, each vendor typically has a “kitchen sink” plugin that tests everything. Typically test against the most important commercial plugins. A Conformance Test Suite (CTS) host and plugin would be useful. Christina: different hosts would implement different parts of the spec. Pierre: some hosts return misleading info about what they support. | Joshua: curious as OFX as a way to model video effects in OTIO. Pierre: the data model of OTIO needs to be defined to it can be a suite in OpenFX that talks to the data model instead of talking directly to the code. Joshua: looking to get a timeline renderer (offline), is there a body of open source OFX plugins that would implement standard wipes / dissolves? Gary: yes, all the TuttleOFX stuff is open source (from Mikros). Pierre: it’s a bit old, so not sure it’s an actual “reference”. Gary: the plugins would be able to do this. Also open source plugins that ship with Natron (outside of OpenFX project). | JT: Is Natron still in development? Yes, it has restarted, a developer who moved to Amazon has it as his weekend project. | Christina: what industries is OpenFX mostly used in? Gary: Film / TV / Commercials, editing and VFX. Pierre: Resolve has free version, and OpenFX is their plugin API. Because of that, that’s a large user base. Christina: is there a predominance? Pierre: started with Compositing / VFX, now see it in video editing as well, color grading. | JF: does OpenFX say anything about ABI? Gary: no, since it’s headers only. Whatever compiler you need to compile for a specific host, OFX will work with that. Pierre: when started to support M1, it mostly just worked. Gordon: for a target application, you need to match that application’s compiler chain and library version, but can’t use a simple compile of a library? Gary: from experience back at GenArts, only had a single OFX plugin set for Windows / Linux / macOS (same at RevisionFX), since the API is C only, so no issues of ABI compliance. Only export 3 C symbols from the plugin, then it’s manually created vtables. Plugin as insulated from the host as possible (can still get symbol clashes). Dennis: plugins can take multiple images in and out to create transitions, not just one image in / one image out. Can also have zero image in for “generators” (like noise generators). All “read file” are zero image in, one image out. Can be plugged in to various places. So more than just effects. Pierre: can use it for zero image out for tracking for instance, just writing to parameters / data blobs. | Kimball: will probably need to figure out the integration details at the organization level. | . | OpenColorIO ASWF TAC Update - April 2022 (Carol) . | Also Michael Dolan, Doug Walker, Patrick Hodoul | Contributor Data: project health, how we are running within ASWF . | 321 commits, 3.83M LoCs changed, 25 contributors, from several different companies | Large chunk of configs from OCIO-Configs-ACES repo | Large contribution from Autodesk | Good growth over last 3 years | . | Technical Steering Committee . | Chair: Carol Payne (Netflix) Chief Architect: Doug Walker (Autodesk) | TSC Members: Remi Achard (DNEG), Mark Boorer (ILM), Mei Chu (Imageworks), Sean Cooper (ARRI), Michael Dolan, Patrick Hodoul, Carl Rand, Mark Titchener, Keven Wheatley | . | Current staffing level . | Currently have about six people contributing at least 1 day/week | Another six or so that do an hour or so per week | Occasional sporadic contributions from a wider group | Estimating about 3 FTE equivalents currently being spent on OCIO | Autodesk remains the largest contributor | It’s an on-going challenge to staff all the activities- need more help: . | Keep the lights on (answer questions, investigate bugs, keep the CI running, approve PRs) | Do OCIO meetings, ASWF TAC, other ASWF projects, ACES, GSoC, marketing | Develop configs, tools, documentation, UX guidelines, SIGGRAPH courses, website | Discuss, specify and develop new library features | . | ASWF should consider encouraging more than 1 FTE from members | . | Completed Releases (Doug) . | Delivered releases: v2.0.0 on 28-Jan-2021, v2.0.1 on 4-May-2021, v2.1.0 on 31-Aug-2021 at SIGGRAPH, VFX platform asked for 2022 release to be finalized by end of August 2021 (also v2.0.2 on 3-Sept-2021). Was difficult to do that by August, agreement would be to lock the API, and complete features at an end of year release, that worked reasonably well (v2.1.1 on 14-Dec-2021). Would like to have a “beta” release around SIGGRAPH, since that’s best time to interact with user base. Would like to have this conversation this year. Kimball: VFX Platform will come to present at an upcoming TAC meeting. Also v2.0.3 release at 16-Dec-2021 (bug fix / minor enhancement). | V2.1.x delivered new features highlights . | ACES 1.3 reference gamut compression | OpenFX plug-ins | Python Package Installer (“pip install opencolorio”) | Open Shading Language (OSL) | Metal Shading Language (APple contribution) | OpenGL ES | PyOCIODisplay | Imath 3 | Focus on connecting with other standards | . | . | Infrastructure (Michael) . | Infrastructure has settled / become mature: CI, GPU CI…, hasn’t changed a lot but some improvements: . | CI support for VFX Reference Platform CY2022 | CD Python wheel build/release on tag push | OpenColorIO-Config-ACES config artifact CI | Biggest win was supporting Python Wheels, makes the library more accessible to users on a large number of platforms. Would be useful to look at as a wider initiative across ASWF projects. | OpenColorIO-Config-ACES repo, using GitHub Artifacts feature. Lots of dependencies, can be involved process to build a config. When a new change is pushed, CI pipeline will build a config and make it available as a GitHub Artifact. | . | . | 2022 Plans . | V2.2 release for SIGGRAPH (tentative plans, under consideration) . | Milestones on GitHub page | Built-in default config(s) . | Allow OCIo to provide basic color management without an external config | . | . | ACES Config for v2 . | Three brand new, fully supported ACES configs . | ACES Reference Config . | In pre-release | Intended for development &amp; testing, not for production use | . | ACES CG Config . | In pre-release | Self contained config designed specifically for fully “computer generated” workflows - animation, graphics etc | . | ACES Studio Config . | In progress - pre-release in a month or so | Closest replacement for the previous ACES configs, but new, shiny and making the best use of new OCIO vs features! | . | . | Working group meetings - every other Tuesday @11AM PT | Join the #configs slack channel | . | UI/UX Standards and Documentation Updates . | Status: . | Monthly working group | UX guidelines for app developers | Coverage for user facing OCIO features | Standard page template with: . | Background | Resources (links) | Use Cases | Guidelines | Mockups | . | . | Up Next . | Plan to hire technical writer | … | . | . | . | Discussion Topics . | OCIO focus has been on feature development, but needs to transition to long-term resiliency | ASWF focus has been on growth, but should likely transition to long-term resiliency . | New features, new projects… | But need to use our resources wisely, long term resiliency of projects. Joining ASWF has been a huge boon for OCIO, but still in constant concern of what happens long term, what happens if you lose a core developer. How do you keep the project healthy long term. Doug: looking for advice, takes a lot of work to keep a project like this going, as this becomes relied upon by more and more applications and studios, important that it stays healthy. Carol: important that we have discussions on this topic, we could use double the developers to keep this project going long term. | Members should commit more than 1 FTE? Carol: we had talked about not enforcing the 1 FTE rule, but more members are probably already contributing more than 1 FTE. | Larry: we may want to keep an eye on the ratio of projects to premiere members, as we take on more projects, there is a danger of diluting the FTE contributions. Carol: yes, the ratio is important. | . | How do we grow our contributor base? . | Software engineers, of course, but also… | Website, documentation | Marketing, recruitment | Project management resources | . | Technical writing resources (documentation, user guides) | Integration / CD . | Artifacts for releases (storage, etc) | Should this be standardized | . | Release schedule . | VFX Platform release in the fall? | . | . | David: strategic questions are really important, we can do a strategy meeting at the TAC like we do at the Board, “who do we want to be when we grow up”! | . | .

    "content": ". | Larry Gritz leading meeting | ASWF Governing Board upcoming meeting . | Project / WG leads to provide updates | . | Google Summer of Code (Carol) . | Not happy updates: only received 1 application | Lots of theories about what it happened, not necessarily what we did as AWSF, Google changed a lot to the program last year and this year | Smaller organizations getting a lot less organization from GSoC applicants (like ASWF) | So unless OCIO approves the one student we got, we are done | Larry: we did the same as previously 2 years ago when we got dozens of applicants | On GSoC mailing lists, other projects experienced similar | Not sure we need to do a deep post mortem, seems to be mostly due to changes on the Google side. | Appreciate all the work that got done to get the proposals ready | Larry: what’s the plan B, we still have the room to mentor students, do we have time to do something on our own? | Carol: we would be doing a disservice to try to do something on our own for this summer, also don’t have funding approved. Seeing what’s happened, we’ll keep an eye on it and see if they make substantial corrections, but we should do our own program for next summer and start planning now. The attraction of GSoC is the wider pool of applicants and notoriety of the program. But if we don’t get that anymore, may not be a reason to keep participating. | John: heard similar feedback from other projects that ran into similar situations. LF can help with individual programs, also can run through LFX platform. Can do a spring / summer / fall term mentorship. Sometimes get more candidates during spring / fall even with overlap with school year. Can work help get a proposal to the Governing Board. But yes, probably too late for this summer, but might be possible for Fall, or 2023. | Larry: we now have a longer time to plan for 2023 for a project on our own. | Carol: still have Summer Learning Program, people signed up to be GSoC mentors can consider mentoring for Summer Learning Program if you have time. | Larry: another benefit with going on our own is that we can make the outreach a bit more targeted, and go outside the bounds of who GSoC might have accepted. We can look for more experienced people such as grad students for instance. We have a set of projects that are a bit complicated for beginning students. So maybe this is a shift in our approach. | . | Project Reviews . | There is a mapped our calendar of what’s coming so projects have a heads up, and get feedback on the last project review, OCIO. | JF: OCIO put the bar pretty high | Larry: did that capture the info we needed to hear? Do other projects know what they are in for to prepare their report? | Cary: we need to get our ducks in a row first, experience of a healthy examination of the project, which would be good for everybody. | Carol: was great to present, would like to see a bit more discussion, we were a little rushed, future projects reviews should leave time for questions around the project. Larry: any feedback you were looking for? What can the TAC do for the project? | Carol: brought up a couple of things around CI, how we talk about project health and measure how many developers are involved, should metrics play a larger part in determination of project health. Are other projects aligned on VFX Platform / release timing (need to have 2023 release 6 months early). Doug: more of a 2 way conversation between the projects. Learn from the expertise of the group. How do we maintain the long term health of the project, and every project wrestles with that. Looking for new ideas on how to do that. | John: can you talk about the long term health concerns? Doug: for OCIO, when we look at all the things we’re involved in, not only developing the library but the documentation, educating the community, answering questions, CI… there are lots of tasks, and always struggling to make as much progress as we would like. Also have several WGs going. The more people we can get involved and have them put in serious time, do code reviews… it’s a struggle to find people to do that. As with many ASWF projects, it’s a steep learning curve, a lot of the contributions is from a relatively small number of companies / members. Most of the TSC members are people from large VFX studios and a couple of vendors, would like to get more participation from outside. More students contributing for instance. Student contributions have been difficult to convert them to regular contributors, not just doing a single contribution. Except that other ASWF projects also wrestling with these issues. | John: challenge of Open Source is the “scratch your own itch” model, good in a lot of ways, but converting someone from interest -&gt; contributing -&gt; maintainer is driven by someone’s interest. “We have lots to do and not enough hands to do it”. We should look at what all those things to do are, should we get doc writing help, it is a skill that can be contracted out to a degree. This is a good exercise to do after these annual reviews: identify challenges, getting deeper, can share guidance from other projects (foundations). Sounds like every project may be struggling with these issues, could be a workshop at SIGGRAPH between project leads to come up with some ideas? We are stronger as a group, the more this can be shared, especially in an in person setting… Carol: a separate forum for this discussion would be great. Right now OCIO is doing OK, but looking at the future. This isn’t a warning about the health of the project, but looking longer term, looking at how widely OCIO is being adopted across the industry, it’s growing and want to be good stewards of this project. John: good to think about this now rather than later when it’s a big problem. Sean: when adding Rez to the project, a bit reason to join was to get ASWF support, does the ASWF guarantee support to a project, or is it more a forum of like minded people. John: “support” can be defined in many ways. Around ecosystem building, infrastructure, open source best practices, foundations are most effective in this area, can bring expertise across LF areas, security initiatives… A lot of the model at ASWF / LF is more around “teach someone to fish”, give communities the tools and resources to help be successful. Can be funding for documentation, mentorship, infrastructure, and being available for advice. We aren’t the ones that will “get things done”. | June 1st: MaterialX | June 15th: OTIO | June 29th: CI WG | July 13th: OSL | July 27th: OpenVDB | SIGGRAPH | D&amp;I, Raw2aces, RustWG, OpenEXR, R&amp;A WG, DEPEL, Rez… | . | Discussion around OpenFX . | Hopefully people have had a couple of weeks to reflect on what was presented | Pierre, Gary and JP from OpenFX are here | Christina: feel like it’s a good fit, seems to be interest from other projects from OCIO and OTIO to work with OFX, good crossover. Initially wasn’t sure since it was more a specification than an implementation, but we would be able to include specification based projects. | Carol: a reservation, not specific to OpenFX. One thing we brought up is we need to be considerate of our resources, we have a lot of projects in incubation, would be interested in thoughts as to whether it’s good to let other projects coming in at once. | Pierre: the project might offer additional resources, don’t need additional resources from the ASWF. | John: are you thinking more in terms of projects come in, that would distract from people already contributing from other projects who might diminish their contribution to existing projects? Carol: thinking both. | Larry: not sure someone spending time on an existing project would diminish their contribution, more likely to attract new people. But it does add some organization overhead, there will be a time when there are more projects than slots in the year for yearly TAC reviews! But we will have to tackle this at some point. | Cary: I support without reservations, but OpenEXR may not get project review until next year, there’s a lot for this group to consider. | Doug: not specific to OFX, we have a recommendation that members of ASWF are supposed to contribute 1 x FTE to ASWF projects (or open source in general?), that’s another aspect, the more projects we have, the more this effort gets diluted (unless we get more member companies). | Larry: not sure that we’ve ever had a problem with companies wondering where to put in their FTE, they seem to have figured out where to allocate those resources. Not sure we are resource limited in this way. More work to be done to encourage contribution past the FTE commitment. | John: one way to navigate this, some time last year, TAC approved a Sandbox stage, so it can come into incubation stage as a strong project with a roadmap and a community. For projects in incubation stage, first months is getting everything in order, then it’s a quick shift into growth. Sandbox stage can help separate those stages, and ASWF can have to give less support at that stage. If there is a concern from the TAC on the resource side, the sandbox stage might be a good option. The TAC can have a quarterly touch with sandbox stage project. | Larry: sandbox stage seemed to be more for “speculative” projects that are starting out, whereas OpenFX seems like a mature project, been around for a long time, integrated in a variety of products, they already have a foundation. They are way beyond the sandbox stage, as opposed to a project like raw2aces that feels more like a sandbox stage project. OFX seems to be well beyond that. John: yes, I agree, more about reminding the TAC about the sandbox stage, and possibly as a middle ground. But yes, this is a mature spec. Larry: could get confused by abstract notions of what happens when our organization gets too big, we should look at that separately from the OFX proposal. Are we “assets” to each other, is it valuable to other projects. | Eric: are we ready for a vote? | JF: propose a motion as an incubation stage, Sean: second. Ayes, one opposed, looks like a pass. Welcome to OFX, congratulations to project #11! | Larry: Project #11 in our 3rd year is not an alarming growth, should be OK! (compared to CNCF!) | Larry: will need to assemble a TSC, when to hold meetings, meeting list, Slack channel. Pierre: talked to John and David. Need to vote on the OpenFX side as well. John: will follow up with Pierre for next steps for infrastructure. Will make sure it’s on the agenda for the next Governing Board meeting. | . | Open Discussion for next TAC agendas . | Should project reviews be shortened and doubled up to avoid taking up all upcoming meetings with project reviews | Sean: should project reviews be done in a single day, like a BoF at SIGGRAPH? | Doug: projects could record a presentation so the time during the TAC could just be discussion. Eric: need to trust that people do the homework. John: other projects have dedicated time, will schedule over the year when project reviews happen so it’s not too “lumpy” and everyone has an opportunity. Also make sure it’s “timeboxed”. Larry: how does CNCF do it? John: next size up of LF foundations that has 20-30 project reviews, try to focus on high level, key accomplishments, project lifecycle. Larry: is what OCIO did last time overkill? John: for other foundations, their TACs have less of a technical review, more of a project health review. A way for the project to voice concerns and opportunities back to the TAC, ask for support. Carol: OCIO might have approached presentation differently if we had been told 30 minutes instead of a full hour, so we need to make sure that projects know the timeframe. Larry: also first round of reviews for a project that’s been in ASWF since the foundation began may have had more “backlog” to communicate, and a lot has happened in OCIO. So may not be representative. John: very detailed presentation may be more appropriate for Open Source Days. Carol: if we stick to 30 minutes, with 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for discussion, but only have a TAC meeting. John: historically, this group has had the time to do the “around the room”, with 11 projects + 5 WGs, there may not be that time anymore. Structure / format of TAC meetings may need to be adjusted. | Erik: project update may be different if it’s the first time in a year, vs 2 minute update every 2 weeks. John: projects can have just specific announcements. Gordon: Autodesk have joined R&amp;A WG last week, proposal to contribute core of RV to ASWF, will be working with that group to see how it fits with studio contributions, so anyone interested, come join the discussion. John: would be good to rotate R&amp;A sooner rather than later. At some point R&amp;A may need to become a real project. Larry: can be horse trading on the schedule, projects that are scheduled for later who want to come earlier, that can be arranged. Michelle: yes, list as put together arbitrarily, could be more of a “sign up” type list. | Cary: could have a kind of “report card”, not something as formal as CII badge, but a standard set of questions, so that things that are OK (for instance) don’t need to be discussed. Carol: fine line between recording a presentation, vs dedicated time in a meeting. | OpenEXR was first admitted, more recent projects could come later, MaterialX just got their repo moved over. Let’s look at the list and maybe juggle the order. | John: would OpenEXR be up to go next? Cary: wouldn’t mind stalling for time a bit, 2 halves to the project update / review, one is the discussion within the TSC, take a step back from daily churn, then report to the TAC. But would be OK for June 15th. Cary: yes, that’s fine. | Larry: VES Tech committee presenting on May 4th, than May 18th is strategy session with David. So not until June. Can take discussion offline. Christina: need to tell Jonathan Stone that MaterialX is pushing back. John: can communicate with project leads. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Sync up with VFX Reference Platform is delayed . | But can still discuss it amongst ourselves | Round table around how this affects projects. Have all the projects made a proposed candidate version for the VFX Platform 2023? . | Carol: OCIO will be 2.2. Doug: provided feedback in retrospective we presented, we get feedback at SIGGRAPH, so ideally would be to present things at SIGGRAPH and have a bit of time to have time to finalize things. OpenVDB did October last year, that would also work out for OCIO. Last year we did 2.1.0 on August 31st to comply with VFX Platform 2022, but ideally would prefer October if that’s possible. Sounds like OCIO will apply for this “extension”. | Ken: OpenVDB has done it for the last 2-3 years and will do it again. Aiming for a major release, version 10. Kimball: October timeframe? Ken: yes, releasing 9.1 in a month, then going for version 10, which we want for VFX Platform 2023, aiming early October. Seem to have this conversation every year. Hopefully would be better if it was in writing, but there’s reluctance to do that? | Kimball: interesting they are looking at changing the compiler version but not the C++ year / level, would seem to be an easy(er?) thing to do? Larry: we could bump up to C++20? Kimball: not sure we’re ready for that! Do we know what C++20 support is link in Visual Studio? Chris: it’s a subset, doesn’t seem any compiler fully implements C++20 yet, so 17 seems like a more conservative choice. Ken: and less exciting! Kimball: really want the structure init stuff in C++ 20. Larry: we all have CI, we test against all the compilers. Chris: C++ 20 is actually fairly well covered across compilers: C++ Compiler Support | Kimball: would be good to add text to VFX Platform to deal with Clang, using libstdc++, but also want -fgnuc-version=9.3.1 to have headers behave correctly. How many are compiling with Clang? Larry: didn’t know about that. Test against gcc versions has to happen correctly, and don’t get treated as if you are a very old version of gcc and lose more recent features. Libstd++ s not technically but effectively part of gcc, they have checks in their header files on the gcc version. There are other separate packages that have tests against gcc version in their header files, for instance test for built in intrinsics. Could be added as an “asterisk” on the VFX Platform page. | OpenEXR: Kimball likely 3.2 | Nick: OTIO will be 1.0, but not part of VFX Platform yet | . | . | Carol: quick plug for mentor volunteers for Summer Learning Program, D&amp;I effort, completely in the ASWF. Entry level technical interest in VFX / animation industry. Looking for technically oriented students, window closed last week, will accept 20 people, so need 20 mentors. Lots of people did it last year, will put a bit more structure around what it means to be a mentor. Any TAC members are more than qualified if you have time and interest. No requirement for people to be students, just 18 and over. Got a great range of applicants, a lot are focussed on technical aspect of the industry. Also changed the learning platforms they get access to, one of which is fxphd. Will also use LinkedIn Learning. Program is June / July, 1-2h per week commitment. Focus last year was women, this year is people of color. Spreadsheet for Summer Learning Program Mentor Signup . | Sean: is reviewing done? Carol: yes, only need mentors at this point, already have enough volunteers as team leads. Larry: how many students? Carol: 20, same as last year, do a repeat of last year. May expand last year. | Wave: had good experience last year, was pretty easy, the person was motivated. | Carol: try to match applicants stated interests with interest of the mentor | . | Larry: cross group OpenEXR / OCIO meeting tomorrow, should we try to connect colorspace with OpenEXR header metadata, properly record how to do this and how to connect OpenEXR files to OCIO colorspaces. | An issue that’s come up in a lot of places, not sure we can make progress, but worth discussing. Is there a bridge that makes sense? Might be interesting to have someone from MaterialX also show up. Jonathan: relevant to MaterialX and USD, will try to attend. Will be important to deal with potential conflicts, what if a texture specifies a color space, and USD / MaterialX specifies another one? | . | Discussion on security issues in projects . | OpenEXR got an email from RedHat, are you assigning CVEs to reports from OSS Fuzz. Any other projects using OSS Fuzz? Otherwise you are lucky. | Larry: only assigning CVEs for things that are exploitable? Kimball: question from a security person, we typically don’t report everything unless it’s exploitable, otherwise it’s a “bug report about a bug report”. | Have had discussions around security reporting in the part. | Nick: had a rash of CVEs filed a couple of years ago, where were those coming from? RedHat / Debian directly? Maybe a CVE is a marker that you need to adopt an upgrade sooner rather than later. | . | David: we had earmarked next meeting to do a poll / design session to help figure out strategy. We do this on the board from time to time, we choose a topic to dive into, and Rob Bredow is adamant we only pick one topic at a time so we can go deeper. So would like to do a poll to suggest topics that we would like to discuss in this format. https://pollev.com/aswf . | Board has approved succession rules for itself, including term limits. Some applies to the TAC, some doesn’t. | Continuity planning: projects / WGs can still greatly suffer if a single person “retires” . | This can happen inside a facility, can have a single expert on any specific project. High “bus factor”. | . | Increasing long-term contributor base | Is it easy enough for people at member companies to get permission to contribute to projects? | Resource allocation and scalability | large asset storage for DPEL and other groups | New projects / tools needed to keep adapting to new business requirements? | Bringing in new members from outside of the ASWF | . | JF: would be good to learn from other LF foundations. | David: we’ll pick the “continuity” topic. Are we doing this at the next meeting in two weeks? Kimball: yes. Is there a project update scheduled for next meeting? No: it would be a full hour. David: so may pick a few of the topics to have enough to fill the hour. Think about these topics, bring so discussion points and potential solutions. | . | David: last board meeting discussed a succession plan. Board was presented with a vote on the plan. Came from the work of D&amp;I group that brought up lack of diversity on the board. D&amp;I did research and presented a number of ways board have dealt with this issue. AMPAS has also gone through that process a few years ago. This was discussed, board created a subcommittee to see what to do and presented a plan. | Term limits: 4 year maximum from start of GB membership . | 2 year breaks between terms | No lifetime limits for board members | . | Phase-in plan: . | By december 1, 2022, rotate out a minimum of 25% of qualifying GB members annually on a voluntary basis, with subsequent minimum 25% rotation targets each December 1 thereafter until all founding GB members are rotated out. | Reach annual 25% rotation goals by lottery if needed. | GB Alternates: | . | GB Alternates: . | GB members select an alternate within first 2 years of membership | Alternates serve as voting GB member when primary GB member is unavailable | Alternates can be changed at any time | There are no term limits for alternates | Phase-in: start introducing alternates in March 2022, all to be in place by 1-july-2022 | . | Diversity Goals: . | … | . | A deck has been put together . | Defines what a board member is | Not just people who show up at the meetings and vote on topics, but also ambassadors for the ASWF | Growth of foundation has hit a plateau, $1m run rate of membership, which allows us to operate, but proving difficult to get new members. Every new prospective member isn’t part of core member of companies that understands and uses open source, we have most of the companies in our industry who are OS savvy. Have talked to a company that has a lot of software and they use our projects, but they don’t think in an “open source way”. So requires education, “a longer sales cycle”. | Lots of companies present at the Open Source Forum, helping to enroll board members to help bring these companies in. | Room for new people to come in, will keep an eye on our D&amp;I ratios and goals. | . | Scott: what happens if it’s someone to retire from the board, but they don’t have anyone to take their spot? David: as long we didn’t have term limits, we didn’t think about it much. Now that we have those term limits, a board member knows they are only there for a certain amount of time, so they can plan accordingly, and be motivated to look for these people, and start by looking for an Alternate. So it’s not as big of an ask to ask someone to attend at first without initial responsibilities. Starts a process of internal communication to get ahead of the curve. We are looking for 25% rotation each year, when someone is getting closer to their 4 year limit, GB can help if a board member has trouble finding someone, can help the board member promote ASWF within their company. It sets a process in place. Similar to issue with project maintainers: when there’s no rule, people tend to stay for a long time, and don’t think about a succession plan until there’s an emergency. Having Alternates and Term Limits on the board forces you to think about succession. Without input from D&amp;I, board could have gone on for quite a while as it was. | Michael: are there conversations around member retention and membership happiness? Haven’t heard that type of focus, as we get new membership, haven’t heard about membership happiness? David: no, we don’t have a “meter” of member happiness, but a great question. There’s a membership fee every year, we have a discussion with our board members and general members, “happiness” is a sub topic in that discussion, is there anything ASWF can change. Have lost some members over the years for different reasons, a general member decided their fee would be better spent somewhere, some misconceptions at first, some companies think that at the general member level, they’ll meet a lot of studios and have PR opportunities. Have lost some Premier members since the champion who originally sold membership internally left the company, some companies went through more difficult financial times. Other reasons not necessarily related to “happiness”, but a great metric to have. | Larry: for Premier members, some decided it was worth spending the money for risk mitigation given their level of dependence on these projects. My employer was very pro open source, but there are now projects that we are critically dependent on than 3 years ago (MaterialX, USD, OTIO…). So we’re even more risk exposed. So maybe one way to measure the importance of ASWF. | David: should we do a survey of some of these parameters? Larry: Which of these projects would be in big trouble if it went away? David: could also serve in recruiting of external vendors. | Shout out to Animal Logic’s post about The Open Source Obligation, why they do Open Source, their ALab initiative. Encourage people in our member companies to make such statements to the outside world, state internally and externally the commitment to open source and the value proposition of being an ASWF member. Other companies will take notice, and I can use that to promote the foundation. “Happiness” and “Dependencies” are good benefits. | Carol: decided to focus on the Governing Board first, don’t want to take rash action with the TAC, how do we start talking about these issues in the context of the TAC, strategies around succession, long term success of projects is influenced by diversity. It wasn’t easy to do with the board, but it will be more complicated with the TAC. Larry: more leery of forced term limits for projects and TAC, but a good idea to designate an alternate. Is anyone else up on these topics, a useful exercise, maybe forcing everyone to designate alternates would be good. | . | . ",

Out of Cal State Monterey, the Computing Talent Initiative, https://computingtalentinitative.org/ we may want to partner with them instead of GSoC, could be good for this year. Discussing with them, please look at the email and see how it could work with your project. It’s a bit different with GSoC, but could be good for website, documentation updates. Somewhere between GSoC and Summer Learning Program. | John: we have some tech writer resources interested in working with ASWF projects, can make the intros to see what could work and come back with a proposal. | John: project proposal for OpenAssetIO, not going to discuss it today, but read up on it, and will be discussed on June 1st meeting. | Deep Dive Strategy Discussion with David Morin . | A version of what the Board does | We did a poll at last meeting to come up with topic, going to select top 2 | Soft Intro: . | Siggraph . | Poll:Do you plan to attend Open Source Days / Siggraph in person? . | Yes: 65% | Maybe: 10% | No: 25% | . | . | Achievements, challenges, opportunities . | Poll: TAC best achievements so far: . | Building community | Onboarding a sizable portion of the most critical projects in our ecosystem | Elevating the importance of collaboration | Facilitating the ongoing health of our projects | Working groups on many topics of common concern to all studios | Making new releases of software “normal” | Strong contributions to projects | Collaboration between projects | Making ASWF the “place to be” | Structuring our future | . | Poll: What is the TAC’s biggest challenge . | Project participation from people OTHER than the most senior people who do everything | Improving the “bus factor” of projects | Contributor growth | Scaling / returning value for paid membership | Helping contributors be successful | Path to long-term project health | Innovation in a changing media &amp; entertainment landscape | Standards | . | Poll: What do you think is the TAC biggest opportunity? . | Expansion of engineer participation in open source as expected part of their daily work | Diversity initiative leading to new contributors | Increased involvement from software vendors | Becoming the first framework considered when starting open source development projects for productions | Focus on common problems, together | … to provide more first party stewardship over OpenSource projects to improve success and execution: helping organizations through the process of open sourcing its technologies, maybe prof services from LF, mentorship | Help increase awareness of the reality of dependence on OSS and “normalize” structured company contribution | . | We may want to do a session about the concept of the Open Source Program Office . | TODO Group | Linux Foundation Training: Open Source Best Practices | OSPOCon Registration | . | . | . | TAC Continuity Discussion . | ASWF TAC Poll Results - May 2022 | Presented the Board Success Plan last meeting . | Term Limits may not apply to the TAC | But idea of Alternates may apply | . | Poll: Continuity Planning: suggest actions to insure continuity in projects and working groups . | More co-chairs | More extensive “onboarding” and overall ASWF process documentation at all levels - new TAC, new board, new contributor, new TSC members . | David: Board has created an onboarding document for new Board members, what their “profile” should be, tasks expected of them. | Carol: would be helpful for someone to become an alternate, but also people interested in how the organization functions, and might ask their company to be a part of it. Sometimes you get implicit bias, by making information in written / video form, there may be more people who realize they are a good candidate and can self nominate, helping to increase diversity. | David: when board identified issues based on input from D&amp;I group, they created a temporary committee to meet outside the regular meetings and develop a proposal to implement these actions. If the TAC thinks that suggestions on this list are worth pursuing, it has to be an action of the TAC. Maybe follow the example of the board, create a specific committee on continuity planning, and develop the documentation to introduce to potential new chairs / co-chairs. | Larry: some of the TSCs have a role of “chief architect”, one thing that allows is rotation of the chair without discontinuity in the technical lead of the project. You want someone who sticks with the project for a long time as the technical visionary, but still allow others to have a hand in leading the project. OCIO was the first group to do that. | David: would this apply to all projects based on that experience? Larry: not sure, maybe not every project even knew about this. Carol: process documentation based on the needs of the process, so that projects start on a baseline. Jonathan: MaterialX just wrote its own governance document, diversity of approaches between ASWF projects gave examples of approaches to take, were able to borrow from OCIO, OSL… So diversity of approaches across projects is helpful in this case. | David: diversity of ways to proceed is indeed beneficial. When it comes to continuity planning for the TAC, it won’t come from the outside, it’s for the TAC to decide that it wants to do it, give time and focus to the issue with a subset of the TAC for instance. | Rachel: having contributed to that Board subgroup, found it very useful to meet in a sub meeting to discuss continuity plan and come up with final proposal. Documenting the way different projects are providing continuity and sharing leadership may be a good way to welcome new projets, they have examples and guidance that having more than one person is a good thing. | David: asking Kimball to continue this discussion within the TAC. | . | Have all projects / WGs assign secondaries (maybe prefer someone already outside of the projects / WGs) | TAC chair should have term limits . | Kimball: could benefit since different people have different ideas of how to run meetings, what’s on the schedule… | . | TAC Chair should have term limits | Recommended reporting milestones (quarterly, whatever) to help project teams run to a clear delivery goal for execution or reporting on progress | Identify overlaps between TAC and Board identity (some were serving both) | . | . | Increasing Long Term Contributor Base . | Poll: . | Incentivize contribution in some way (community approach ala Epic Fellowship) | Path to Academy membership for long term contributors | Poll “how much red tape at your company for somebody to contribute” and work with member companies on best practices to streamline | Support from member companies to help train/mentor junior engineers on relevant projects instead of only relatively senior ones | OSPO at each member company to be part of the discussion (like the legal team) | Some kind of yearly “awards”, maybe part of the pipeline award effort . | Wave: if it was less about one person who did something, instead a group, like a dinner for a group at SIGGRAPH, a speaker. Trying to think of something inclusive, rather than an individual contribution. | Kimball: GitHub will 3D print your contribution graph as an award and mail it to you. Not sure what it’s based on. | Wave: could imagine different companies being able to sponsor a dinner, a tour. Something where it appeals to people to be part of that experience. | . | Publish list of open problems for each project | Require member companies to commit at least 2 FTEs | Call to action via campaign (Marcoms initiative) | . | John: is the use of a “claim” / “badge” popular in this industry? Are people familiar with this? https://info.credly.com/ is a way to issue digital badges, can be used to recognize certain levels of training courses. Have issued committer badges, can put on your social media profile. A nice way to offer a recognition to achieve a status in the community, would have to take the time to define the categories. | John: some communities set up an Ambassador program to help recognize people who have an influence in a community, recognize them to do talks, blogging… People get elected to Ambassador based on their contributions. Some projects also do annual community awards, could be overseen by the TAC. | Kimball: could have ribbons to add to the SIGGRAPH badge. | Christina: when people contribute to an Unreal release, they get a credit. John: yes, that’s a good practice and encourages contribution. | Carol: a yearly award doesn’t have to be fancy, we could run that ourselves, maybe in context of Open Source Days. | Poll: Expanding our base: in which technology category could we expand? . | Virtual Production | Themed Entertainment Technology (projection mapping, non planar displays, media servers / playback, control systems… etc) | Game Engines / Real Time Rendering Engines | Cloud Technology | Education / Higher Ed | Scientific Viz | Broadcast | Stagecraft (Virtual Production more holistically) | Marketing | Metaverse | . | There was a meeting at NAB to discuss the creation of an open standard for Motion Capture, including SMPTE.

We will know afterwards what SIGGRAPH wants to do, so we can pick between the two options. Apologies for now having a clear picture yet. Each option has its benefits, in both cases, it’s about what updates can be done at SIGGRAPH, at the past we had 45 minute presentations, now we’ll have some of these, but there are other ways to do these updates, maybe group some projects together. We will confirm very soon. | . | Ken: OpenVDB has a problem which is becoming a blocker, desperately need better hardware for CI system, can’t reproduce bugs reported by members. The problem is memory. We’ve watered down the build matrix, compiling on a single thread, using ccache. | Ken / OpenVDB: about to create PyPI packages, need to create an account, should we create an account just for our project, or for ASWF | Ken: do we have a process for announcing new versions, have just released 9.1, normally would announce on Google Forums, but retiring those. Is there a process where ASWF can announce these? . | Emily: have announced some on the blog. Will be working on a playbook around marketing and PR for the projects. | . | OpenAssetIO proposal / discussion with Mathieu &amp; Tom . | Link to proposal | Don’t have a formal, rehearsed presentation, send deck ahead of time. | Trust everyone has received the slide deck submitted for consideration for sandbox status project. | Mathieu: OpenAssetIO has been a project that has had a long journey at Foundry. Was founded in a lot of the research we were doing a long time ago around bridging asset management systems and DCCs. What does an asset centric world looks like, and if it was more native in applications. Have precedent in Katana asset management API. Big thing holding back the industry is having standardized system for talking about assets across multiple pipeline tools, different parts of the pipeline, physically / logically isolated parts of the pipeline. | Tom: built and end-to-end prototype, and enhanced the Katana API and showed it at NAB 9-10 years ago. It was a pure Python implementation. Realized needed to pick up this project again, and should do it in the open. Didn’t want to do this behind closed doors, so it’s being done on GitHub. Have had good engagement from early adopters, that has already helped correct some design issues. Keen to keep community centric development model. When heard about sandbox level adoption, felt it was a good way to get things going, leveraging the ASWF organization. Don’t want to hold any IP in this project, and want it to be community shepherded. Have been in contact with other ISVs, Blender Foundation, want good adoption on both asset management and DCC side. Want to be as open as possible. | Mathieu: talked to John Mertic about sandbox level, seems like a good fit. Project still in early phase. Any questions from the TAC? | John: the sandbox is designed for projects that are extremely early on. Maybe not a complete codebase, or scope not fully determined. But it’s important to have that work have a place where it can be nurtured to the point where it becomes a “well oiled” open source project. We use the same concept in other Foundations. If you don’t have a stage like that, the bar can be too high to join, and projects go elsewhere. The ASWF can give the project that space, lend it the collaboration infrastructure (Zoom, Slack…) Happens in view of the TAC which can be there as a resource, but also conscientious not to push too hard externally. Expectation is the project would be in sandbox 3-6 months, not more than a year. Time it takes to get the alignment together. | Sean Looper: is one year consistent with the timeline you have in mind? Mathieu: yes, seems consistent. A lot of the contributions so far have been done under the power of Tom’s team, seeing a lot of design discussions in WG, so potential to accelerate the roadmap. Key thing the project needs to get to the next phase is to have reference integrations. That’s when you can have a real insight of the timeline to move to a next phase, time to do initial integrations with in house pipelines, OTIO, connection to USD. | Joshua: happy to see example with OTIO, it seems to fit nicely with the media linker OTIO already has. Should be complementary effort. From OTIO’s perspective, happy to see this, addresses a problem OTIO has been asked about but which is outside the scope of OTIO project. | Sean Looper: you mentioned AR for USD, also Katana, any other applications in mind for reference implementation / integration? Mathieu: within Foundry there’s a lot of discussion of how to adopt this API, good separation between the project and the internal teams. Discussions with Autodesk teams, also the OpenPype system. Tom: there’s a bit of a chicken and egg situation. Have been focussing on our own applications, as well as OTIO / media linker. Have been talking to OpenPype, also discussions with MovieLabs around their ontology and 2030 vision. Started shared project with OpenPype and PipeClub to extend ontology to CG pipeline. Had a lot of input from larger studios through the WG, have been chatting with Blender Foundation. Still early days with commercial ISVs, been trying to reach out as much as we can, and happy to talk to anyone. | Gordon: do you have any studios on board yet / adopting the current API? Tom: a bit early on, currently converting the internal Python PoC into something ready for deployment, doing this in the open. Have had good input from AL, Pixar, DNeg. Blizzard made a good call to switching to batch centric operations, allowed switching to a different model before it was too late. Before end of year want to have reference integrations. Easier to communicate when you can show what the project can do. But a bit early for production adoption, it would be a bit risky. | Sean Looper: do we agree that it would be a criteria for transition from sandbox to incubation, how many studios have taken interest / involved in a project? | Carol: that can be part of it, since it involves formation of a TSC, with multiple members and companies. | Sean: we want to make sure that we have dates in place to make sure we don’t adopt projects that don’t have users in our base of companies we represent. | John: that’s a missing piece even in the adopted stage, we’ve identified that we need a healthy number of adopters, but not necessarily companies. Could be something the TAC may want to look at and adopt. | Sean: may be a natural consequence of the makeup of our voting members, not overwhelmed by vendors. But we may want to codify. | John: could be good to keep expectations set. | Erik: it’s a very high bar to display incumbent systems in studios. They are going to need incentives or improves existing systems while minimizing displacement. | Sean Looper: move to include at sandbox stage. Larry: do we want to give people time to reach out to people in their organization who understand this better? If this was successful, would it have impact on facilities, or would it be difficult? I don’t feel like I have that information. Sean: but isn’t this the point of sandbox? For instance our WG approach could be morphed into that a bit more. | Jonathan: don’t see any red flags, but could do more readings, in particular the GitHub. Kimball: can we do this in 2 weeks? Don’t want to leave things hanging for too long, and that’s the point of the sandbox. | Gordon: it’s a very interesting space, feels like there’s a lot of interesting stuff there. | Mathieu: one of the reasons we’re interested in bringing it to sandbox phase, looking for oversight and input from TAC members would be very valuable. Running WG on our own power, modeling it as close as possible to ASWF, but it quickly reaches a ceiling, duplicating infrastructure. We’re looking to bring the discussion to the next level without making grand statements about adoption, since it’s a chicken and egg problem. Hopefully no downside risk for the project. | Michael Min: sandbox can be a good place to even “find the value”, sounds like there’s enough validation amongst the community. Would be the place where it’s great to put the spotlight and have the conversations. We can give more time to read the doc, but the spirit of the sandbox is that there’s been work done, does it have the requirements to become a full project. | Kimball: instead of forming a WG, this is going a project, there will be code, there will be an API, so the sandbox seems like a good place. Let’s plan on having something formalized by the time we have the next meeting 2 weeks from now. | . | Review &amp; Approval TSC proposal / RFC - Erik and group . | TODO: add link to document | Expectations is to share draft memo, and give everyone a couple of weeks to digest. This is a bit different than what Foundarion has done previously. | Gordon from Autodesk, Larry from Imageworks and Roy from DNEG. | WG for Review &amp; Approval was first in stealth mode, then became more public a few months ago. 3 separate companies want to share code with the community. There’s a consensus that all the code is valuable, serves different potential markets, if we’re going to solve the Review and Approval problem, it’s not just about a player, it’s also about timeline, assets, annotations. Different than other projects where we take an existing project and put structure around it. | Trying to propose umbrella group around a group of projects, build a strategic roadmap for each project and build communities around each one, and integrate holistically so we can solve the larger problem. | This is new for ASWF, we think there’s a larger outcome than individual projects / contributions. We want to encourage community participation and expansion. The conversation about OpenAssetIO is on our list. | Proposing an umbrella organization as a TSC with a shared communal roadmap that attacks the problem, starting with the three projects submitted by companies. Then add to umbrella to address things in a more product centric way based on community feedback. We may not have a good answer for a specific point, does a community want to pick that up? Some work around merging annotations is a separate open source project that is interested in joining the foundation. | Challenges are: . | New strategy, not clear cut as to what output would be | More product focussed than what we’ve had in the past | Higher overhead costs, multiple projects under a single TSC (CI infrastructure…) | Sandbox style effort at this point, need to engage both product and program management. It’s going to take a lot of effort to coordinate efforts between several companies. Will require real resources, propose that ASWF may find a resource to have someone work part time on this from a program management point of view. | . | Contribution projects are: . | XStudio from DNEG: 2 year old review player that has been under construction inside DNEG, was expected to get open source from the start. Has OTIO integration, today it’s a standalone player, doesn’t yet have features for sync / multi site / asset management | Autodesk offered to open source some or all of RV depending on what makes sense. A lot of effort into structuring the object into modular components, allows to use as a framework / pick and choose components. | Sony Imageworks itview, focus on collaboration components. Itview has been around for 15 years or so, synchronization and multi user experience is strong, multi-participant reviews. | . | Want to end up with both a building block of components, as well as a more turnkey solution for companies that don’t have the resources to build it themselves using those components. | Best analogy to proposal would be the way the Blender project is run today. | Larry: OpenEXR TSC has split OpenEXR from Imath and manages two code bases that are coupled but independent. Similarly OCIO separates core libraries from configs and ACES. In many ways OCIO has been an inspiration for how this could work. It’s not 100% new ground, but we take it a bit further. | Carol: we do run OCIO with a single TSC, but have WGs under OCIO TSC: UI, config, documentation, operated pretty independently, in separate repos. | Gordon: there’s a belief that there’s value from all 3 contributions, they all bring something. Agreement that having a common player is valuable to the industry, but will take time and effort to figure out how that works. If we support projects individually under ASWF, it makes things confusing. Gives clear structure and message to people engaging with the project. | We want to be able to move quickly, can we approve both the model and the project at the same time through the TAC. | Carol: are you planning on moving all 3 code bases, as separate repos, then merge them? Gordon: trying to extract common framework, keep projects going and adopt common core. Erik: we think these projects can have legs of their own, merging the projects could happen in the future where a nascent project with its own repo is a collection of components from these 3 projects and others that makes a “new thing”, but that’s not the initial goal. Sorting this out, defining community needs and goals will take some time. Strategy about what a future combined project would look like is something we want to address. | Larry: the 3 companies are doing this “dance” of getting NDAs in place to look at each other’s code… Easier to just open source all 3 projects and then do it in the open. | Carol: lots to think about! | Kimball: struggling to think of this TSC as a “permanent WG”, or transition Review and Approval WG to a TSC, it has “done it’s job”. Erik: WG doesn’t have its own repos, a governing body, a lot of the mechanisms that the TSCs have to do things. We need the next step to have the structure in place, the governance… Localized decisions will have to be made for individual projects. | Joshua: appealing to have a single TSC across all 3 projects instead of separate TSCs. Forum for cooperation, this is what makes ASWF work well. If TSC sets up a structured way to set up this cooperation, it’s a hard problem to solve, but it’s encouraging. | Larry: part of the reason for this structure, didn’t want to end up with multiple, competing projects, desire future alignment, feels like it sends the right message. | Carol: a concern is the way forward could be one of those applications, what happens to the rest of the “abandoned” projects. A TSC is responsible for that block of code, now we’re talking about 3 separate contributions. We might have to work out a new TSC governance model. Would hate to have a bunch of dead projects, the ASWF is all about keeping projects alive. | Kimball: the reason why you would pick one over the other would also by nature make it a superset, and would show a clear migration path. | Erik: the subtle shift for the TAC to consider is that this is actively promoting is a new model, a shift in the direction of how the Foundation thinks about things. | Gordon: working out as an industry how we navigate multiple projects is an interesting problem, does it become a thin wrapper around common framework, do we retire… Great discussions for that TSC. | . | Don’t forget to fill out maintainer survey and project / WG board updates. | .

    "title": "Agenda",
    "content": ". | Quick governing board update (Kimball) . | Switching their meeting schedule around, will have a meeting at SIGGRAPH | Usage of Slack has gone up, which pushes us up to next payment tier, so that may be brought up. | David: ASWF is running at $1M/yr revenue, and our expenses have shot past our revenue in last few months. We do have a small surplus, but we need to “live within our means”, not let ongoing expenses to go past our membership revenue. Andrew Pearce (treasurer) has gone into details, one of the growing budget points is Slack, it’s growing and it’s good, but there are alternatives such as Discord. Are there ways to run this differently? Around $14-$15 going up fast (yearly). John: latest annual is around $20K annually, Slack is priced on a active user basis, want to be clear that it’s not a directive to get off Slack, but it’s a growing spend area, there are a lot of other things we would want to invest funding on. So is Slack is where we want to direct a lot of that investment in. Other LF communities have had the same discussion around Slack, some have decided to stick with Slack, others have decided to direct funding elsewhere (for instance Discord). But no immediate need to make a move. | Larry: want to push back on idea that there’s a “growing number of engineers”, the traffic seems pretty reasonable, the growth seems to be in general discussion outside of any project. Maybe that could be separated out in something else that’s free, while keeping actual project traffic on Slack? Kimball: yes, we need to think about this. | Carol: would be good for TAC to get a budget overview, give the TAC the transparency of where money is going, would be helpful and give context. For instance what does $20K mean out of context? Have to look at it in relation to other spend. | Kimball: reason why this is coming up is that yearly renewal is coming up. | Sean Wallitsch: we gained a bunch of Slack members after Open Source Days, so if we want to move to other platform, we might want to do this before next Open Source Days. | Joshua (chat): For context, it would be great to see a pie chart of how all our other expenses relate to this one are | Larry (chat): Re Slack: it would be interesting to know the number of subscribers, messages, or unique posters per month (or whatever stats are most relevant to how we are charged) broken down per channel | Carol (chat): the D&amp;I programs are likely a large contributor. OCIO currently doesn’t use ASWF’s Slack instance, we were considering merging… there is no rush to that, but that would likely be an add of several hundred folks in a short amount of time. | . | Member surveys (Michelle) . | Sent email about maintainer survey for ASWF 2022, only have 6 people who have answered, would be good to have more answers. | Also adding your project reviews to the agenda, no one has done that yet, please go in and pick your selection as soon as possible. | . | SIGGRAPH Updates (Emily) . | Thanks to efforts of many, SIGs can now be recorded, we are back to doing Open Source Days in person, Monday and Tuesday. | Keeping virtual presentations to a minimum, so won’t be widely pushing, but will be available for folks who need it. | Day 1 is bigger talks, hopefully get people to stay for the whole day. | Day 2 is more interactive, informal / BoF style, expectation that people go in and out. Also Board and TAC meetings. | Proposed agenda, up for changes based on availability. | We have 40 minutes slotted for most projects / talks, is that too much? Would you prefer 30? There’s not a lot of voices coming in from outside ASWF, industry talks, other projects. But most of the projects that used to be guests are now members. Don’t know yet who will present for USD. | David: draft agenda designed with Kimball, grouped projects in like minded categories. What are headliner topics that will bring in people to attend? Could start with USD update from a USD person, Board meeting gave thumbs up for general agenda. If we agree that we should have a USD update from the source, will reach out to Steve May at Pixar, asking Cory, looking for advice as to who would be a good person from Pixar to give a short keynote (30 minutes). Cory: will need to talk to folks to see if they have time given that they may already be planning stuff for SIGGRAPH. Also USD Working Group session, what would be the content? David: yes, good question. This is just a schedule, not prescribing what should be talked about. Could be shorter. USD WG has done collectively a lot of work / discussion, would be good to expose that to the larger community. Summary of the threads, 3-4 sub WGs, lots of material to report on. Cory: yes, will talk to the other members. David: will reach out to you offline to figure out how to reach out to about keynote. | Emily: tentative TAC meeting at end of second day, don’t remember if we did one before. Is there a desire from this group, is it too late in the day and need to take a look at another time? | Carol: schedule looks good, from OCIO perspective, we’ll take the time we can get, don’t want shorter. We’re not doing a BoF because of the costly registration, so it’s not worth it. So this is the opportunity to get an update out about work done, but would also like to have a bit of a discussion, sharing an advance of what we’re thinking about, maybe run a PollEV poll. Take opportunity to answer in this session, structure it somewhat differently than just a basic update. May release some updates slides in advance. We’ve been discussing this, and curious about what other groups are thinking they want to cover in their talks. | Kimball: speaking for OpenEXR, we won’t just be talking for 40 minutes, want to have a discussion about the future of the format, not just a presentation. | Emily: sounds like 40 minutes is the right time. | Emily: will be putting together speaker guidelines, and will have a presentation template to be used. | Will be hotel next to SIGGRAPH (Pan Pacific Hotel). | In theory you must be registered with SIGGRAPH to attend. | David: on the second day, we put the future of Linux for workstations (from Nick Cannon out of VES Technology Committee), second headliner that will relate to our community and other studios. | Side talks: . | D&amp;I panel accepted | Rust submitted a BoF | . | News Package: . | OpenFX | OpenAssetIO (?) | DPEL assets | Project releases? | . | Action item: get back to Emily about any conflicts. | For the Working Groups, could be a combined presentation for Rust and CI, Rust has submitted a separate BoF. | Joshua: OTIO team may only have a single person at SIGGRAPH, if we pre-record what we want to show, is that OK, or will it feel awkward? Emily: you are not the only one, if we pre-record, would be safer than having you doing it virtually. It is important that for any virtual presentation, there is someone on site familiar with the material, just in case. But it will be OK to pre-record. | Larry (chat): I think we had previously talked about MaterialX and OSL sharing a single slot, as we did last time. Jonathan: 40 minutes sounds like a good minimum length of time to me, though we have 7-8 proposed talks for MAX, and could easily use a full hour if it were available (as with OSD 2021). Good point Larry, though we’re happy to include overlapping talks (eg MaterialX closures in OSL) in the OSL event if that’s better. Larry: Is one of the MAX talks by any chance about the OSL+MX collaboration on standard closures? If so, that’s by far the most important thing OSL has to talk about. Jonathan: Yes, that’s definitely one the planned talks, and we’d be happy to make that part of the OSL event if that makes more sense. Either way works for us, and it depends on what other material might be available for each event. Kimbal: That is why they are still next to each other - so you guys could do a joint meeting together if you so choose. Jonathan: Agreed, Kimbal, and I like the adjacency of those two events if we choose to make them separate collections of talks. | . | Finish OpenAssetIO review (vote?) . | Tom / Mathieu are here. Any final questions? Should we have a vote? | Mathieu: thanks for comments on email thread, sparked up discussion, good to know that there’s interest in the project, and naming discussion is important. More importantly is interest in the problem that we’re trying to solve, want to make sure we are aligned with the interests of ASWF. | Carol: let’s do it! Motion for a vote, Jonathan seconds. | John: accepting at sandbox level? Carol: yes, that’s the motion. | Lots of ayes, any opposes or abstains? Nope. | Motion carries, congratulations! | Mathieu: excited to see what comes next! | . | Review review &amp; approval proposal, discussion, vote? . | Kimball: A different “beast” | Erik: have had great comments in the document since last meeting. There’s an additional section added by Gordon representing the plans of Autodesk of how to manage commercial RV alongside the open source version. We can’t be the ones supporting all the commercial RV users! Documents the clear separation of responsibilities, keeps the support piece out of scope for ASWF. | Erik: larger outstanding conversation is structural: we have 3 initial projects that want to come into the foundation, they all have their merits. We expect the 3 to ‘draft off’ each other, over time come closer to a single project. But initial goal is not to ‘slam together’ all 3 projects right away. Organizational piece is that in order for the vision to work, the 3 teams should have shared conversation about this strategy. There should be a community obligation to come together under a “umbrella” organization, binds the projects together to hopefully come to expected outcome of a collection of components that can come pre-assembled, or be assembled in different ways to make a full fledged review system. | The organization structure needs to be fleshed out: have some ideas of how to structure the umbrella organization, but haven’t worked out the details yet. Is this workable / does it make sense? Is a TSC the right place to do this? | JF: nothing says a project can’t have multiple deliverables? | Carol: I think the proposal is good, we want to be all aligned and settings folks up for success. Don’t have an issue with an overarching TSC over different projects, but these are individual projects that need governance as individual projects, what I’m hearing about RV or xStudio, they need to stand alone, they have their own goals. While I support the common vision, let’s take one step at a time, get these projects open sourced, work through the process of getting them into ASWF, then a fourth project could be the umbrella organization that works on bringing them together. For a certain amount of time, we’re going to need RV for instance, and that’s going to go into an individual project. People responsible for RV would have to wear two hats and also think about future integration with other projects? | John: some of the scope of this proposal is not only these 3 projects, but also outside ASWF projects? Erik: For the direct collaboration of having a future with a unified playback system, there’s value to the locality of projects, shared leadership. Makes sense to inherit from OCIO, but no desire to include their leadership, it’s a separate, standalone component that other projects already depend on. There are additional projects bubbling up outside ASWF that are contenders for use inside a system like this. OpenAssetIO would have an impact. Also OpenAnnotationIO, outside of ASWF, closely collaborating with WG, up to them if they want to become part of ASWF. | Sean Wallitsch: don’t see a world where the direct governance of these projects is run under ASWF, Autodesk isn’t going to run RV out of ASWF. The part we want to see under ASWF is the effort to merge the projects into a single deliverable. Doesn’t mean that entire project has to be run out of ASWF. | John: is the scope of the project more the coordination between these projects, and the projects remain single organization owned projects, or would the projects become individual projects, with a separate group that manages integration? | Erik: the intention from the companies would be that the repos would come under the foundation. There would still be influence from the companies, but the repos would be “neutral” under the foundation. Also clears up a lot of hurdles for these companies that are organizationally challenging to run these projects on their own, there’s a lot of value to have the code and infrastructure living under the ASWF. | Larry: the 3 companies did intend to make these projects community run, and see it as a feature that they are under shared governance. Don’t want the projects to come into competition and not work towards a shared future we are hoping for. 3 companies explicitly feel the shared governance is important. Gordon: similar scenario with OCIO, had some internal tech (SynColor), had overlap but was different, saw a lot of value to contribute our technology, but rebuild on a common infrastructure. Turned SynColor into a big piece of OCIO v2. Long term don’t want to maintain RV as a big, separate code base. There’s value on using a common player core instead. But there is a separate between the commercial product, license and support, not trying to push that to ASWF. But the core player, plugins, graph technology… At some point the proprietary layer will get thinner and thinner. We want to make sure there’s a sample player on top of the core of RV. Joint TSC would look at duplication of technology, pick the best and refactor. That’s what the TSC needs to figure out. | Sean: sounds like with 3 initial consumables, they would still need their own direction / governance, with overall goal of delivering a single consumable. Can we drive this from a single TSC? Larry: this evolves over time. But we wanted to feel as one team. Gordon: Autodesk is going to invest in this, there are 2 choices: can sit in uncorrelated group with its own roadmap, or under a shared umbrella, making it easier to eventually getting onto a common core faster. That’s what happened with SynColor, paused the internal development and put developers on the merge to make it happen quicker. Part of the contribution of this is the contribution of engineers. There are some studios with RV components that could be good to contribute. If it turns out to be 100% of developer effort is specific to individual project, that’s not progress. | Sean Loop: what’s the mechanism for making architectural decisions? Joshua: seems creating this TSC is the place to have those discussions. The projects already exist with their own directions, the ASWF can provide that place to find the commonality. | Kimball: may be a model to use to resolve future things. We had these discussions when Rez was coming in about how to integrate with other projects (spk). | John: this seems to align with a project in another foundation, 3 companies bringing in projects with some alignment, they created a similar TSC organization, with separate “squads” for each sub project. It worked well for them. (Zowe). That group tends to use their TSC as an architectural lead group. Some other projects do architecture work in a sub committee. | Michael Min: sounds like these projects are aware of the others, and already developing around the others. Are we over complicating things, and should we wait until we see actually coordination issues to create a common organization? Also there was a comment previously about how this might be a bit more “expensive” | Erik: CI/CD costs might be higher for running into separate projects? The value of the coordination is that the projects aren’t collaborating with each other right now, so we want to give them a forum, where can the alignments be found, look for community contributions for missing pieces. Having the projects coordinating independently feels like a longer path than putting everybody “in the same room together”. Don’t want to rely only on goodwill and timing, as opposed to active management of the outcome. Gordon: don’t want to short circuit the process, but will note that there’s a window of opportunity to announce this at SIGGRAPH, Kimball, is there a path we can look at? Kimball: we can vote now, or vote via email, we’ve done that before. | Carol: appreciate the discussion, similar to John. Would be good to have to have potential TSC members to raise their hand and document what is going to be done. Knowing there are dedicated resources for every project and with the overarching organization. David: agree with Carol, there’s lots of energy in the TAC, there’s the issue of how many projects being added, if we add 3 projects, where would new engineers come from, effort of open sourcing proprietary code. Someone mentioned cost, we need more members / other sources of revenue. Will this project bring new member companies, would be great to provide more resources. Are there other ways this could fund this, right now we don’t have the funds to hire specific engineers… This is a great project, and this is something the market needs. We might be able to create a membership drive around this. Feels like there’s another cycle of discussions we need to have about the next steps. | Kimball: Erik, can you incorporate feedback into proposal, tag some names. Erik: yes, will circle back with team offline, block out short term milestones, some filtering of the project needs to happen before they can be committed to open source repos. Like the idea of using this to draw new members to the organization. First example of an end-user accessible project, as opposed to libraries, so a lot of value to moving to that level, could have a much broader community. And we want to aim for SIGGRAPH. | Kimball: we can do vote over email so we can get wheels turning. Worth doing the legwork, likely to be one of the larger projects we undertake. | David: having a timeline of steps would be useful. | Chat parallel discussion: John: That makes a bit more sense. I do think there would need to be a separation of RV roadmap as a project vs RV as an Autodesk (or other company) product. So to be clear, all three projects would be a joint deliverable? And one consumable for end-users? Larry: Initially separate consumables, in some sense. Not unlike how OpenEXR and Imath are actually separate consumables, under one TSC. Kimball: But the end goal is to have one story to tell. John: Yep, that makes a bit more sense. Carol: though that is with the folks who know it best - are intimately familiar with that code. Same with OCIO’s two projects. John: this feels like https://www.zowe.org, another project I work with. 3 major components came from 3 different companies, overarching TSC. And then there are separate committer groups (they call them squads) for each component. And releases tend to be aligned for a single framework deliverable. David (chat): OCIO had (still has) an architect. Who would be the architect (or team of architects) for this project? John: At first, everyone will stick in their corners. Deke: except there is a large overlap in scope between RV and DNeg/XStudio. John: but over time, cross mingling will happen and new parties will get involved in other pieces. Which maybe jumpstarts the collaboration. Larry: I think we do not want 3 new seats on the TAC for 3 separate projects each of which is thinking a “me, you, them” mindset. The sooner everybody thinks they are one team, the better. Michael: Larry, I don’t think we’re at that point? Again, seems like we’re thinking ahead of ourselves a bit. Erik: I can build and org framework and the teams can put names into it. Consider it done. | . | Jonathan: CII requirements discussion | . ",

    "content": ". | Review and Approval WG Proposal . | Kimball: The review and approval group has added a bunch of additional information to their proposal, and I think it is in great shape, outlining this new and exciting path. Please see the updates if you haven’t: . ASWF: Review Platform initative proposal . | Kimball: We had hoped to have a vote via email, but the team took additional time to try to predict the future a bit, as well as tried to outline how they see all three projects working together with an umbrella TSC, and confirm their various commitments. They’ve also provided some answers to some of the questions raised previously. My belief is that this will help create a better whole than the sum of the parts but make up your own minds - we owe a vote tomorrow, so please come prepared for that, as in a sense we are approving three projects in one. | Any additional comments on the proposal from Review and Approval? | David: really like the addition of the timeline and the spreadsheet / list of members and potential members and roles. Great to see names that aren’t part of the usual group of engineers, addressing some of the concerns. List is not complete, no one from “X” studio? Have those been identified? | Roy: having a hard time to open the reference document. Primarily myself and Ted (?) and another person from DNeg. | David: will there be additional resources from DNEG? Roy: yes, will still have a team working on it, until we bring in a project manager to manage this project. Dedicated team for internal builds. | Michael: need to clarify the sponsor from the TAC to answer for the WG, who is the sponsor? Roy: can be that person from DNEG, since on the TAC and peripherally engaged with the project. | Gordon: happy to be that person for Autodesk. Erik: have representation from studios, want to condense to one individual to speak for the project. John: the fact you have 3 is a good sign, hard enough to get one. | John: the code bases coming in will initially be independent, while there are some differences from a functionality standpoint, there’s a fair amount of overlap between the code bases. Is the intention to help bring these code bases together, or keep them as separate code bases? | Gordon: had that question last time, predominantly it’s the role of umbrella TSC to figure out how to do this. Want to refactor common implementations, but figuring out how to do this long term is why we want to have an umbrella TSC. Roy: 3 solutions being put forward are delivering something slightly different, for instance X-Studio is focussed on user experience, RV has deep legacy functionality, there are components that can enrich each other. Allow organic growth. JF: projects could be used as a source of reusable UI components. | Erik: each project has different requirements, they each have valuable components to a complete system, but none of them stand as a complete solution that the industry needs. We haven’t figured out how to get there, while there is overlap, there are also lots of gaps that need to be filled. | John: that makes sense, sandbox stage is designed to get that consensus in place, will be a perfect example of a project going through a sandbox and coming out with an architecture and a roadmap, a good test of how this process works. | Kimball: WETA may also have components to offer. | David: are you going to aim for a specific plan of what the project would be? Erik: part of the exercise is to figure out what we need to do, each one of the sub projects needs to determine what its next steps are in alignment with overall umbrella strategy. Initial goal is to sort out what the direction of the projects needs to be, but also a bunch of short term goals. Already people are talking to Roy about additional resources around X-Studio. Strategy window is a bit vague, but conversation of how we come together as a group, eventually turns into a schedule / roadmap. | Gordon: 2 big things are: . | Discussion around requirement and feature set in common framework, taking a second pass over that, get it to a point where we can publish it and use it as guiding criteria | Starting to put concrete plans around what this common framework will looking like. What kind of steps to build this out. For instance step 1 might be that the playback core out of X-Studio is the one we want to use… Starting to put together concrete picture of what the common framework will look like. | . | Gordon: how the pieces of the common framework fit together, or maybe identify gaps in all the products. | Larry: all 3 projects are assuming they will put in significant engineering effort, not just remolding existing code. We know it’s going to be ongoing, real engineering work. | David: was worried about having 3 architects on the list, but everyone seems to be in sync, so that’s a great sign. | Gordon: there’s an org chart in the proposed document, one TSC with sub working groups, not 3 independent TSCs with separate TAC reps. There’s a place holder in the org chart for an overall architect, but haven’t worked out the set of skills needed for that role. Going to need technical leadership, but felt that without having had those discussions, aren’t quite ready to name who that would be. | Eric: when I see “Review &amp; Approval” on an agenda, that doesn’t mean much, so maybe consider bringing up a different name for the group? | Gordon: put forward motion to approval, Larry seconds. | Many ayes (including Joshua Minor via Slack), no opposes, no abstains, it passes. Congratulations! | Kimball: congratulations, our first big tool, different from libraries projects so far. | Erik: thank you, we have a lot of work left to do, appreciate all the comments on the document and the discussions in TAC. | Kimball: will bring this to ASWF board so that appropriate announcements can be made at SIGGRAPH | John: sandbox stage projects don’t require Board approval, so don’t need to wait. Erik: already connected with Emily on SIGGRAPH events. Kimball: will inform the Board. | . | Discussion around the CII badge system (Jonathan) . | Jonathan: a topic that’s been on our mind. John Mertic and I have been looking at what are the next steps for MaterialX to get to the adopted level, the main remaining requirement is the CII badge, now a Gold level badge. This is a requirement worth discussing, so far no ASWF projects has met it, and only 12 open source projects have met it so far, none in graphics. Want to discuss what it takes to get to this level, and come up with a strategy, there are no role models. Closest project is currently MaterialX, followed by OpenEXR, and we’re only halfway there. Wanted to see if other teams have thoughts on this. MaterialX Self Evaluation Worksheet for CII Gold Level. | Larry: this past week, was looking at the list, OSL hasn’t graduated yet and wanted to take care of it, thought there were only a few things to do. Looked at the difference between silver and gold: were at 93% for silver, but at much lower level for gold. Some of the requirements, don’t even know where to start. Is it an unreasonable bar? | Jonathan: can send a link to where MaterialX currently is. We’ve knocked out all the ones we can meaningfully accomplish with the project as it standards, but there are some security features that we don’t know what they mean. But wanted to bring it to this group. | Nick: OTIO stuck on the same security requirements, requirement for someone to take a course and become the security person. | Eric: does this effort bring value to the projects? | Kimball: we felt the early level brought value, we may have thought that raising the bar to gold wasn’t so difficult, and maybe it’s worth resetting to where we had started originally. CII Evaluation Criteria. | Cary: we had looked at this a long time ago, the first level we achieved, and thought that was a decent level of “busy work”, basic level of security issues. But it’s been so long… Remember looking at the Gold level and thinking it would be a lot of work. But is it really worth our time and energy, or better spent elsewhere? | Jonathan: MaterialX current at passing level, haven’t gotten to silver. Agree that getting to Passing level makes sense, when you get to Silver and Gold, it’s a more formal set of requirements. The ways you have to harden your project… we just don’t have the experience to know how challenging this would be. | Nick: OTIO is stuck, link to project board | Jonathan: passing badge had lots of good role models in ASWF such as OCIO or OpenEXR so we could integrate processes in GitHub Actions. But no one has achieved Gold, even rare in the open source community. | John: fair points shared here. Some background: these were things that started to come out when the Heartbleed OpenSSL bug came out. In post mortem, it was found that the relative amount of developer support and process / infrastructure was not equivalent to how much the library was used. How can we give guidance to open source projects so they have the right pieces in place so they can respond to security issues proactively / in a timely manner. When the badge was first rolled out, it was mainly pushing the Passing level, not so much emphasis on higher levels. Over the last year, more projects are starting to move to the higher levels, recognizing the value of these higher value requirements. Organizations are putting a scrutinizing eye to the projects they are using, what’s the diligence of the community around them (and that was one of the reasons for the creation of the ASWF itself). It is recognized that projects don’t necessarily have all the expertise and resources. Exploring the way for ASWF to offer security audits, for training, there are great free courses out there. Walking the MaterialX requirements with Jonathan, some require a fair amount of work to do, some less so. From a foundation point of view, we want to demonstrate commitment. Is this too much or not too much? Maybe in the context of the TAC, or a side group? Get a requirement of what the requirements are, what’s the achevability. What are the areas where the foundation could help with resources? Three years ago when we went through the same discussions, projects were able to work their way through it. We should have exemplar projects, how can we enable project communities to do this effectively. Going through requirements, understanding which are sticking points and identifying what resources would be needed. If there are points that we just can’t / won’t do, we need to identify that. | Larry: in favor of having a separate meeting where project representatives can sit in front of the list, didn’t do enough homework for this meeting. On all the levels, a bit of a ‘bimodal distribution’, a collection of requirements we already do or agree with, and another group we don’t know how to do, or know that the effort to do it wouldn’t be worth it to us, only so many resources available. | Gordon: would it be interesting to capture the ASWF view of what these items mean? List is not ASWF specific. Cary: a lot of effort is figuring out what the requirements mean. Kimball: some requirements are not relevant to us, we don’t store credit card info for instance. But a digital production library might store PII? Larry: other security related issues could happen when a library is used by a user facing system we never envisioned. We can’t really articulate the thread model we face. | Nick: may not be viable to populate each project with expertise. 10 years ago OpenEXR was contributed a fuzzing package, which made it easier to incorporate OSSFuzz. Cary: we also got a “kick in the pants” with CVEs being posted. We figured out a process and it was pretty straightforward. Dan Hutchinson at Foundry helped, came away from this discussion with feeling that OpenEXR was reasonably OK. | Nick: someone specifically on TSC should be the expert might be modified to move the expertise to the ASWF level? | Eric: could we identify such an expert? | John: can bring in Erik Wheeler to present, helped work on the requirements. Should this be a post SIGGRAPH meeting? | Larry: can we lower the graduation requirement until we work this out? We have multiple projects overdue for graduation, and are held back by this paralysis. Cary: makes no sense for new projects to be held to higher standards. John: TAC can wave specific requirements. Kimball: is this to get to Passing, or Silver? At the time we thought Gold wasn’t much higher than Silver. John: security requirements and test coverage requirements tend to be the worst hurdles. | Kimball: it would be good that if you have a file format that you read, that component of the library must be under OSS Fuzz could be a requirement. We could clarify as a group how to get to those levels. Cary: our experience has been positive. Kimball: helps the library get better. | . | Reminder to schedule your project updates if you haven’t already | SIGGRAPH related announcements . | Emily is on vacation this week | David: everything falling into place, back within SIGGRAPH, room has been confirmed at the Fairmont Waterfront near convention center. Have room for 2 days, with the option to extend on Wednesday morning. | Demand for additional presentations. Draft schedule from the last meeting is still the one being worked on. Hopefully everyone is thinking about their presentation! | There will be a slides template soon, with a main slide deck incorporating all slides. Mix of presenters in person and remote. Every project should have someone in person to moderate discussion live. | . | TAC sponsor for OpenAssetIO (John) . | Anyone want to be a TAC sponsor? Please let me know. | . | Interest in LFX Insights and LFX Security presentation to the TAC (John) . | Conversation on #wg-ci around some of the LFX Insight statistics are gathered, could bring someone from that team to present. Could be more interesting for the TAC as a whole than just wg-ci. Kimball: may also get to some of the CII badge requirements. Just received license audit for OpenEXR repository. | John: will work on that as a post SIGGRAPH activity | . | Update on Metaverse Standards Forum that met for the first time last week (David) . | First meeting last week | Led by Khronos group | Metaverse Standards Group Forum Plenary #1 6Jul22 Slide Deck | Metaverse Standards Group Forum Plenary #1 6Jul22 Recording 1of2 | Metaverse Standards Group Forum Plenary #1 6Jul22 Recording 2of2 | Agenda . | Over 650 members and counting, including ASWF | ASWF is thanked as part of “standards developing organizations” (we produce de facto standards) | . | Organizing for Effective Forum Action: created a Google sheet where each company can enter wish list of what the standard forum should work on | They want to work on practical projects from the start | Presentation multiple times on different timezones | Next meeting in 2 weeks, recording is also available | David OK with representing / listening in, when it gets to real work, will want someone from the TAC to follow this organization’s progress, to be prepared when some of our projects are asked to contribute / participate more actively. | 2 big chunks of technology being discussed: . | glTF | USD (and then MaterialX) | . | Roy: volunteers to follow work of Metaverse Group | Jonathan: very interested in MaterialX work, in close contact with Khronos, they will be speaking about glTF / MaterialX work at Open Source Days | . | .

    "content": ". | SIGGRAPH / Open Source Days . | David: we are having our OSD well on track, lots of back and forth with SIGGRAPH due to rules changes, unclear how many people will attend SIGGRAPH in person, some companies dedicated to sending group of people, others have backed away. | OSD: covered to have room at Fairmount Waterfront with in person, also covering with Zoom for remote attendance, with recording of sessions. | Agenda is pretty much set, a few open slots as of this morning, will get to it when we review agenda. | Should we look at schedule and look in order? Kimball: yes, that makes sense. | Need to have Experience Plus badge to attend in person, we’ve agreed to check at the door. Jonathan: what about remote attendance? Deb: our virtual streaming event is not being promoted publicly, so won’t be checking badges there. | Wave: seems fair to have “their rules” for on prem, but our rules for remote / streaming? | Keynotes: decided to merge ASWF and USD keynotes due to availability . | Summary of the year, summary at Open Source Forum, stats, growth, activity. Highlight of new projects. Steve May will join for panel discussion, update on USD, friendly support for each other, ASWF supports everything USD is doing to the best of our abilities, Steve will acknowledge work of USD WGs. | USD WG: how is that going? Do we have someone on the call? Nick: we have an outline, all sub committee members lined up to contribute report on their activities, and call to action as to why you would like to join regular meetings. Not clear that we have a presenter in the room, uncertainty about COVID protocol, nervous about being in the room. Deb: following SIGGRAPH Health and Safety rules, doesn’t seem to be much. Recommending but not requiring masks. Need to be fully vaccinated to get into Canada, but SIGGRAPH won’t be checking vaccination status. Nick: some people may be uncomfortable with small room filled to capacity. Not as rigorous as some of us would expect. David: if everyone is virtual, will need someone to host locally, be ready to pick up in case connection goes down, be able to run the meeting from the room in that case. Kimball: can click buttons on a presentation if needed. | How large is the room and how well ventilated is it? 70-100 people capacity, hotel banquet room, only information so far. Wave: will have CO2 sensor, can tell what the load will be. Deb: ballroom size in a hotel, 75 sets in the front for theater, 75 seats around tables at the back (150 total). Planning for around 75 in person. Haven’t heard specifically about ventilation improvements from Fairmount Waterfront hotel. | MaterialX (Jonathan): merging with OSL as a single event so we can have talks that overlap, Larry will gives his pure OSL update to close out event. 9 speakers, big line up, will use the full 80 minutes for the talk + Q&amp;A. Things are going well, working with visual theme of chess set contributed to ASWF to connect the talks. Encouraging teams that aren’t speaking to also contribute renders, will have lots of interesting images. Lucas Film has asked to present and attend SIGGRAPH remotely, so will be following this requirement. Will be leading the event remotely, and other Lucasfilm speakers will be speaking remotely. So would like a tech rehearsal to figure out how the mechanics will work, and how to handle any technical downtime. With 9 presenters, will likely be at least one person with tech issues. Larry Gritz and Chris Kulla will be live, but won’t be able to take on those duties. So could use some assistance to know the parameters and practice before the event. David: do we have a provision for a tech rehearsal? Deb: can’t do anything in person, don’t get the space ahead of time, just using Zoom meetings, so can just use Zoom Meetings. Jonathan: parameters of event last year was very different than what I had access to, as soon as we got into the meeting, we were immediately live. Had never seen the moderation platform before, didn’t know how to handle feedback from attendees. So it was a challenge I’d like to avoid this year, don’t need the live part to be present, but would like to rehearse the handling of comments. May not expect lots of online comments since we’re not advertising that part, but more how to interface with in-room crew. Jonathan: last year we had lots of virtual questions so had to cut them off. Will there be a facility for remote attendees to ask questions? If it’s not supported, then it’s a non issue, last year we had so many online questions. Nick: the questions pile up quickly in Discord and Zoom channels for the BoFs that have already been posted. People are asking questions in too many places. Carol: there will not be a lot of virtual attendees, right? Deb: we’re not promoting it, it’s not on the web site, we’re not sharing it through SIGGRAPH, it’s only for community members not attending in person, but not sharing it publicly. Jonathan: historical for OSDs, Lucasfilm has done a lot of promotion, on Twitter channels for instance, should we not do it this year? Should we be intentionally quiet? Deb: we are walking in a grey area with this virtual element. Can still promote the in person event? David: online is for our own community, so could be promoted internally, but don’t want to put it publicly. Wave: historically I’ve promoted this internally at Apple via Slack, consider those to be ASWF community? Would be great if we could get where to point people, if they have to get a personal registration. Tell people what to do, obviously for people not at SIGGRAPH. Carol: we don’t have a virtual option this year, only for presenters, that’s the approach I’m taking, it’s unfortunate, but we’ll be able to share the recordings afterwards. Jonathan, makes sense, but the big downside is that we’ve cancelled our BoF to concentrate on this event, this is where we’re placing our effort to publicize the project. David: we’re working in a grey zone, for the people who need the update and are part of our community. We’ve been asked by SIGGRAPH to “not ask too many questions”… Wave: if we can say something the lines in private channels, “if you have questions you want to ask, submit them here”, and the speaker can address those in the talk. And point to where recordings will land. Kimball: Slack channels are also community. Wave: have lots of people working with me are peripherally paying attention to what we do and would like to answer questions. Cary: for OpenEXR, planning a very brief / cursory update, and mostly looking for a discussion of a few critical topics that we would want feedback from community. Will flesh out at TSC meeting, reach out to some people to encourage to participate to get discussion and guidance from the community, not planning a significant project update. Jonathan: puts us in a difficult place, would not feel comfortable recommending that people show up live. David: it is valid to have member of community to attend virtually. SIGGRAPH model is a bit out of sync with current situation, they have changed from not allowing recording. Have to have our community participating in OSDs, that’s the message I will give at SIGGRAPH. Carol: it’s a really confusing message for us, don’t know whether I can share this with people, how do we define our community. Would like to invite people around the world who use OCIO but don’t necessarily participate in ASWF. So I’m more confused than before! David: recognize we’re in a moment of ambiguity, we don’t have clear answers. What we need to do is balance this, not going to put Zoom /virtual registration links on our page, don’t want to challenge the SIGGRAPH rules. How do we define “members of our community”? “People who are important to our projects”, but don’t want to advertise publicly. Use our Slack channels to reach the people who have been working with us and would like to see the update, but we’re not there to challenge SIGGRAPH, we want to work with them. We all have to adapt to post pandemic world, same thing for the conferences. Eric: consider our Slack channels are publicly viewable? David: we consider it our community, so it’s OK to post on our Slack channels. JF: could we have an agreed sentence about not reposting to public forums (Twitter…). Jonathan: also need a backchannel communication with event team in case issues come up, would still be valuable to have a Zoom practice, not just for Q&amp;A, prevent things from breaking the way they did last year. Deb: team is traveling next week, but can set up an identical meeting we’ll be using. And can set up a Slack channel we can use to chat. Will also have phone number to phone / text me, will be the onside contact. David: there will be a slack channel for OSD speakers for out of band communication. There will be a chat in the Zoom, may not be usable if there are too many people, someone will keep and eye and see if there are questions to be extracted from it. Deb: will try to set up a meeting / rehearsal. Jonathan: MaterialX TSC has a meeting next week, if we want to steal this time, it would be worth it. Next Tuesday at 10:00 PDT. David: instead of doing a meeting per group, would it make sense to set up a rehearsal at the time of this TAC meeting, next time on Wednesday? Carol: people can jump in and out? Seems to make sense. Jonathan: yes, next wednesday would work, can get some of the speakers to show up. Deb: this time, next wednesday, will send Zoom info. Eric: sounds like it will be useful to have someone wrangling virtual questions. David: yes. A moderator in the chat, Michelle Martineau could be a likely candidate to track the chat room and communicating with us on the Slack channel. For those of you not at Open Source Forum, everyone will be on standard Zoom, will see presenters in the room on the large screen, will ask everyone to mute and communicate through chat. | Naomi: We can have 500 participants on our zoom account | DPEL (Eric): plan to be there in person, if someone else in DPEL TSC who is going to be there in person let me know. Wave: plan to be there as well, can handle Q&amp;A channel. Blog post press release for launch of DPEL goes out the same day, ASC also putting out its press release about STeM 2. Also AWS Noah character, rigged with hair, Intel volumetric cloud library, ALab2 likely at the last minute. Large range of assets on first day. | OpenAssetIO: no one on the call, but announcement of project | R&amp;W WG: Erik: mix of speakers on site and remote, covered if there are issues. First pass of deck is done, will do second pass this week. Tied in with Emily’s team around PR and formation of group, in good shape. | OCIO: Carol: Doug and I will be in person, Thomas will be remote. Survey was posted for comments / questions. Have gotten some responses to prompt in case there aren’t a lot of in person questions. | D&amp;I WG: Carol: are little less ready, but should be fine. Trying to get a couple of people to talk about some topics so it’s not just Rachel and I. Mike Ford in person. Friday celebration of Summer Learning Program has been posted to Slack, Google Drive will have slide decks and resumes. Join us live if you can. | Beers of a Feather: registration required | Private event for the Board, won’t appear on schedule when we publish, right? Deb: no, it won’t. | Keynote with Nick Cannon: Linux for professional workstations | CI + Rust: JF: 20/20 split between Rust and CI, Scott will be onsite, CI will not. JF: will plan to have mostly a presentation to fill 20 minutes in case there aren’t questions | OTIO: Joshua: entirely virtually, intro part, guest presenters will pre-record their segments to stick to schedule. Slightly nervous about not having anyone on prem, would be great to have someone to help, hopefully everything will have been figured out by the second day. | OpenEXR: Kimball will be in the room, Larry as well, everyone else will be remote. Planning a very brief update from Kimball, and then our plan is to seed a discussion with topics, a bit behind in our planning, TSC meeting is tomorrow, so it will be primary topic. David: will you have questions for your community for them to answer? Kimball: have a set of questions to seed. Will figure out a communication strategy to get questions out there: Slack, individual solicitations… Some notes: tolerance for extending file format, new compression schemes that would break backwards compatibility, memory layout issues that were contemplated with iMath, PyEXR project which is in use but unaffiliated with out project and dead, grasping for a strategy to reign it in. | OpenCue: no representatives present | OpenVDB: Ken: will be there in person, unclear if (other person) will be in person or not. 2 part presentation + Q&amp;A. 10 year anniversary at SIGGRAPH, cover the history, the present (version 9), Mathematic bindings, new VDB tool. Future: NVIDIA is making an announcement related to OpenVDB and will be talking about it. | Open #D Engine: Royal O’Brien from LF presenting remotely | Closing Remarks | TAC Meeting (5PM). Deb: can we publish TAC meeting publicly? Kimball: meeting is usually public, don’t need to close it off. Will be hybrid, same setup as the rest of the event but with a separate link. | 2 open sessions: 1 on Monday, 1 on Tuesday, if you know a non ASWF project who would like to present, let us know. | Don’t recall seeing registration for Beers of a Feather? Link in notes. | Naomi: if you can suggest additional projects by Friday, that would be good. Also would need a title + abstracts, need that as well. | Carol: didn’t catch that title + abstract was needed. | . | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Larry: how to get warning controls off in ASWF SonarCloud for OSL, maybe since I’m not admin? Andrew: should be possible to grant policy rights, file a ticket at Linux Foundation Support | Budget Review . | David: not ready for budget review | Larry: probably not a bad thing since we don’t have a lot of people today | John: working on Budget, infrastructure / IT budget, also looking at projects for 2023. Looking to have a finance committee meeting end of Sept, so can present to TAC after that. | David: discussion on Slack budget got us to “living within our means”, will be able to present where we are. Balanced budget, not dipping into our surplus. But will have more detailed update after budget committee meets. | . | David: any other agenda items the TAC would like to discuss today? . | Larry: with SIGGRAPH / OSD are fresh on our mind, any feedback / suggestion for next time while memories are still fresh? | . | SIGGRAPH / OSD summary . | Emily: thought it went pretty well, had more people than we expected on Day 1, smaller on Day 2. We are a lot of newer content on Day 1, less SIGGRAPH conflicts. Beers of a Feather, need to plan for more. | Hybrid style worked out well, people who were virtual were engaged, worked out pretty well, except perhaps for O3DE which was fully recorded. Maybe have more virtual background for next year. Open the floor around scheduling, what if we did it the day before 3D Pro, but how much more time to people want to give up? | Larry: suspect that part of the reason that Tuesday reason was lower may not be due to more conflicts / less popular talks, but after being attentive for the first day, I’ve spent the time I can spend on this and must spend time on SIGGRAPH. Maybe spreading across 2 days is not desirable? There was a lot of content, we would have made tough decisions to fit in a single day. | Wave: if there was a 45 minute version of your talk as a recording, then a 20 minute “quick version” live? I was there the whole first day, but only until 11 the second day due to other commitments. | Videos are on YouTube on the AcademySoftwareFoundation channel, there’s a playlist. Emily to rearrange order to make it clearer. | Larry: thanks to Emily and the LF staff, everything went off smoothly, venue was great, presentations went as well as you could expect for hybrid experience. Loved the venue for Beers of a Feather, people enjoyed the outdoor venue. Made for better conversation than other gatherings since you could drift away a bit and have a good conversation. | Emily: should we explore multiple tracks to fit in a single day. Picking between our content, instead of between us and SIGGRAPH. | Wave: if the videos go up pretty quickly, it’s less problematic to try to “jam in” the content. Larry: cuts are not fatal, everyone of the projects has regular meetings, some don’t have big news or updates. So could give a project update in a TSC meeting. Wave: used the videos as a way to share with others at the company an introduction to the project, what are they doing right now. The MaterialX / OSL was amazing, others were typically status reports. | Emily: we could still do those projects, but record TSCs before hand, but also not sustainable as we grow and get more projects / WGs. Wave: what was valuable was Q&amp;A. Emily: lots of companies do recruitment, what if we made it a “open office” / mentorship day? Could serve a couple of purposes, but a space for people to come in and ask their questions. Michael: many papers and panels have pre-reads before the Q&amp;A session, we could publish videos a week prior, people can watch the content and just show up for Q&amp;A. That seemed to work pretty well, so you don’t have to limit yourself to the time to present. Eric: did you watch a lot of these videos? I saw zero! I have little time before SIGGRAPH to watch videos, so I didn’t think that worked? Michael: since we have more constrained topics, it might give people more opportunities? Could be an option as we scale. | John: because of uncertainties with venue, we put the schedule later than we would have wanted to this year. Schedule came together by us (LF), with other project communities, establish a program community with representation from different people, help vet broader talk, add topics the program committee feels are important, and of course takes off load from David / John / Emily. Different than what we’ve done in the past. Would this be interesting to TAC? | Erik: we could self program, don’t want to lose conversation around “tracks” allowing people to be more judicious about attending parts of the event that make sense to them. Might be easier to put together a committee and figure out what these “connections” / affinities are, allowing us to parallelize. | John: this is where a program committee can help, designing from the ground up, maybe soliciting talks from other folks. Don’t want to over bureaucratize, but this could help to get the right amount of ideas and influences. | David: would be good to get more of the community input into our events, not just OSD but also Open Source Forum in the Spring (likely at Academy Museum), how we balance the two, one meeting in the spring that is more member focussed, and OSD which is more community focussed. We established this at the beginning when we were smaller, but now it’s time to think about next year. Lots of interesting conversations to have, for instance the Academy Museum is a great venue for Open Source Forum, but we could change that. We can take advantage of the menu in other ways, there are larger spaces, so we could have a community-oriented event there. Feels like it’s the time to have a programming committee. Figure out how to work ahead of time. | Emily: perhaps Open Source Forum is where a programming committee could be a good place since we don’t necessarily need project updates, and bring external presenters. Could be a completely different mix, more of a “neutral” ground, not just ASWF projects, but could bring in external projects / presenters. | Doug Walker: having a BoF event has worked well for OCIO, 90 minute in depth session. What should be a balance between a BoF event and a more high level overview. Would it make sense for projects to have two sessions, a more in depth session, and a more 20 minute outward facing? BoF was in person at SIGGRAPH, were able to get a meeting space from Autodesk, had a good session, met new people who hadn’t been involved with the project before. Took the place of a traditional BoF session we used to have before Open Source Days. | Emily: we tried this a few years ago, had a meeting space but only a couple of projects asked for it, and this year no project asked for it. We can help coordinate, don’t know that every project will want to. High Level overview tends to work to keep the most account of people in the room. Doug: would recommend it for other projects, seems good for bringing new people into a project. David: had a last minute session with Moonray, being able to have more ad-hoc meetings seems helpful. | JF: organization for remote presenters seemed to work well. David: it’s more complicated to have mixed on prem and remote attendees, it will definitely keep going (“the way of the future”). One of our action items is how to reach out to SIGGRAPH in a post mortem kind of way and help them evolve their model so we can stay within SIGGRAPH with a hybrid in person / remote model. Need to make it more fluid though, but that’s the way going forward. | Eric: having a breakout session after a talk so you can “hang out in the hall”. Emily: yes, that’s a good idea. Larry: glad we made it easy for remote attendees, the experience in the room with remote presenters was a bit more of a mixed bag, didn’t always have great audio, ask someone else to manipulate the slides, less smooth than someone in person. Wouldn’t want to sit through a day of presentations where most of the presenters are remote. But for an occasional speaker who can’t travel is OK. | Emily: how was the experience as a remote attendee? Larry: were we all there / presenting? Gary: was remote presenter / attendee, as a remote attendee it was excellent, schedule was clear, could dip in and out. Most of the presentations went smoothly, whether in person or remote. Thought it was good. | Emily: did anyone go to anything else that would be worth replicating? Wave: NO! Larry: that’s a good endorsement! Wave: I hoped that some of the workshop / lab things would have examples we could use, but didn’t find anything. | David: anything at SIGGRAPH that was unexpected / inspiring your projects? Or was it all as expected? Larry: was great to hear more details about other projects “in my sphere but don’t have time to attend the TSC meetings”, even MaterialX which I try to keep an eye on. Great to hear what’s going on, a good way to get updated on everything and see the level of excitement about the project. | David: Any in person feature requests? Larry: SIGGRAPH used to be only direct communication channel, now there are many channels, so most people have opportunity to give feedback in multiple ways. So it’s a success. | Emily: was surprised at lack of questions on first day. Maybe it’s gotten too big, people intimidated by room size? So maybe a longer “coffee break” so people can ask questions in less formal setting? Larry: DigiPro is an example of a single track event, but they build in a bit longer breaks so you have time to talk to other people who are there about what you saw together, sometimes that spurs interesting side conversations. Schedule as so pack, we would quickly switch from one project to another. Maybe that’s part of the “hallway thing” we were talking about. Let people regroup? Emily: longer coffee / lunch break. Larry: maybe 15 minute break after every second talk? But that sacrifices time. | JF: could use more guidance about how much Q&amp;A to expect. Emily: prepare some “softball questions” that could be used to seed the room if there are no questions. | David: any feedback about keynote with Steve May / USD? Eric: that seemed to go well. Emily: any topics you would have liked to see from outside our projects, or did you see a talk that would have been good to have at OSD? Would be good to know for Open Source Forum. | David: VES Awards / Sci-Tech awards within a week, so will likely have forum around that time. | Michael: since everyone is there for the conference, maybe a mini “pitch fest”, could make sense to spend 45 minutes for people who might want to be considered for ASWF, 5 minute pitch and see other projects where everyone is present. An “opportunity rich” moment. Larry: that’s a neat idea, a series of 5 minute lightning talks? | Eric: David had good version of this in his intro talk. David: but could be more meaningful if the actual presenters could do a 3 minute “trailer”. Emily: could be interesting to do virtually, a “teaser” released a week before SIGGRAPH / OSD. But also like the idea of the pitch session: new contributors, new ideas. | David: most projects have a vibrant set of presentations and plans for the future, generally speaking, what are the next steps for projects, any changes informed by SIGGRAPH? | Larry: Erik is trying to form a TSC around the R&amp;A project. Erik: two big takeaways: . | Paperwork iterating on legal details of the charter, hoping to wrap up in next day or so | Strategy for thinking what the TSC will be is interesting. Will have WGs focussed on individual project, TSC focussed on strategic output, evolution ot the 3 projects. Asking for volunteers to be considered for initial round of TSC membership, will rotate people in and out based on skills and priorities. What an architecture and platform looks like is first on the agenda as projects work on cleaning up their code. People on TSC should be comfortable with software design and architecture, first pass at trying to get people with the right backgrounds. But also trying to be open a broader diversity of experience in the TSC, reps from the 3 companies contributing code, but they operate mostly in the same sphere, so also looking for people from other communities than “large VFX facilities”. | David: R&amp;A gathered a lot of interest with a new model to gather projects. | Larry: did you get direct feedback from people after the session, since it was the big unveiling? Erik: had lunch with Dave Smith at Spire, that day they were having a conversation with Autodesk with RV issues, so now can commit patches! Heard second hand that some companies have reached out for early access / how to contribute. Need to nudge interested parties sitting on the sideline to dive-in. Some companies had reached out to D-Neg looking to collaborate. Have to wrangle all those people together. David: if you need any help on the broader conversation of open source / ASWF, don’t hesitate to reach out. Erik: any way we can turn onlookers into contributors / members is good! | . | Eric: Any follow ups from exec board? David: yes, from joint TAC / Board strategy meeting, got into it with agenda to dig deeper into how to address Virtual Production. We talked about that, but the conversation got onto additional topic of resourcing / engineering / growing community without our existing companies. Was a learning that we think that it’s as important to grow the knowledge and important of open source in our existing companies as it is to look outside into adjacent topics like Virtual Production. We’ve been looking at what to do to grow within our existing community, what can we do to encourage the growth of software engineers without our companies that work on open source projects. Make it more prevalent and accepted to work on open source projects within our companies, suggestions on doing an open source award that would help highlight the people and the companies that are investing. Strategy meetings don’t necessarily have immediate outcomes, but that put the topic on our radar. A number of releases at SIGGRAPH on VP, OpenVPCal tool from Netflix, also Virtual Production Orchestration tool. Being a known place where companies can come to discuss those is what I have in mind, would be good to have one WG where these tools can be socialized within our foundation. It will happen naturally, it’s a bit early for open source in VP, have asked if people have looked at OpenVPCal, getting reactions that projects used to have in the beginning, “color in a LED video wall is our special sauce”, hearing those things mean we are at the right time, people think that new ways of working are differentiators, but some are not, especially when it’s common infrastructure. That’s a longer term discussion, there is no rush / pressure. These strategy sessions is what we try to do: put a topic that’s adjacent to our day to day activities to stimulate discussion. Will return the question to you, what did you take away from strategy session? | Larry: still digesting… Thought the meeting was very valuable, have to review in my head what conclusions I drew. | . | David: there was a Metaverse Forum update at SIGGRAPH, headed by Neal Stephenson, writer who invented the word. It was an excellent keynote, he has researched the topic deeply, up to NFTs, crypto, he had an hour long speech he had written. The session is recorded, will be available to SIGGRAPH attendees, Metaverse Standard organization is trying to make it publicly available. There was a whole day of presentations, Steve May and Guido presented, Natasha from Unity, each gave their opinion as to what the Metaverse should be. Good observations as to how the Internet started well, but may have been “turning not so good” in the last few years. How does the Metaverse avoid polarization, walled gardens… We are well positioned, the Metaverse Forum puts us in “Standards Organizations” together with SMPTE, IEEE… They now have 1500 companies, a hot topic, and going to present soon some practical efforts on interop. | .

    "content": ". | Scaling Up Projects Presentation (John Mertic) . | Working with projects for quite a bit, systematically if I look across all projects I’ve worked with, a lot of the challenges is once the project is started, have a lot of excitement, lots of initial work, but how do we grow this but not “kill” ourselves. A topical question for a number of the maintainers in ASWF. | What does scaling mean? . | Scaling means a project is able to: . | Build a diverse and vibrant contributor / maintainer base | Enable 100s or 1000s of developers / users | Support a vendor ecosystem of 100s of products | . | How can a project do that? . | Not have to do individual demos? Presentations? | . | Not every project will hit those metrics, but thinking along those metrics lets you think about how you invest your time. Using your time to address valuable goals is important. | In the process of writing a book which will ship in 2023/Q2 on those topics | . | What does diversity mean? . | Multiple organizations committing, no one organization more than 40% of committers | Committers from different races, genders, nationalities, locales | A healthy project is a diverse one. How can a project do this? | Example of Kubernetes contribution, percentage of contributions from Google is declining from 80% to 25%, they didn’t lower their commitment (more engineers), but rest of community was growing at faster pace, so overall share of commits is decreasing. | If Google walked away from the project, it would feel pain, but would no longer be catastrophic. | . | First step is to measure . | Being able to scale means knowing how the project operates. Without data, you don’t know where to begin. | Key data points to consider: . | Rate of contributions | Number and diversity of contributors | Collaboration and engagements in mailing lists, discussion groups, chat channels. This is where potential new contributors first get involved with a project. | . | LFX Insights is a great tool to dig more into this . | Larry (chat): How does it know which contributors are from which companies? Particularly if they are not using their work email for thief GitHub accounts? | Carol: I think it goes by the CLA | Andrew: it’s based upon information on your personal profile. There is a section that allows you to help identify what company you were working for and when | Larry: Profiles on GitHub, or LFX Insights? | Andrew: LF profile. Direct email accounts in LF profile, LinkedIn, GitHub and Gitlab are all used for sourcing this. | . | . | Build an on-ramp for new contributors . | Contributors often aren’t sure how to best engage. Open source projects can feel intimidating to them. | Some ideas to make that on-ramp easier: . | Have a clear, concise contributors guide | Use the ‘good first issue’ tag on issues that are good ones for new contributors to tackle. Encourage projects to spend significant time on this. | Hold regular, open developer community meetings that encourage potential and new contributors to engage the maintainers. | Ensure maintainers are engaging potential contributors in a positive, encouraging way in pull requests, and responding in online forums. | . | . | Mentorships . | Offering paid mentorships helps draw new contributors into the project tackle key issues. Mentorships are also a great onramp for new to industry developers to learn more and explore. | . | Recognize great contributors . | Open source contributors and maintainers often feel underappreciated for the work they do. Additionally, contributors use the work they do in open source as a “portfolio” which helps grown their career: . | Recognize contributors in release notes to formally thank them | Developer a badging program using a tool like credly to let contributors showcase their community status | Give them some swag! Leverage tools like Spreadshop and give them some codes for free merchandise. | Scott (chat); I like the idea of the merit badges. Although, one thing to be careful about is having metrics that make sense. For example, if the goal is to get an accepted PR, someone could make a really low effort PR that is likely going to be accepted, then “free swag time!”. | Andrew (chat): you can see an example of some of the merit badges here (scroll down a bit and look to the right). Badges are custom to the project. | . | . | Communities have a lifecycle too . | Sustainable open source projects aim to train the contributors of today to be the maintainers of tomorrow. With that, you need space for these new maintainers to step in for the maintainers of today. | Preparation for a project for this cycle should include . | Create clear documentation on processes and roles for things like releases, code contributions, and general decision making. | Let new maintainers pair with existing maintainers to mentor them in the role | Make sure current maintainers can step away from the project with minimal negative impacts | . | Trying to lower the “bus factor”: if maintainers step away, how do you continue. Thinking about succession planning. | . | Larry: there’s a tension between having lots of “good first issues” vs having taken care of all these small issues, don’t want to leave a lot of clutter around for people to do? John: every project is a bit different, “good first issues” can be things we would “love to do”. Run into this with organizations that want to open source a code base, but think they have a “lot of work to do before”: if you take that approach, you’ll never get to open source if you wait for it to be “perfect”. In the Linux development process, “release early / release often”, also makes it clearer what you are trying to accomplish. I tend to lean on the side of “don’t be overly self conscious about your code”. | Kimball: some of the larger projects have a tiering of acceptance, your first PR may be in a “scratch” area. John: yes, could be in a feature branch, or work with someone else more experienced. | What are the challenges someone wanting to use the code might have? . | How can I get started quickly? | Where can I find some tips and tricks on common use cases? | How can I showcase my competence (and leverage that to build my career) | . | Getting Started Guides . | Helping developers get up and running quickly is the most important indicator of success . | Make the instructions concise and easy to understand | Use videos to help | Point developers to other resources to help them on the next steps | Look at ONNX project as an example for their Getting Started guide | . | . | Solid documentation . | Good documentation unblocks developers and users to reduce frustration and become productive quickly. | Writing great technical documentation is a unique skill - consider bringing in someone. | HIre a technical writer. A great resource for finding writers is Write The Docs | Leverage a program such as Google Season of Docs | Use a tool like Read the Docs as a framework for making documentation easy to read and navigate | Not everyone is a native English speaker. Consider internationalization for the documentation. | Eric (chat): Is Read The Docs like a Doxygen alternative? | Scott: I think soft ot. But, from what I remember, it was built on the Sphinx Python documentation generator. | Kimball: sorta, it was based on Sphinx, but with Breathe you can actually put some of the doxygen output into there as well | . | . | Outreach . | There are millions of open source projects. Projects need to work to stand out . | Write blog articles on a regular basis that outline development milestones and new feature / functionality | Create videos and share via social media of how to get started, sample use-cases | Present at events that are pertinent to your project | Do meetups and hackathons where potential contributors are. | . | This community is hubed around a few locations, so meetups could work. Also LF has platforms that help to run a meetup program. Great ways to connect with contributors. | . | Training and Certification . | Organizations that want to use your project need to know there is talent out there to help them out. They also need to enable their own staff. | Develop formal training programs that cover the key aspects of using the project | Build a certification program that lets individuals showcase their skills in the technology | . | LF Training is a great partner in developing training and certification programs. | “What should an OpenEXR developer know”? | Start working with OCIO on building a training course. | . | A screen recording of simple “how to” can be a useful video. What are the 4 things someone new to a project needs to know. People just want to know what to do. | Just having a template is not enough, have to have a structure, a “3 act play”, similar to how you need to structure a presentation. John: can get it even tighter / more concise, demo short, specific tasks that someone might want to do. A way to decomplex the situation. A 5 min “quick and dirty” video can be useful, following the lines of “release early, release often”. Would highly encourage to keep in mind what you are trying to achieve, and stick to the UNIX philosophy of small, single function tools”. Erik: Can be harder to do a concise 5 minutes than a 30 minute piece. | Joshua (chat): can we invite a very skilled YouTuber to do some behind the scenes intro / tutorial content with us? | Scott: maybe invite Corridor Digital to talk about some of the tech | Carol: not to promote my company here, but if folks are looking for examples… we do a decent amount of these types of videos, it could be something I could talk about at some point if interested. | JT: In local TV production to make a production easy to put together, we just do answer questions talking head session. It works every time. Decide on key questions then the people answering just do stream of consciousness. This also works for documentation. Just convert the video audio to text and edit. | . | Productization is part of the cycle of a sustainable project . | Successful projects depend on members, developers, standards and infrastructure to develop products that the market will adopt. | Helping define that ecosystem makes it easier to bring products to market and end-users to adopt. | . | Case studies and User Stories . | End-users look to other end-user experiences to help shape their decision making | . | Build a conformance program . | Conformance programs enable the project to showcase an ecosystem of products and services leveraging the project. If also lets project ensure that there is interoperability between vendor solutions which gives end-users choice. | Technical requirements defined by the community | Program is administered by the project staff to ensure non-bias | Vendors get use of exclusive marks and listing in a solution directory with equal footing with other solutions | Projects may choose to provide additional benefits as they make sense for the ecosystem | . | . | Read more on project success . | Case Studios - Linux Foundation | CNCF Project Journey Reports | . | Kimball: something we struggle with is that we have focus on M&amp;E, is that a limiting factor or an advantage? Some of these factors are broader in scope, requires thought. John: we are seeing Waifair and Ikea using ASWF projects, puts pressure on maintainers to support different users. Those are complex conversations, but you have to think about it for the long term direction of the project. Kevin Bjorke: when looking at metrics, are there metrics you see as red flags, “if it doesn’t get to this, it won’t fly”? John: biggest worry is committer diversity, a project typically starts from an organization so you’ll see majority of commits from that org at first, but if you don’t see diversity increase, that will likely be a problem in the future. So that’s one I really pay attention to. Also, on the maintainer side, are we seeing new names come up to lead contributors, or is it the same people on the “top 10 list”, it’s a sign that you are overtaxing your maintainers and not bringing in people who can support them. Early days of a project is a sprint, but then it has to turn into a marathon. Also don’t get too hung up on comparing your project to another. “Velocity” is unique to an industry and project, don’t get too hung up on that. | . | Feedback on annual project review process . | Best practices | How different to status for Board meetings | How different from Open Source Days | Forum for project leads | Want to try to get through backlog of projects for “formal” review | . | DPEL wants to monitor downloads from S3 bucket (Eric) . | Anyone have tools for this? | Everything is currently in same bucket, so how to monitor individual assets | Kimball: know how to get per-bucket metric, but not sure if you can break it up into individual assets | Sean: reach out to me on Slack, I can answer such questions | . | John: review OpenSSF badging requirements . | Can we provide help from foundation | First pass at last CI meeting, most of the way, but have to finish gold and get to silver | Anyone interested can join CI WG at next meeting (next week) | Larry: since that CI meeting, have been going through Silver and Gold for OSL, when I really went line by line, found several line items that I wasn’t sure how to do it, but could not understand how a URL would apply to the line item. So lots of things to discuss. | John: got some guidance from John Wheeler to contribute. | . | . ",

    "title": "Agenda",
    "content": ". | Please remember to add your agenda items to the spreadsheet (Michelle / Kimball): . | https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MgZa3b2PAapAQevGhSjLde7vl-ViGXhyJsC3S8B0ol8/edit#gid=0 | A set agenda ahead of time | . | Request for questions about CII Silver (or Gold) requirements for project graduation (JF): . | The list of requirements: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria | Further background info: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oncI0hbkreAefeidUmbwB_Tl36UNFzI88SbVDe1oKOg/edit#heading=h.agfhwzg33dmj | Kimball: people didn’t know how to fill in some of the security requirement questions. What are you planning to do about it? | Jonathan: one thing we found valuable was looking at how the other projects had answered the questions, provided the best primer, especially if it’s a similar project. If there’s a project that’s close to getting to silver, just finishing up that project and publishing it so other projects can model themselves after it can be a valuable way to approach it. | Nick: don’t intend to relitigate the discussions, but would point out that we’ve covered a bunch of times the Gold requirements are probably not achievable, we threw caution to the wind in OpenEXR to pass the requirement of having a security expert, we don’t actually have security experts in order to exercise the system and get the project fledged. As a responsible participant, I would say that if we took a 3 hour YouTube seminar and got qualified as a “security expert”, that doesn’t fulfill the need from the requirement. So having that as a requirement puts an unachievable bar if we’re going to be responsible about it. So the requirements may not make sense. | Kimball: some of the requirements about encryption / SSL don’t apply to OpenEXR, some of the requirements are N/A to our projects. Maybe N/A doesn’t apply. | Nick: we could “fork” the requirements, “our” Gold standard could be the CII requirements minus specific problematic requirements. | Jonathan: there are no ASWF projects with Silver, the previous requirement was Passing, not silver. | Ken: what prevents us from setting up our own requirements? OpenVDB has been chasing down steganography, could be done in OpenEXR. That’s a legit concern specific to us. What can’t we define our own policy? | Scott: OpenAssetIO may need some of the other requirements such as proper SSL implementation, so we may need to think about what future projects may need to face. | JT (chat): Most ASWF projects, especially the early ones, are actually libraries and not full fledged user facing applications. The standards / CII requirements seem more geared towards the latter. | Erik Strauss (chat): our new Review Initiative will have full fledged end user applications, so it feels like some tiering by type might be necessary. | JT (chat); maybe agree to have an accepted list of specific N/A answers for ASWF projects. Also maybe some questions can be clarified in a similar way or maybe qualified with a context? This is kind of like putting addenda in the document rather than collected in the footer. | Scott: (chat) Would it be worth contacting the group that created the requirements and have a discussion with them to figure out what we can opt out of or etc? (JF comment): the “Further Background Info” document link has comments from the authors, and John Mertic has been going back to the others for clarifications to questions raised by CI WG discussions. | Sean: looking at OpenSSF best practices, there does seem to be room for criteria that are not applicable, as well as “must” vs “should”. Is there a path to Gold that can be met? Even the Musts have ability to opt out. There are criteria that allow the option of opting out, and some that don’t. Are these pathways there for a reason. | Kimball: that’s the ask: if projects have questions about some of the requirements, that’s what CI WG wants to know about. | Sean: is there a process for validating that a requirement is met? JF: was left to TSCs in the past. Kimball: we haven’t had a graduation review recently, so maybe that needs to be part of that process? Sean: would that be the only time this would occur? Kimball: could be done at project review time, a continuing checkpoint. Sean: would be useful for individual TSCs to “preview” an evaluation, would be great if the TAC could put eyes on it, instead of waiting for review time. | Sean: at AWS we have “security guardians” who are consultants who can help projects, does LF have something like that, or should TAC call out certain people as SMEs that can move between teams and help consult on the process, as opposed to everyone having to learn the same lessons. | Kimball: John is not here today, but we should bring it up with him. Andrew/Michelle? Michelle, we do have someone with those resources, but John would know best, so I’ll ask him directly. | . | Tony Micillota: DNeg contributions to OpenVDB? Ken: would it make sense to discuss this on OpenVDB TSC? Every Tuesday at 10AM? Tony: DNeg we had someone who was contributing a lot, but they left, we seem to have a highly customized implementation of OpenVDB, is there a reason it wasn’t merged back in? Curious on how to move forward on that. Ken: yes, the TSC would be the best place to discuss this, and would be great if you have someone you could designate as a TSC member. ASWF calendar for OpenVDB TSC meetings. | Larry: have we covered the CII badge requirements? Kimball: yes. | JF: larger runners are available. Andrew: open a LF ticket to try out, free until end of month. Ken: OpenVDB super excited about it, working very well. Larry: on OSL, recently set up analysis jobs, ordinary jobs are working inside ordinary runners, but analysis builds are long enough that we can’t make it pass of normal builds, have to run them nightly. For that one section, if we had a faster runner, we could make it part of every PR check without a 2 hour delay. | Andrew: we know the cost per minute, the question is what do we anticipate the usage to be. Can we get a feel for how much it would be utilized to get an idea of how much it’s going to cost. For projects using CodeBuild / Jenkins, usually takes 1-2 months to get a good idea of what the cost is going to be in the long run. Until we start getting charged and start getting info from GitHub on usage, while we get the beta for free, we don’t get usage stats. Kimball: Board manages the budget. Andrew: this would come from the Cloud resources budget, but don’t know how much that is, John would have a better idea. Kimball: we can delay this for a bit. | . ",

    "content": ". | Transition to new meeting invite / infrastructure (John) | Welcome to Esteban Papp, new TAC representative for AWS (Sean) . | Esteban Papp to replace Sean as TAC representative, he has volunteered | Has been involved in CI WG | 12 years in industry between entertainment and gaming, 5 years at AWS, was at Dreamworks before | Involved in Primo project, also Luna rigging tools | . | D&amp;I Working Group Project Review (Rachel + Carol) . | D&amp;I Working Group TAC Update slides | What has been done in the last years, lessons learned, discussion topics. Not a ton of slides, keeping it high level to leave room for discussions and questions. If there are questions on specific items, you can ask them during the presentation, but let time for Q&amp;A. | D&amp;I has 3 main focus areas: . | Increase ASWF diversity and representation | Guidance for Members | Student Education | These 3 points are what we use to decide what to focus group activities on, looking at whether an opportunity is right for D&amp;I WG at a high level | . | WG 2022 plan had a lot of items (timeline). Great to have a plan, helped to go into the year with ideas on the table, assigned to quarters. But things change, so want to discuss what changed and why, what the realities are. | Things that happened on time: . | Google Summer of Code Application | Governing Board Succession Plan (wasn’t on the original plan) | Summer Learning Program Organization | Summer Learning Program Execution | . | Things that didn’t happen: . | Google Summer of Code Organization / Execution . | For many reasons | . | . | Things that pushed: . | Ambassador Program | Blog | … | . | ASWF Contributor Demographics . | Didn’t poll this info from this year, info was from earlier in D&amp;I WG | Demographics aren’t at the level of diversity we would want it to be. Was a motivator to find ways to bring more diversity so we better reflect the community we want to reflect. | Worked with the Board to come up with the ASWF Board Succession Plan . | Governing Board was very much behind this | Went to the Board stating we wanted to see more diversity, find ways to have more space within the Board, becoming more open. We have great people on the board, we want them to be there, how do we open up more space | Effort to identity a plan to for what succession on the Board looks like: . | Term limit plan | Process for how the plan phases in | Alternates: every person on the board needs to have a “second” who attends the meetings but doesn’t have voting rights. Opens up opportunities for more people, and hopefully will see benefits over time. | . | . | David: the effort was very successful, triggering the discussion on the Board after initial presentation, we need to do something about lack of diversity. First real action that our organization faced out of the D&amp;I WG that was targeted at members of the Board. As was described, the result of the WG were specific actions that have been taken. Out of 20 Board members, we now have 16 alternates, and we have already rotated 6 Board members, target to rotate 25% of the Board each year to keep consistency / not having everyone rotate at once. At first was a bit worried, had put a lot of time together with this group before the creation of ASWF, a lot of mindshare was developed about goals, the Board we had at the beginning of the year was strongly linked to original group, was worried about losing continuity. Was reassured that this wasn’t going to be an issue, and they were right. We are losing a bit of people with experience who were there at the beginning, but information is being transferred, and new people are coming in with energy that wasn’t there before. They tend to be younger and more diverse, on purpose, and bring more energy. There are more questions to be answered, less to be taken for granted from the past. Want to take advantage of this new energy to take ASWF to the next level. | Rachel: we have other ideas on how we can do similar sorts of things within the organization, how to bring new voices in well thought out ways. | Carol: ASWF D&amp;I Landing Page . | ASWF: Guidance for Members. Redo of landing page. Current is fine, links to webinar series, links to mailing list and Slack. | Project document: ASWF D&amp;I Landing Page | We are now a solid group with recurring activities, we need a stronger landing page. Have input from some great people on the WG, will be working with Emily to make changes to this. Looking for comments, additions. | Want to add things like: . | Calendars | Who we are / what we do | Links to activities | Make it a “home” for the group | . | We are at a point where just word of mouth is no longer enough, need to put resources to make it happen. | Kimball: kickoff to D&amp;I framework? Carol: yes, making progress towards that. Rachel: less about making a pretty page, more about how to collect the information, present it to the community, surface information that can’t be found right now. | . | Summer Learning Program . | Goal of Student Education | Have spoken about it in the TAC several times | Wanted to talk about how it’s going | Summer 202: . | Focus: BIPOC/Latinx (In 2021, focus was women and non-binary people) | 19 Students | More technically focussed (last year was more artistic focus) | At least one job offer! 1 person now employed at Dreamworks, second year in a row we got a job offer. Not necessarily the goal of the program, but a good conclusion. | Combo fo FxPHD &amp; Udemy (last year was Gnomon, more artistic focus), worked well, except a few stumbling blocks with access to the platforms at the right time | Students who are very early in their career | Trying to give them resources so they can contribute | 3 pillars . | Learning : access to online learning platform, no strings attached, free access to these platforms | Mentorship: from ASWF community or outside, weekly meetings, provide career advice | Community . | Community Slack channel just for the participants so they can communicate | . | . | Swag! Very popular | Agree we want to do this again next year | . | . | General Stats . | Group is healthy! . | Monthly meeting attendance typically around 25, not always the same group of people. Some brand new people who haven’t attended ASWF meetings before. Mix of more technical people and people who haven’t had opportunity to contribute since they aren’t developers. | Active Slack channel | Successful second year of the Summer Learning Program, pretty unique to our organization | . | . | Up Next: Initiatives . | Landing Page Redesign | National Science Faire Outreach . | How do we want to engage, based on research by Cary Philips | Looking to engage with younger demographics / high schools, working on how to set up outreach | . | SLP 3.0 - Focus on Neurodiversity . | Starting earlier, wanted to let the TAC be aware of this focus | On top of a lot of people’s minds in our industry, reaching out to a couple of folks we know who have contacts in this area, recognizing that none of us have much experience in this area. | SLP can’t be the same every year, working on what that means. | . | Ambassador Program . | Have been thinking about this for a bit, but will discuss ways for others to contribute in a bit | JT: here’s the doc I’m modifying from one of our local Pasadena docs that is an at-a-glance overview of ASWF projects to assist in quick and easy introductions and onboarding: | John: this feels like the same as https://tac.aswf.io/engagement/ If there are differences - I would love to get them put into that page to make things easier | JT: main difference are the blurbs in the Ambassador doc is at-a-glance style which is a type of lean documentation for onboarding which the engagement page lacks. I was not aware of that engagement page, nice… | . | Possible Hackathon? . | Came out of Open Source Days at SIGGRAPH | Encourage project participation in a more entry level | . | . | Up Next: Function . | Formation of a “TSC” . | May be time for a more formal structure | Bring some of the elements of project structure | . | Developer of key volunteers in the group | Minimize challenges with publishing D&amp;I blog articles - Lean more on RAZ? . | Love the idea of publishing writing around D&amp;I, great way to educate our members and community | Sometimes people don’t feel comfortable around asking questions, or sometimes “don’t know you don’t know” | Have been struggling with getting writing done, since it’s not tied to a key objective, no clear deadlines. Also contributors to the group care about these topics, they may not be comfortable writing in public about it. | RAZ PR is our PR agency, so leverage that. Rachel: we’ve done a couple of articles with RAZ PR, it’s been great, we come up with a topic that’s of interest to our community, someone writes up, and then engage with RAZ. But maybe engage earlier, help collate what we’re trying to get out there from a PR perspective. | David: definitely part of what we are doing with RAZ PR, good time as we start planning for FY 2023, including setting our goals with RAZ. Bring up a couple of pieces we would like to do in collaboration with them. | . | Ways to measure success &amp; accountability . | How do we measure improvement, and how to talk about that, internally and within ASWF. | . | . | TAC Feedback . | Are we focussed in the correct areas? | Where could we help your projects succeed? | Kimball: I think the SLP was great, focus for next year sounds great. How do we just focus on education, but also continuing education? . | Carol: we have talked about it. This is a tough area, we really like the SLP being an intro the industry, no strings attached. We require no experience, no prior knowledge, where that gets tough is that a lot of our projects are not entry level, they are difficult to get onboarded into, SLP doesn’t line up with ongoing impact on our projects. My current thinking is that a better entry to long term growth and our projects may be more along Hackatons, and a program that develops out of that. Getting new contributors onboarded to projects, finding holes in our onboarding documentation is important. We want to eventually have a stepping stone to get from every early beginners (high school), to SLP, and eventually to contributor, and recognize there’s a missing piece between SLP and Contributor. Rachel: had hoped GSoC would have been a piece of that, still trying to find that space. We are finding people from our SLP showing up at TSC meetings, but they don’t have technical skills yet to contribute. Hope is that people getting jobs in our community will soon have opportunities to become contributors, have had a positive association with ASWF, helping them get into the industry. | . | What was the open source framework project that got pushed? Carol: project proposed by Bill Roberts at Adobe, a project different than traditional code project, instead of code, it would be a framework for how to approach D&amp;I at your company. For instance, a small VFX studio, 10 to 20 people, would like to start some D&amp;I initiatives, but can’t hire a D&amp;I person. Want to have a place where you can get started, contributions from member companies. This is a large undertaking, still want to do it, but trying to take more “bite sized” approaches to getting there. | Rachel: have had a lot of people interested in something like that, as well as people saying they have done work internally at their company and would be happy to contribute to something like that. Easier said than done, such as legal aspects. | David: thinking about “TSC” idea, what could be an equivalent to code that other TSCs have. Could it be something that could be turned into a measurable asset, something that’s developed by D&amp;I TSC that’s the “Code” (of conduct), and can be adopted. In terms of measurement, it could be how many external companies adopt the charter or parts of it, and could be very beneficial to our industry to “coagulate” the best practices we are already doing. Perhaps be a bit more intentional about finding the elements that are common to all, and then offering that to anyone openly, just like we offer our code. | Carol: the framework project is a bit more long term, we don’t think the right thing to do for the D&amp;I WG is to become an actual project, there should be some middle ground between the current, temporary informal structure of a WG, and the long term structure of a Project / TSC. Try to figure out what it could look like, how it should be called. WG is meant to be spun up and address a specific issue, once the problem is addressed, the WG should be spun down. Don’t see D&amp;I that way. Naming things is hard, don’t care so much about how it’s named. | Michael: the USD WG is sort of not a TSC that we can graduate into, but an equivalent of a WG that could be the equivalent of a TSC. We have lots of exception cases already. | John: in the WG description, we threw in the concept of a long term WG: Long term working group Initially we wanted to put a limit on scope, eventually there’s a 3 way fork in the road: . | Accomplished goals, shutdown (Python3) | We’ve built a code project, time to become a Project | USD: ongoing piece of work that will continue to happen, there could be an event down the road, but doesn’t have a defined, finite end. | . | John: so designating as a long term WG is an option, we can also go down the path of establishing a formal legal charter, we tend not to do that for a WG, but for something that is meant to be long term, could spin up a LLC for instance, not a lot of overhead, and there are advantages around IP for instance. Rachel: yes, that captures what we do in WGs. | Larry: the CI WG solved the “CI” issue early on, now we are addressing ongoing infrastructure issues, so that’s another precedent of a long term WG. | Rachel: We are co chairs but not experts in D&amp;I, sometimes we need to put together a survey, would like to present more information to our members, right now we search the internet, try to find an expert. Would be great to have a place for all that expertise. | David: you’ve done an amazing job on the D&amp;I WG, TAC is very supportive. You can go ahead and pick the direction you want, if a charter needs to be written / adjusted, that would be a good thing. Thank you! | Carol: eventually Rachel and I will tenure out, and that’s when we know we’ve done our jobs! | . | . | . | ASWF + games industry / GDC . | In USD WG, good response from games community, spun up a new supporting WG with 180 members, great companies coming to present. Games Industry really interested in USD and related projects such as MaterialX | Some members going to a GDC in Canada, question came up, what is ASWF thinking about in Games industry in general. Is this something we want to push on / engage with, something like GDC in March, should ASWF be present at to get more companies involved? . | https://gdconf.com/ | https://gdconf.com/call-for-submissions | Summits submissions open until Oct 7, 2022, midnight | . | David: in general, answer would be yes, want to consider these opportunities. Our mission is to bring tech from the motion picture business, grow them for our own purposes, but also bring them to the broader media industry. We have agreement with Pixar to help with USD in any way we can, even though USD is not an ASWF project. We want to continue this investment in USD, want to consider these opportunities, coming in from our home base of motion picture industry, so definitely part of our mission. | Kimball: tend to agree. | Esteban: could figure out how to collaborate with O3DE Foundation, part of LF, building an open source game engine. David: some interaction, they presented at Open Source Days, and we are presenting at their conference in Austin, Texas in 2 weeks, David will present back after the conference. https://o3d.foundation/ | Esteban: Happy to help in that collaboration if needed, I was part of O3DE and was a co-chair of a SIG | Nick: unfortunately deadline for GDC 2023 is this week | For other groups, could be an opportunity to benefit from USD pushing forward, when we are in those conversations and communities, we can highlight other projects as well. Could be a win-win. David: please bring those presentation opportunities to myself and Emily so we can help schedule and eventually promote it and give it the visibility it needs. | . | Reminder: next CIWG will go over silver level badge in detail | .

    "content": ". | General Updates . | John: move over to LFX PCC Meeting Management after this meeting for meeting management | Go here to register for future meetings: https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/97880950229 | Should have gotten invite for new meeting series, in 2 weeks, should be from meetings@lfx.linuxfoundation.org, reach out to me if you haven’t received it | Will drop a link in the chat to register for meeting | Joshua: should all the projects / wgs use this? John: will work with projects to move over, some work needed in backend management. Have been working with a couple of projects, will be done by end of year. Joshua: DPEL has transitioned, there were a couple of wrinkles, want to figure out a smooth way to do this. Does the new system require everyone to have some kind of LF account? John: it requires a LFX account, but if you’ve registered for any event in last two years, you would have an event. Joshua: will need to explain to everyone attending meeting, that’s a bit of additional friction. | Kimball: we should make sure most meetings have an open / public Zoom, don’t want to discourage people from contributing / attending. TSC / WG meetings should also have open Zoom links. | John: for all these there is a open link, there’s a small step to register for the meeting, and you can use GitHub / Google / … as an IDP. | Matthew: will the ASWF calendar have updated links as well? That’s useful. John: yes, we will update calendar as we move projects over. | Eric: what’s the advantage? John: makes it easier for projects to manage who is attending, avoid zoom bombing, making sure that meetings have a degree of security / management, also able to see the degree of engagement, who is attending and how often. A good way for maintainers to gain engagement. Also integration with LFX suite of tools, https://openprofile.dev has your profile with all my meetings, can also get to recordings from there. Helps to centralize engagement across multiple projects. | Eric: for DPEL we write the attendance in the minutes and prefer minutes to the recordings. John: yes, you can continue to do this. Projects can still opt in / out of recordings. The Individual Dashboard hopefully will help with calendering issues in the past. Eric: that part looks great. If we are posting a public zoom link, then it’s a public meeting. John: zoom bombing doesn’t happen often, but it can be embarrassing. | Cary: we should keep the bar as low as possible for participation in TSC meetings, have never had a zoom bombing issue. Attendance is pretty easy to take in the notes. | Carol: on the user facing side, will we still have separate calendars for projects vs ASWF in general? Currently it’s hard to create and edit events, if we get a better experience, have people be able to sync events to their calendars, that seems like enough of a win to switch over. John: the experience is better, you get a personal invite every time, makes it straightforward. Experience of getting on and off calendars is a lot easier. Aim is that a general calendar will be easier, can pick the ones you want to sign up for. https://openprofile.dev has a My Calendar function, should show everything that should be on my calendar, so have a lot of ways to track what meetings you need to attend. Carol: will need to try it, for the folks who aren’t regular attendees, doesn’t seem to make experience easier? Larry: can be very confusing to find the right login link over all the channels. John: the idea is that even if you are registered for a meeting, you can still hit the public link. It should help, as well as the calendar you can verify in your profile, as well as a secondary calendar for public meetings in general. The public calendar is how we do it today, it’s a bit of a kludgy way to solve the problem. We don’t make a ton of overwhelming difference, but should have a place to get the right link. Still good for leads to announce ahead of a link, makes it as easy as possible to join. | Carol: for now I just use the overall ASWF calendar feed and link that to Google Calendar. John: that should still work. It’s been working well with the Board for that last few months, and lots of other projects are using it successfully. | . | Dependency Matrix (Larry) . | Want to promote and ask for help. Started to mock up spreadsheet, input so far has exceeded expectations. Want to encourage people from projects / vendors / studios to fill out parts that aren’t filled out yet. This is something you want to periodically revisit as your project progresses, also new rows and columns are being added that might not have existed initially. | Lots of interesting data, 2 specific points: . | For any column which is a dependency, interesting to see across all projects who is using which set of versions. In at least one case, this is inspiring me to move minimal versions forward in my projects | Also interesting to see the dependencies of various projects | . | Feel free to circulate this around and contribute, had to turn off anonymous editing since had to revert a mistake. So use a suggestion / comment to suggest a change, or just request edit privileges and I will give you access. | Any questions? Anything else would be useful? | Kimball: not sure where it’s going to go, but a very interesting exercise. Maybe help us guide how we maintain our projects. Not sure how to capture this, but we run into problems with a specific version of a DCC that will use a specific version of PNG, which isn’t on the VFX Platform list, so can run into conflicts. Larry: a good example of where I rely on people as to what should be tracked. If libpng is important to you, you can go ahead and use it. It’s a living document, and it should grow as people feel it’s useful. | Kimball: hopefully helps people who are providing software. | JF: could help identify problematic candidates for VFX Platform inclusion? | Eric: are Rocky / Alma / future Linux platforms on there? Larry: they are supposed to be bug for bug compatible with RHEL8, so that should cover those? That’s the theory, we’ll see if the practice matches. May be worth adding an annotation, which of the many distributions listed here is the one people will coalesce on. We all know that our projects are not just used in the VFX Platform environment, so that’s not the boundary of our concerns of what we have to maintain for and what our users expect. | Kimball: we are also capturing versions installed on base systems. Thank you for putting this together! | Cary: looks for old numbers of OpenEXR, looking for projects that need help moving forward. You can get this information this here, but a lot of the entries are things like Maya 2019, a dependency that’s not going to change. How can the information be presented to separate: . | I’m a project maintainer, how can I help move everyone forward | I’m a developer, how do I manage the web of dependencies | . | Gordon: could be interesting to track targeted VFX Platform versions and see where projects deviate | Carol: have we shown this to anyone specifically? Larry: posted link to VFX Platform mailing list, got a lot of updates directly after that, so people involved would know about this. Carol: this is a great, maybe the VFX Platform should maintain this? Larry: they have resisted this, try to have a narrow focus, the platform is supposed to focus on problematic packages, also they publish a list for each year. As a package maintainer / studio representative, there’s a lot more info, and this spreadsheet may help to surface it. Carol: should be made aware at VFX Platform level, make sure it’s known how useful it is. | Kimball: we’ll keep capturing the data, and will likely have VFX Platform coming to join a TAC meeting soon? | Chat: Scott: I sort of want to take this and throw it in a db. Kimball: but that would involve making a web page to browse and edit. Eric: Who’s going to set up autogenerated dependency graph? | . | CIWG -&gt; IWG: fate of utility projects? (Larry) . | Origin is Tom Cowland communicating about the idea of a file abstraction layer, such a class exists in OpenImageIO, maybe we should cleave this off and make it a tiny dependency that other projects can use. I’m supporting this, but where should such things live? In one of the existing projects seems like the wrong place if it’s going to be shared. So it could be a ASWF project, but that has too much overhead, so maybe the solution is just a small repo, shudder at the idea of putting that under ASWF needing more calendars, TSCs, CLAs, meetings… That seems crazy. But at some point we may have 10-20 small projects that shouldn’t be “full” projects. Since these are common pieces of infrastructure, maybe the CI WG could be the right home for this? The CI WG is mostly no longer about CI per se, the idea I want to float is that the CI WG can morph into the “Common Infrastructure” group and can be the home for common pieces of infrastructure. It also feels like the right people around the table, what do we want for the future of the CI WG? Does it make sense to grow into that direction? Is it still a WG if it’s doing this? This has been swirling around, and wanted to get this discussion in the open. | Kimball: I’ve been trawling through our pile of code, over the years I’ve found 10 or 12 different takes of using a logging system, they all have different features and strengths, have been collating this into an abstraction. There’s an example with iMath getting split off from OpenEXR, without having the full weight of a project. | Chris: we are talking about IOProxy? Larry: yes, but it’s just an example. Chris: if there’s something that all projects want to share and is clearly defined, that’s good. But something like IOProxy may be a small, well defined thing, but as it gets used, it will get added to, and changing something at the root of the dependency graph may be problematic and create more “versionitis”. So we want to be careful with this. The way IOProxy is done in OIIO is good, it’s tied to what OIIO, but if it gets extended, could become a maintenance problem. Just because it’s a small library, the decisions still need to be taken carefully. | Larry: noted, we have discussed that, how do we prevent scope creep from making this an impossible project. Kimball: having common error reporting from projects could be an interesting thing. Chris: lots of possibilities we could use, but it becomes a dependency you have to add to every project. Most projects decide to roll their own, “info/warning/error”, next thing you know, every library you integrate has their own. | Chris: we may want to wait until we have more than one project? | JF: Aswf-docker is an example of an existing, common dependency. | Kimball: does the CI WG want to change its charter? Larry: it does imply that the WG is an ongoing concern and that it owns code. It wasn’t in the initial conception of what a WG is. Kimball: we have example of D&amp;I WG as a long running WG. Larry: on the day we created CI WG, we would be done when we figured out a CI pipeline. | Kimball: not doing review until next year, maybe if we want to keep moving forward we could move this up? Larry: not a deadline associated with this, just the conversations were happening. | Kimball: we are going through an internal process to collect various small “bits” and refactor them. | Chat: Scott: Side note: I’m really excited about the idea of IOProxy. I see it as something that could be used for dealing with caching network data locally among other things. Eric: IOProxy is here: https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/blob/master/src/include/OpenImageIO/filesystem.h | . | Follow up: USD @ GDC (Alexander) . | Thanks to input, Emily submitted a proposal for a 60m presentation at GDC for USD in games, we should hear back from them end of November, if we get accepted, do we want to use this to do marketing for other AWSF projects, it would be an ASWF presentation. Also do socializing around the event. | . | DCC API archive considerations [Michael Min] . | Looking at software for asset archiving. Is there a common repo from DCC providers for APIs. We are dealing with almost every permutation of software, someone was asking if there’s a consideration to archive APIs for future reference, in case you need to rebuild assets around these DCCs. Not aware of any. | Eric: would this be a document? An executable? Michael: from his perspective, the API referencing a particular build of Nuke for instance. More of a general question. Kimball: that’s sort of why the Academy did the ACES specific to have an ACES EXR subset for archival requirements. Git history provides a record, but this is something different? Michael: this is products who may or may not have published. | . | . ",

OpenVDB was scheduled this week, but pushed back to next meeting, which had ripple effect. If anyone is “more ready” to present, you can asked to be bumped up in the list. Kimble: OpenEXR hasn’t really started working on its presentation yet. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MgZa3b2PAapAQevGhSjLde7vl-ViGXhyJsC3S8B0ol8/edit#gid=0 | John: don’t over think it! Joshua: planning OTIO presentation, overview of how the project is going, here are concrete requests of the TAC membership on how to help. Should we formally ask to move from incubated to adopted level? Does that project need to be tied to project review? John: it can be, or it can be done separately. If you think you are ready at the time, would make sense to do it, but doesn’t have to be. Also happy to review any slides if you want. | Kimball: graduation doesn’t need to be tied to project review, unless you are ready for it. | . | Potential Hackathon for 2023 . | John: a way to help drive some interest in the project, would it make sense to run some form of a hackathon? These things can go a lot of different ways, what has been success / feedback around hackathons, has your project done them, have they been a success / disaster? Would your project lean well towards doing one of these? Trying to gather data points. Likely each project would need to decide what it would look like for themselves. | Larry: 2 sets of questions, the ones you just addressed, it’s hard, the project need to do a lot of work, a list of tasks that can be done by new people in a day. Also can the companies we work with make it so a wide swath of people can contribute to the projects, get cleared in advance, without knowing in advance what they are going to work on. Could be difficult in a number of organizations. But trying to make this possible could be a reason to run a hackathon. CLA could be one of many hurdles, depends a lot on the organization. Some organizations haven’t contributed to a particular project, degree of difficult varies between organizations. Not a reason not to do it, in fact could be a reason TO do it. | Kimball: asking organizations to add a lot of people to ASWF projects via EasyCLA. It can take some time. | John: if a project wanted to set aside a “hackathon”, is that something that would be generally accepted that someone could step away for a day to do something like this? Kimball: depends on when that period of time is, in my case, it could be acceptable, but depends on when. On the eve of a big film release / delivery, that could be an issue. Would companies have an issue if it’s a constrained set of projects, only ASWF projects for instance? Larry: any project I’ve gotten through the clearance at all, I can decide afterwards who can contribute what, but can anyone in the company contribute to a project that no one has contributed to before? Would require some process… Even with the CLAs signed, sometimes every patch has to be reviewed. For me, the project is “a new project”, and it took a while to get this process streamlined. | John: if we give enough lead time, and if we have interested organizations, we could seed it. Larry: if we plan this for summer time, it should be possible to make it work. Kimball: what about member vendors, would that be possible? Gordon: have tried lots of hackathons at different scale / levels, have tried different levels of engagement, challenges based on timezones, personalities… Need organization and coordination, some people can self organize, others want more structure. Don’t know how much a hackathon would change velocity of a project. Maybe across the teams there are a few things here and there that would work? Top level guess is that people are just doing it, we have engagement across several projects, it’s just happening. Would have to poll some of the things to get more info. | Joshua: could take various libraries and tech and add support in other projects for these libraries. Either a commercial product or an open source project, for instance “add OCIO support to a product / project”, doesn’t require CLA. Gordon: I really like this angle, “do something cool” with the projects. Could get a bunch of sample code / demos / integrations. That could be fun. | Kimball: is there something we can do with Open Review Initiative to glue 2 or more projects together, but this can be more general. | Gordon: is there a case study of another community that’s done this, how did it get organized, how successful it was. John: lots of communities have run successful hackathons, but hard to find parallel datapoint, it can done in so many ways. Would be more interesting if it had been done in this industry, and don’t know of anything specific. There’s the technology / code aspect, but also the culture component. Would be curious if there’s been precedents in this industry. | Kimball: don’t know anything in this industry. Individual companies do some internally. If you look back 20/25 years, some activities around switching from IRIX to Linux. | John: sounds like there’s interest, there may be a long path towards integrating in schedule and legal aspects. Also look not only at contributions to projects, but also integration into other projects / connectors to ASWF projects. | . | Discussion | . ",

    "content": ". | Updates . | Kimball: Hackathon Followup: discussion at the Governing Board yesterday, there’s a request to try to pull in more people to form a working group. | Larry: was talking to John Mertic, we were noting that it’s nice for projects to be able to document what films they are working on, but it’s really hard for maintainers to know this. So if you are at an organization that is a user of these projects, it’s really nice to contact the maintainers and share which movies a project is used on. It’s useful for morale and recruitment. Even if only once a year, sending the list to the project maintainers, would be greatly appreciated! John: project could capture this in a file, could be used for PR, getting “implicit” signoff mechanism in case there’s sensitivity around it. Larry: it’s in the README for OSL, so in theory anyone can make a PR, in practice I’m the one maintaining it, and don’t really get notified. If I know a studio uses it for everything, I can track the projects done by that studio. | . | OTIO Project Review (Josh) . | It’s been a while since OTIO has done a project review | Outline . | Project lifecycle: incubation -&gt; adoption | Highlights: . | Studio &amp; vendor adoption | New features | . | Plans &amp; Challenges . | ASWF collaboration | TSC expansion | Requests for the TAC | . | . | ASWF Project Lifecycle . | Transferred OpenTimelineIO trademark to ASWF | Switch from “Modified Apache License” to Apache 2.0 | Switched to ASWF CLA | Moved GitHub repo to ASWF org | Enabled DCO &amp; EasyCLA enforcement | Approved the OTIO TSC Charter . | All the “paperwork” that needed to happen, had no idea how long it would take to sort out | Once this got sorted out, it’s working pretty smoothly, have had people reach out asking how DCO / CLA works.

So far the design of secure software is not something that our primary developers have expertise or much interest in. Even a week of training would not be enough to call ourselves “experts” in security. To our knowledge, only OpenEXR has tried to do this in earnest and took a lot of effort from Apple and others to make it happen. For OTIO either some company / individual would need to step forward and fill that role, or will languish and not get addressed indefinitely. How do we address this impasse? | . | . | . | Time for Q&amp;A . | Larry: you were wondering whether not being at a 1.0 release is hurting adoption, is there something you feel is missing to be at 1.0? Joshua: not being perfectionist, we have achieved most of our 1.0 milestones, but documentation / developer onboarding is still missing for a 1.0 version. We can do a bit more there and call it 1.0 and go from there. There aren’t blockers, except the time to do this work. Eric Reinecke (chat): Josh can contextualize, but we use this GitHub project board to track our 1.0 roadmap | Carol: dealing with integration with vendors. Wanted to encourage you that you are not alone in this situation, the approach that OCIO has adopted is to meet vendors where they are at. If they want a separate meeting, we do that, even if it’s annoying. Recently for the camera vendors for the configs WG to make sure the right IDTs were incorporated. Sometimes vendors don’t want to announce intention to support features until they are far along the development process. OCIO TSC sometimes divides up based on links with companies, and have some separate meetings. Happy to discuss this directly, how we handle this, and how we create connections with vendors. Joshua: we had initial meeting about RV support, how do we get some of the other vendors to get to this step. We had a vendor ask for specific technical information, they offered to give specific technical documentation under NDA to a specific ASWF member company, which doesn’t really help. We need to find a way for these other companies to be able to talk to use as a community. They are usually set up to talk to other companies, but not communities. Can a ASWF TSC member sign an NDA in the context of the OTIO TSC for instance? Probably not. John: it can be difficult. It can be good not to incorporate internal information. Can do research on how other projects handle this. Carol/Josh are dealing with this in the correct way, sometimes companies will just go off and build things on their own. 80% of the certified k8s vendor list have never contributed directly to the project itself. May want to think how to formalize the process over time to avoid having to repeat information from meeting to meeting, having some documentation in place. Can help with this process, not to get crushed by this load. Josh: we can point people to Open Source Days presentation, they already know what OTIO is, but may have an outdated perception from 2 years ago. Better documentation would help as well. If there are folks who already have influence at those companies. It would be great if they could ask about the state of OTIO projects, point to OTIO TSC and encourage engagement. David: you had 4 names, Avid/Adobe/Apple/Black Magic, two of these are ASWF members. Josh: sometimes the people we know aren’t in the right group / in charge of the right product. David: you can ask Wave to help at Apple. For Avid and BMD, they are not ASWF members, we’ve been trying to get them to become members for a long time. What could be helpful with them, “who will take up the cause of open source and OTIO within the company”, identifying this person is key. Having an overview of OTIO to present to them as if they didn’t know anything would be helpful. I imagine that’s either already existing, or wouldn’t be too difficult to put together? You were mentioning in terms of having difficulty engaging with them, do you have other examples that you would see gravitating around the project but not engaging? Joshua: those are the ones we get the most frequent requests about. There are also requests around game engines, Epic / Unity have already engaged with us, as are Autodesk and Foundry, but it’s more the NLE / broadcast companies that are less engaged. More used to working with end users that don’t have software developers, and not providing SDKs. David: we will get them in the end! JT (chat): what Carol just said on waiting until almost ready to release to announce and hesitant to make known early interest. I’ve seen this a lot as a freelance consultant. Larry (chat): Need to normalize vendors showing up to TSC meetings even for projects they don’t use, so their presence doesn’t give away any useful secret information about what they are planning to use. | Cary: the security course offered by the LF https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/secure-software-development-requirements-design-and-reuse-lfd104/, got as far as looking at the web page, seems like a fairly minimal commitment, a few hours time. Planning to take it when I can carve out time. Probably a lot of things that don’t apply to OpenEXR, but the knowledge we are supposed to have is to be able to segment what we know we don’t have to deal with as opposed to what applies to our projects. Assuming that taking this course will satisfy this badge requirement? John: yes, that’s one of the intentions of it. As a CS grad, was taught programming, C++, functional languages… but didn’t teach anything about secure programming. Starting to get into more curriculums, but being able to build software securely starts at the beginning, not added after the fact. If you look at the badge, the intention is to have people in the project who can think this way. Doesn’t mean that we need to be at the level of dedicated security researchers, but have people who can look at PR code reviews, think about where buffer overflows can happen… This is what the course focuses on. Doesn’t mean that just because you have security conscious developers, that you shouldn’t use checking tools. Doesn’t necessarily mean you have a high level / dedicated security researcher on the team. Joshua: how secure / against which adversary, we can take the course and make an outline of what applies and doesn’t apply to OTIO. So we have a “story” of why we have a Python API, some things are “insecure by design” to handle production pipeline needs, as opposed to OpenEXR being incorporated in OSes. We thought the commitment was a full week, but if it’s just a few hours and help us make a better choice… John: there’s a requirement for the project to document how it thinks about security, as opposed to what we’re not handling. It takes some of the onus off the project from having to handle every single handle, instead define the scope of what the project is taking care of, as opposed to what’s left to the user to handle. Larry: we can’t predict how these projects end up, as small in house project can turn up years later to be embedded in an OS. So we don’t have the ability to be confident that some things don’t become relevant later on. Also most of our projects don’t have anything to do with logins / passwords / accounts / PII, so it’s mostly about buffer overflows. These things that get caught also reflect inability to handle a corrupted input file, so fixing those issues generally increases the quality of the software, and is worth chasing down and fixing. Joshua: so can we fullfil that badge by doing diligence against buffer overflows, and clearly labelling the software, here are our thoughts about security, here are “holes”, maybe a recommendation of “please don’t put this in your OS since we know about limitations”? Larry: can go a long way by making sure your CI suite has a good static and dynamic analysis, have sanitizers turned on. Fuzzing on input files catches a lot of what would bring you down based on bad input. OpenEXR is an example of a project that a lot of stuff was caught because of the Google Fuzzing project, they were all legit problems. Cary: when we were first invited to joining OSS Fuzz, were leery of it, but it turned out to be positive. Uncovered flurry of things at first, but now has slowed down. Maybe half dozen this year, came with reproduction case. They approached use, but you could approach them, they cover thousands of projects. The hook you put in their project is simple, takes a bit to figure out what you need to do, but we can help explain. Ken: there’s another security hazard is often overlooked, especially when projects are file formats, is steganography. We looked at this in OpenVDB, we uncovered ways of doing this in OpenVDB. I imagine you could do that as well in OpenEXR. Larry: what was rationale for handling this? Ken: can smuggle information, lots of blind data that can be embedded, could be a mechanism for importing viruses. Kimball: sometimes the project can’t do this, and it has to be put on the end user. Ken: not claiming we patched it, but we documented it, allowing users to look for additional / hidden data. Cary: transparency is important, letting the user know what they are getting. Joshua: thank you, that really helps us out. JT (chat): Can LF in its partnership have one of their security experts do “audits” with a coding recommendations report as outcome to guide project developers? | Kimball: Thank you Josh! | . | . | John: elections . | It is election season, industry representatives, JF + Daniel, would like to redo this election here in the coming weeks. Can send a proposed timeline, identifying the existing representatives, whether they want to continue. Also do we want to identify other industry representatives as voting TAC members. Can also revisit on Nov 30 meeting. Kimball: how are we doing these elections for TAC chair + industry representatives? John: want to reach out to both industry representatives to see if they are interested in continuing, can be done as a vote at TAC meeting. For additional representatives, if someone wants to nominate someone, can send to TAC email list, we can have 3 industry representatives total. Does that sound reasonable? | John: on the TAC Chair side, want to do a similar process. Kimball has been our chair for a while, if he wants to keep doing it, or if someone else is interested in doing this, can drop an email. If we don’t have anyone else present themselves and Kimball still wants to do it. Kimball: would be happy to have someone else do it, don’t want to be the BDFL! John: similar situation in every project I work with. | . | John: a project proposal went to TAC mailing list, open source 3D Atlas of Anatomy project, haven’t invited them to a meeting yet, not sure if they aligned with this group. Anyone agree / disagree? Doesn’t seem like it’s very related to this domain? TAC mailing list post . | Larry: doesn’t seem to fit? Or maybe a DPEL asset? If it’s production quality. Kimball: it would make most sense as a DPEL asset. But doesn’t seem like the data is oriented towards these applications, although anatomically correct rigging data in the repo could be useful. Could ask DPEL group if they are interested in talking to them? And they can make the call. | . | John: there was an ask to Board on a presentation on the budget. We are working on closing the bridge, so didn’t want to present until 2023 budget is approved by the board, at which point we will present to the TAC. It’s coming, but delayed until adoption of 2023 budget. | John: we have a bunch of projects on LFX Security, but not getting scans done. Some of the projects are lacking the right metadata, asking each project lead to take a look and figure out why your project is not being scanned. If you need help, can get help on this from the team. Scott: would it make sense to have a WG to look at security in the ASWF, gather a wiki of all the information on best practices from the projects, or do we leave it to every project, but have a central repository. John: source like a good idea, could have a specific WG, or could be in scope of CI WG. Kimball: if you want to propose a charter, it wouldn’t need to be open ended. Scott: will try writing something, and see if someone is interested in chairing this. Larry (chat): Perhaps we should set up a Wiki so projects with any experience can help craft a “best practices” or list of steps they take to help beef up security. Like, OpenEXR can write how the fuzzing works and how we respond to CVEs, etc. Just so everybody doesn’t need to start from zero the first time these pop up on their projects. Stephen Mackenzie (chat): rez has kind of a similar “security” burden/issue. The entire point of it is to execute the code the user arbitrarily wants to execute in the environment they want to - If your rez package repository is compromised, you already have far worse problems. (But there are always things we can do better, or say, to facilitate newer versions of python being used for so their security updates can take effect, or whatever). I also think as many of our projects are providing file formats for files that may be flowing across air gaps, it’s extra important that we aren’t threat vectors. | . ",

    "content": ". | Scott: there is a Slack channel to talk about Security WG, haven’t had a chance to talk details yet, but if anyone wants to start posting ideas, we can create a proposal before end of year / early next year. #wg-security | Virtual Production Interest Group (David) . | Throughout last year did a number of strategy meetings, including the one with the TAC, when polling ourselves about areas adjacent to our core knowledge that we could expand into, a series of topics gravitated to the top. Some about interactive software, gaming, and also virtual production. Taken together, looking at next year, we want to follow up on these “holes” to create a WG on virtual production as a potential action for 2023. But that’s out of surveys, real way to do a working group is that it has to come from TAC and TAC members. That’s why we bring this interest to the TAC, see if there’s interest from the TAC to look into that. At this point it qualifies as a “hot topic”, try to build a proposal for what this WG would look like. So a “test for interest” / request for proposal from the TAC. We can have it now or later in the agenda. | Kimball: we will do this later in the agenda. | . | Kimball: still plan to present budget to TAC? John: probably early in January, still working on getting budget approved, won’t get wrapped until governing board meeting on Dec 14. Looking on how to break out funding for different areas, including GitHub runners. | John: elections for TAC. JF has indicated interest in continuing as Industry Representative, spoke with Daniel if he’s interested. Daniel: I have not been active contributor over the last year, so won’t be seeking to be reinstated as industry rep, but will be able to start contributing again early next year. John: need to renew JF as industry representative. TAC can add representatives at any time, but want to renew once a year. Kimball: motion to renew JF, Wave: second. All yes, motion approved. And thank you Daniel for everything you have done, and looking forward to seeing you around next year. | John: haven’t heard any expression of interest for TAC chair, we can wait until next meeting. If anyone has interest in that role, reach out to me. We can have vote at next meeting. | OpenVDB Annual Review (Ken) . | Highlight of last year was release of version 10 on Oct 1st 2022, for 10th year . | Mathematica bindings | New tool that exposes all the functionality in the project via command line tools. So everything you can do in Houdini, you can do with command line. | . | Asked TAC for help with CI build. OpenVDB is a very large project, build times were very long and painful. Had done a lot to try to minimize, but biggest improvement was change to GitHub Actions build machines. A bit worried about what happens once the early access period is over (today!), hope it can continue. | Working on reducing number of dependencies. A complaint from new adopters is number of dependencies. We are almost done with TBB and Boost which will be optional in the future. Also transitioning away from Boost::Python bindings to pybind, and adding more Python bindings options to our tools. | Had presentation earlier this week: bunch of improvements from SideFX related to improving the tools that take polygon meshes and produce level sets. Existing technique has issues with structure inside a surface, it gets removed, which used to be thought of as a feature, but could now be desired. | Talking to Autodesk Bifrost team, working on a port of their multi grid and hope to evaluate and adopt this year. | Expanded the TSC group itself, the person who is responsible for the Mathematica bindings has joined TSC. | Kimball: sounds like you are having increased contributions not just Ken. Ken: yes, lots of external contributions. | Joshua: how many people on your TSC, and how did you pick? Ken: project is “old” (10 years), initially had a developer from each company, but that’s no longer the case. Right now have 2 people from NVIDIA, 2 from ILM, WETA, then someone from outside entertainment who is using OpenVDB for medical applications (Mathematica as a DCC). Project seems to have caught a second wind a couple of years ago, the number of contributions seems to have grown. | David: in terms of future adoption of OpenVDB, is there something ASWF can do to help grow adoption? Ken: feels like we are saturated in M&amp;E, what we are seeing is that it’s growing into medial, HPC. Being used a national labs, machine learning applications. So I don’t know, but a request from another presentation: it’s hard to get an idea of what the product is used for, even within this industry. Have very few anecdotal evidence, we know it’s in Houdini, would be good if there was more insight on how it’s being used. Even feature requests can be tricky: feels like people are contributing “random” features they are working on, rather than a structured list. David: we can think of a survey. Will talk to Emily. You also said about OpenVDB being used in other industries is a great story. We don’t necessarily want to go out and promote our projects in other industries, but it can be good to “put out there”. We make our technologies better for the Motion Picture industry, but also make them available for other industries. Ken: it’s ironic that for a long time, the project was suffering from the association with “Hollywood”: people would hear about this new way of representing volumes, but would be reluctant to use it for scientific or engineering applications. But we seem to be past that now. | Eric: someone might use it through Houdini and not know… Ken: specifically you would know since the Houdini node is called “VDB”, but a lot of tools use VDB internally. Larry: you’ll catch it from the large file size! People are probably not ignorant that OpenVDB is an important part of their pipeline. Kimball: we also use it in Nuke. | Ken: very happy with support we got on CI build. One of the big problems we had was that sometimes we couldn’t reproduce issues since we couldn’t reproduce a build (some specific Windows configurations for instance). We may be able to throttle back if needed, but it’s been a game changer. | John: a number of these projects are used “behind the firewall”, so even if you had telemetry (which you don’t want), would have skewed stats. A lot of LF projects are looking for an understanding of who is using the project and how it’s being used. Talk to OTIO about this as well, maybe set up a “ADOPTERS” file in repo so people could “self declare”? More of a push model than a push model, people would volunteer that information. Can also do case studies. But more generally a difficult problem. | Ken: our best tracker is the forum, can guess who is using and what they are using it for. John: that’s a standard path in open source. Ken: another indicator that the project is healthy is that the discussion forum has taken its own life. Used to have to sift through all the posts and answer all the questions, we don’t have the time to do that anymore since others have already done that. Some people we don’t even know have a deep insight. | Ken: a lot of work going on at NVIDIA on this project. NanoVDB is a GPU friendly subset. Currently only a static topology can be manipulated but working on ways to generate grids on GPU. Also NeuroVDB, presented at SIGGRAPH, being open sourced for evaluation from NVIDIA, and hoping it can be contributed back. A lossy way to represent volumes, but can control the quantization / errors. Can reduce footprint by 10x to 100x. | Joshua: having an ADOPTERS file: some things happen naturally as part of Open Source Days, the “sizzle read” shows that a studio is using. For OTIO was going to collect those and add them to the ADOPTERS file, but feel “anxious” about just adding names of studios I know are using it. Do we need guidance as to what’s OK to add to ADOPTERS? Putting a PR to a ADOPTERS file can be a high burden. Larry: you can ask people to contact you and you can add it so that people don’t have to go through CLA process. I can be reluctant to add these things unless I’m super sure. Just because someone downloaded a project doesn’t meant they are “officially” using it on a project. That has to come from someone who knows because they were involved with a production. | Stephen Mackenzie (chat): could create a GitHub issue template. Andrew: can add one at top level of ASWF. Kimball: can add to Kimball “if you are using it, create an issue”. Joshua: can also fit into yearly surveys, can help to show reach of ASWF. Carol: not sure if we can get it to the granularity of what movies a project is used on. Maybe a studio can say “this was the first film we used project X on”, but for something like VDB or OCIO, it will be used on every project at a studio, so in theory you could theoretically list every project from a studio from IMDB, but that’s not necessarily what you want. | John: can also be awkward if a project is associated with a movie that has bad connotations? Larry: anyone working on movies as a career have stopped worrying about individual movies! | Emily: as we start working on the Sizzle Reel, we can ask for that, which projects were used. OpenEXR / OCIO / OpenVDB is on every movie. John: could be most useful to have useful long tail of every movie out there, but for the benefit of the project, what are the top 10 movies of the year. Larry: good time to promote project is around Academy Awards nominations come out, can promote as a blog post. “Used on 4 out of 5 nominations”. Emily: sometimes very hard to figure out which projects were used on each film. Have tried to get this info from the community, but people can be reluctant to divulge. Need to find the right contact info, need to be pointed in the right direction. John: so maybe focus on a certain set of films, the ones that are nominated for awards. Carol: the more targeted you can be with an ask to a studio, the more success you will have. Asking for a specific title that’s already been put up for awards, a lot of studios that were submitted for a VES award will have already put together promo materials that have been cleared. Much easier to have access to this info, rather than more open ended questions. Emily: if we know what movies something was used on, those can be specific questions to a PR person. Would love to get is our projects being USED on a film. The breakdowns typically don’t show that. Maybe even a screenshot? Kimball: maybe add overlays to show which projects used on what “parts” of a shot. Larry: needs someone to go in there and do it. A lot of PR channels would not know this information. Sean McDuffee: can also leverage approvals from DCC vendors. Emily: yes we leverage that. | Larry: a lot of studios have updated the VFX build matrix spreadsheet | Kimball: any security related issues from non-entertainment users would be interesting to send to #wg-security. Ken: we don’t have security experts, so… | . | Robin: presented a couple of projects to TAC mailing list . | Became project manager for Cinepaint, one of the first things done was port to Windows, did so much porting work than created libunistd, we’d rather be programming UNIX-style, but would like to support Windows. Wouldn’t be great if you could include unistd.h and would still build and work on Windows without needing WSL. This library has been around for a while, used by multiple projects, but haven’t mentioned it yet. A bit of a hodge podge, have almost everything but fork(), most of the same APIs as on Linux/POSIX. | Cmaker is a bash script that generates CMakeLists.txt, cmaker_project.sh Then there’s cmaker_class.sh to create individual .ccp, .h and ctest files for each class. Then cmaker_project.sh creates the main executable. Then can run cmake on the resulting project, and for instance build the result with Visual Studio. | Can then run ctest on the resulting classes. | Larry: this is super cool, do exactly what you say, want to propagate structure of a project, can get really complicated. How much of what goes into class files, CMakefiles is templated, or is it hard coded? How easily can this be shaped into everyone’s favorite idioms? Robin: easily, since I chance it all the time. Larry: can you send GitHub link? Robin: it’s in GitLab, you can find it on there. | There’s a template file, cmaker_project.sh.txt | Kimball: for libunistd, why have that vs using mingw? Robin: it’s a lot lighter, not saying you have to use it, just wanted to make it known. Kimball: was wondering if you felt a need to develop this? Robin: back when I did this a while ago, it was difficult to pick the parts of mingw you wanted without the parts you don’t want. Kimball: mingw seems to have gone more towards supporting cross compiling. Robin: libunistd is also headers only. Make everything in unistd.h work as expected on Windows. Some of the stuff is stubbed out if hadn’t needed it before, so not everything is implemented yet. | Both are easy to find: libunistd on GitHub, Cmaker on GitLab | . | . ",

Links take to NIST page that lists description of vulnerability as well as information we provided. When a CVE is made public, go to this page to submit additional info, link to the source of the bug, link to the release notes that describe the fix, and place to download new version. Dealing with this is straightforward | Most issues we’ve dealt with have come from OSS Fuzz project. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=41416 | We have a chunk of code that reads a file in its entirety, the google servers run this on a random set of bits. Reproducing issues has been pretty easy. | Scott: OSSFuzz supports a bunch of fuzzing engines: https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz | . | Roadmap: 2023 . | ABI compatibility: C-level base types . | OpenEXR puts the entire library in a namespace based on the minor release, making it possible to link 2 versions of the library in the same process. But complicates the release process, since it puts a fine point on a minor vs patch release. | Maintain ABI compatibility between releases. Major shuffling in the works is to retrofit the existing C++ ABI to use the new multi-core infrastructure. Kimball made early progress, but then reflecting some more. 2 fold goal: every distribution has OpenEXR as part of it (Mac, Linux, Windows, BSD), need to make it so that if we release a minor version with new functionality, we don’t make all the software which uses OpenEXR non functional. So one more change that will change the ABI yet again, but will be stable going forward. C layer is already stable, could release a version 4, people who had linked against version 3 would still be fine. Recognize that we are meant to be a stable component. A shift from the VFX Reference platform in a way, will need to coordinate with them. Previously had to lock versions because of the namespace issue, every VFX platform release had different namespaces. But by default it will now be stable. | . | Core/Multithreading in the C++ API . | Will this incorporate TBB? Issues with VFX Platform moving to oneTBB? Kimball: switched WETA to OneTBB 2 years ago, no issues, had more issues with OpenMP. OpenEXR has its own thread pool, pre-existing TBB. In 3.x can swap out with your own threadpool, and someone recently asked questions about using TBB worker pool. Seems like it would be possible. Main issue is that different threads can be reading different files or the same file handle, so need to handle re-entrancy. Task Group changes in OneTBB may have been holding up some projects | . | Website overhaul . | Website is in need of work | Taking cues from OCIO website, using that as a basis / reusing | Will be happening soon | . | . | Roadmap: Call for Community Contribution . | GPU-side enablement . | Sending images directly from disk to GPU and decode there | . | New compression schemes . | Could be contributed by someone external | . | PyBind11 for Imath (retire boost dependency) . | Would be a major improvement | Daniel: there seems to be a strange mapping coverage for accessing EXR files from Python, no elegant way (pip install). Seems like a strange thing given how significant EXR is for machine vision applications. There’s a very old version of the python bindings, is this a category where looking for broader contribution? | Kimball: had included this in Open Source Days update. There are a number of Python wrappings around OpenEXR out there, none of which are affiliated, or well supported. Not sure what to do about it, except we need to do something about it. We think our position should be that if you want Python bindings, use OIIO. Larry: but lacks a “pip install”. Larry: the leading bindings for OpenEXR were un-maintained for a while, now they are maintained, but put a new wrapper around old API, so can’t read deep files, it’s not maintained, not coupled to the version numbers in the project. Need a decent implementation of PYthon bindings. It’s not rocket science, someone casually familiar with C++ bindings / pybind11 should be able to do this. | Cary: who’s going to do it and when is the question and where it gets bogged down. Everyone on the TSC has this as a side gig. There used to be someone at ILM who was full time staff on EXR, but that’s not the case anymore, we’re all squeezing this “on the side”. It would be great to have a contribution from someone who is going to use it as well as develop it. How do we identify a contributor like that? Larry: it’s not a FTE, there may be periods of time where more work is needed (new features in general). If a ASWF member was looking at how to use a portion of their FTE… A day a week contribution would make a big difference. | JT: Conda and Anaconda manages OpenEXR better than pip. Those are major platforms for AI and ML. I haven’t used OpenEXR in this setting but I have used the platforms. | . | Example images: . | https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr-images | Need to modernize these reference images, they are pretty old, early years of the format. Want to update them with representative images in terms of pixel and metadata content. | . | Performance metrics . | Suite of performance metrics | https://aras-p.info/blog/2021/08/27/EXR-Filtering-and-ZFP/ | Recommended changing the default compression ratio as result of the research. Very nice to have a suggestion for a change backed up by data. An example of someone outside the standard community making a valuable contribution. | Larry: he writes amazing blog posts, does “drive bys” on various projects and always improves things. Recommendation was just to change the default level of Zip compression to compress by 3% more disk space but double the EXR writing speed, which is very helpful. | . | Project weaknesses / needs . | Windows support . | We struggle with this. Nick does lion’s share of Windows support | . | Hardware-we-don’t-have support . | “Test fails on some new or old hardware we don’t have access to”. We use the GitHub CI infrastructure, but it would be great to have easier access to hardware. | Kimball: if we don’t have this hardware, we can make suggestions. ARM came up recently. Wave: encouraging someone on my team to join meetings, they do a lot of EXR work here. Cary: was going to come asking! Would also be very helpful to have someone from NVIDIA join meetings. | . | Widening the contributor community . | More substantial contributions from outside contributors | . | Transition planning . | Future of TSC, not everyone will be there forever, figuring out who to pass the stewardship to and when | . | . | David: Unreal Engine 5.1 supports EXR 3.1.5, there in a new way. | https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/unreal-engine-5-1-is-now-available | In Unreal Engine 5.1, the new Media Plate Actor enables OpenEXR support, enabling users to simply drag and drop footage from the Content Browser. In addition, users can now play back mipmapped and tiled uncompressed EXRs both in engine and with nDisplay with the appropriate SSD RAID, and now have the ability to convert EXRs to the correct format for optimum playback | . | . | . | Marketing Plan / Non contributor survey | Scott: security WG proposal will probably have something in the new year | .

    "content": "The Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) is collaboration between the Linux Foundation and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, serving as an umbrella organization that is the home to several key open source software projects used by the film industry (primarily visual effects and animation production). The projects we manage are some of the most high-profile and widely used open source projects originating and used in film production studios. It’s a great opportunity for students to get involved with projects that will be used professionally on films! . The mission of the ASWF is to increase the quality and quantity of contributions to the content creation industry’s open source software base; to provide a neutral forum to coordinate cross-project efforts; to provide a common build and test infrastructure; and to provide individuals and organizations a clear path to participation in advancing our open source ecosystem. Member projects are focused primarily on visual effects and animation production, and at present include 8 distinct software packages. Summer project applications can be for any of these packages individually, as well as potentially including tasks that bridge between them or provide common infrastructure (they share CI and other resources). The current member projects are: . | OpenColorIO : A complete color management solution geared towards motion picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation. | OpenCue : A render management / job queueing system you can deploy for visual effects and animation productions. | OpenEXR : The specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, the professional-grade image storage format of the motion picture industry. | Open Shading Language : The de facto standard shading and pattern language of physically-based renderers used for film VFX and animation. | OpenTimelineIO : API and interchange format for editorial timeline information. | OpenVDB : Hierarchical data structure and a suite of tools for the efficient storage and manipulation of sparse volumetric data. | MaterialX : An open standard for representing rich material and look-development content in computer graphics, enabling its platform-independent description and exchange across applications and renderers. | Rez : Rez is a cross-platform package manager with a difference. Instead of installing to separate environments, all package versions are installed into a central repository, and standalone environments reference these existing packages. | . In addition to typical software projects, the ASWF also forms Working Groups to tackle industry-wide or non-traditional projects such as python3 migration, diversity &amp; inclusion, and the creation of Rust bindings for ASWF projects. The Rust Working Group is included in the project ideas list for 2022! . ",

The individual projects are listed below with their home pages, GitHub repositories, and a list of possible projects. You may choose a summer task from any of our software projects. It is also permissible to propose (a) a task that is common infrastructure shared by the projects, such as with our CI system; (b) a task that crosses project boundaries or involves two projects; (c) a task that is technically in a non-ASWF code base but for which our organization is an appropriate mentor (as an illustrative example: adding comprehensive OpenColorIO support to a widely used open source project). All of our projects maintain their own CONTRIBUTING guidelines, please read them for the project you are interested in. They each also have separate contributor license agreements (CLAs) which must be signed for them to accept contributions. Successfully submitting a Pull Request to the ASWF software project you are applying to is a strict requirement prior to submitting an application. This is not negotiable. We will not even read applications from students who have not submitted an acceptable PR to the project they are applying to participate in. It can be a truly minimal change – for example, fixing a typo in an error message. The purpose of this requirement is to prove that you already have the skills to set up a GitHub login, successfully clone the project, build it, make a change, submit a PR, and interact with the community for code review. In addition to ideas listed below, the GitHub “Issues” page for each project will have issues tagged “GSoC” if they seem like an appropriate size for a GSoC summer project. You will also see many issues tagged “good first issue”, those might be ideal candidates for your small trial PR to qualify for application.

    "content": "OpenColorIO . Home page: https://opencolorio.org/ GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: C++11, CMake, color science . Mentor suggestions: Michael Dolan, Mark Boorer . Project Ideas: . | Add OCIO support to FFmpeg or another FOSS project . | An important effort for OCIO is expanding the libraries and applications where OCIO is implemented. Users have specifically called out FFmpeg as a library and command-line tool where they would like to see OCIO support, but any other FOSS project leveraged by digital artists or production pipelines could be considered. This could also include upgrading an existing implementation to support the OCIO v2 API and leverage new functionality. | Special skills: Familiarity with prospective host library or tool, and knowledge of working with image buffers and authoring plugins. | . | Implement OCIO within webassembly &amp; develop a small proof of concept app in-browser. | First ensure working compilation of OCIO into WASM | Develop a small prototype app such as: image viewer with input colorspace and output view/display control | . | . Open Shading Language (OSL) . GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenShadingLanguage Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: . Mentor suggestion: Larry Gritz . Project Ideas: . | Overhaul/enhancement of osltoy: . | “osltoy” is a sample application that ships with OSL, a Qt-based GUI app that runs shaders, lets you edit the code or fiddle with the parameters, and see the results interactively an a displayed and continually updated “image.” It’s a bit like https://www.shadertoy.com/ but for OSL, and it’s a local app rather than a web service. It’s a fun way to tinker with shaders, and some studios have used it as the basis for teaching introductory OSL classes. This summer task would be to turn osltoy into a more full-featured, slicker tool that can let people do more of the things that people do with shadertoy – including provisions for saving results from one frame that can be available to the next frame, making keyboard/mouse input available to the shader to respond to, etc. | . | Improved oslc error reporting: . | One component of osl is “oslc”, which is a relatively straightforward compiler from osl source code to an intermediate code. There are two ways that we could improve the user experience with oslc where error reporting is concerned, and both only require diving into the basic parsing (not the IR code generation or anything farther downstream): (1) Instrument oslc’s parser fully with the code to record column positions (in addition to the lines it currently records) of each syntactic structure, and rig error messages to give those nice modern outputs where it quotes the lines and underscores the particular words or sections containing the error. (2) Make errors involving unknown identifiers print likely suggestions (based on Levenshtein Distance), so instead of errors like “unknown function ‘foo’”, it might also print a specific suggestion for what they probably wanted but had misspelled. | . | . OpenEXR . Home page: https://www.openexr.com/ GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: . Mentor suggestions: Kimball Thurston, Cary Phillips, Larry Gritz, Nick Porcino . Project Ideas: . | Explore Other Compression Schemes. | OpenEXR currently supports lossless compression through zlib, but other more modern compression schemes exist. We would like to explore adding additional options for compressing with other utilities, such was Zstandard. To do this properly, we also need to assemble a standard set of images to use as benchmarks, and also develop some basic performance metrics in order to compare compression/decompression time across different options. | . | Performance Metric Suite . | OpenEXR needs a mechanism for quantifying read/write and compress/decompress times. | . | A Fast Header Read . | Extend the OpenEXR API with a way to read just the header attributes you request, and nothing else, for efficiency when applications need only the header information but no pixel data. | . | Add a Part Type That is Only Metadata . | An image part that holds only metada with no pixel data could be useful for managing metadata in motion picture pipelines. | . | Add support for bfloat16 . | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format | Adding a new pixel type might be tricky, and may present backwards compatibility issues. | . | Add Support for Sorting of Attributes . | Currently, attributes are written and read in alphabetical order in the file, and stored alphabetically internally. But sometimes it would be convenient to organize and present them in the API, or GUI’s, in a logical, non-alphabetical order. The solution needs some investigation, but it might involve changing the internal attribute storage mechanism, or leaving the internal representation alone and adding an “order” attribute to store the preferred order. | . | Convert boost::python Imath Bindings to pybind11 . | Eliminate Imath’s dependency on boost/boost_python by re-implementing the bindings using pybind11. | . | Add a New Spectral Attribute Type . | Follow up on Alban Fichet’s spectral image storage presentation by implementing a custom attribute to hold the spectra: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03252797 | . | Switch C++ API to Use the New C Core . | Retrofit the existing C++ API to use the new thread-safe C API underneath | . | . OpenVDB . Home page: https://www.openvdb.org/ GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: C++14, Git, CMake, (Knowledge of Houdini is also useful) . Mentor suggestions: Ken Museth, Dan Bailey, Nick Avramoussis . Project Ideas: . | Improve our unit-test coverage . | Run gcov to get a measure of code coverage | List the tools and functions that are not covered by the unit tests | Write unit-tests for these tools and functions | Go through each unit-test file to refactor them (e.g. TestTools.cc) | . | Using Agner Fog’s vector class wrapper library, improve the performance of OpenVDB algorithms with the use of SIMD intrinsics: . | Introduce VCL to the CMake build system and installation. | Identify a few easy algorithms to start with e.g. ::fill() ::clip() and confirm performance on compatible hardware | Where it makes sense to do so, re-work algorithms to take advantage of SIMD usage | Provide performance metrics with any changes. | . | Implement the Swept Volume Algorithm: . | Read the paper (https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/projects/swept-volumes/swept-volumes.pdf) | Write a pseudo-code | Create 2 - 3 examples of inputs (consisting of a pair of a polygon mesh and a trajectory) to the algorithm | Implement the swept volume algorithm in the OpenVDB library | Write unit-test, possibly using the example inputs created in an early step . | Implement a Houdini SOP to call the swept-volume algorithm | . | . | . Rust Working Group . Home page: Github: https://github.com/vfx-rs Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: Rust, C++ . Mentor Suggestions: Anders Langlands, Luke, Scott Wilson . | Rewrite/refactor CPPMM . | CPPMM is our main tool to create the C and unsafe *-sys Rust bindings. It may be worth promoting to a product maintained by the ASWF, and used for other projects (including our own). The current implementation’s design does not make it very easy to extend to C++ projects outside of what’s currently being supported, so some work is needed to make it more extensible and support more valid C++ code. | . | Write bindings for unclaimed projects . | Currently there are some bindings that are unclaimed (see README.md in the vfx-rs repo) that could use someone to build. | . | Make C++ projects more Rust friendly . | There are some APIs that are not very Rust friendly, and also are considered difficult to support on the C++ side. The goal would be to work with the parent projects to update the problematic APIs. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Issues joining the call: TAC meeting fell out of most people’s calendar | John: Review refactored TAC site: https://deploy-preview-369–aswf-tac.netlify.app/ . | John: on vacation | . | Emily (via Slack): Open Source Forum is Feb. 16 in LA. | Call for speakers is open, closes January 20. | The registration site will open next Wednesday (18th). The event will be open and free for all members and select community members (ie those active on the tac or a project). A reg code will be sent next week. There will be a nominal fee for non-members. | We will also have a virtual attendee option. | Carol: what happens if we don’t have submissions? | David: projects should be submitting. Feedback that preparing an update for each project is a bit of a distraction, we are OK to prepare substantial update for Open Source Days. Recasting Open Source Forum at a higher level, we can still present our projects if we have something to present to the group, if it’s the right time to present to the community. But you should submit what you would like to do. Also you should submit ideas for presentations, did polls on who should be a keynote speaker, we are reaching out to a few people. But if you have other ideas of what would be valuable to our community, including technical topics not necessarily under our Foundation. We will pick from those presentations to make up Open Source Forum. The vision for Open Source Forum is that it becomes a vibrant place where we have a variety of presenters, not just from our group, but others in the industry. For instance, over the Holidays there’s been talk about a new programming language for the Metaverse, would that be a topic of interest? | Eric: 3 types of presentations on the CFP: 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 40 minute panel | . | Project Review Schedule: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSupkBl5UHNCZULw7uGCLrI95kjGa7978wdtgx9hE-6f3waPo2s1K8QAoyhvQUniYhIYpkBjCuIhz_2/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true . | Eric: won’t be ready for project review in 2 weeks, don’t have download statistics yet. Waiting for LF IT. | Jonathan: move to 2 weeks for now, taking over the DPEL slot. | . | David: Budget presentation to happen at next meeting with Andrew Pearce, chairman of budget committee. | Discussion: brainstorming session for year coming ahead . | Scott: proposal for a project I’d like to present to the TAC, can do it now or another time. | Plant the seed, will do it without the slides. I have a project that is a framework for building a validation system within studios. Need to validate your character rig is correct, all the right check boxes are checked, the framework lets you write your checks based on studio requirements, give results, perhaps automatically fix issues. It’s open sourced, but haven’t made an official announcement, would like to see if ASWF would be interested in owning the project. ASWF is a neutral forum for people to contribute, and a larger entity to just my own GitHub repo. Want to make sure that if this project has “legs”, that it will outlast me, project can continue without me. | Eric: is each of the check a shell command? Scott: it’s all done within the process, but could be a shell command. Eric: the process loads the USD / EXR / Maya file? Scott: could do it this way. But typically can run it within the DCC (Maya), show feedback to artist of what checks passed and failed. Eric/Michael: how does it relate to all the DCCs? Scott: run the checks within Houdini / Maya / … so the file is already loaded at this time. | https://github.com/scott-wilson/checks | . | Larry: revisiting idea to create a WG on real time / virtual production. Does anyone have ideas they want to share . | David: an emerging section of our industry, compared to other technologies currently in the ASWF. Lots of companies are very active in this new field. There’s a sense that it’s a good time at the beginning of this new “branch” of what can be open sourced, get companies that may not be thinking about that at this stage. See if they can contribute something. Netflix ahead of the curve, has open sourced a few tools related to VP, seeds that can be used. A need to get to the bottom of how things are actually done in VP: shows are coming out, they are making various claims. We will hear a lot from Avatar at WETA, but smaller shows, episodic, will use in-camera VFX, how was the video wall actually used. There isn’t a forum that groups all the vendors and studios, could be the first step for a WG to be a forum for case studies, sharing info about VP, aiming towards developing open source in that area. Has anyone had time to think about the concept? | Carol: what you are proposing makes sense, but we need to do a good job of being very specific as to what this WG is intended to be doing. There are lots of groups talking about VP: ETC, SMPTE, all working on production related topics. If we want to get into this space with a WG, we need to figure out exactly how we relate to software for that space. Obviously we’ll have to talk about the whole aspect. Look at what comes out of these other groups, and figure out how we can talk about it from a software point of view. | Larry: a ASWF WG could look at 3 areas: . | Are there things that our existing projects should be doing to be better situated for this space. For instance, in OpenEXR, should there be a different compression method that would allow better streaming to the GPU and decompression on the GPU | Is there software already developed by member companies that should be open source but hasn’t been. Encourage companies to turn those into projects. | Are the people working in this space struggling with gaps which could be addressed by a project. | . | Larry: These 3 topics seem specific to what we do and know. David: makes sense, thank you Larry. Feedback from Carol and Larry can inform where to go. We may want to attract new member companies, dozens of companies specializing in writing software for VP. | Wave: if there was an end goal that would make sense in ASWF context, a WG trying to figure out a specific goal for VP. That’s what we did with DPEL, we realized we needed a license. Is there something that this WG could develop that isn’t being addressed by other organizations. Laura: could first gather requirements, and what exists already. Not everyone in the space are talking to each other. David: sounds like we need an exploratory group / meeting, what can be done in the context of our mission, a place where we can invite those SMEs on VP in our companies or outside the foundation. Wave: similar to Open Review, a group of people at companies talked over 2 years. David: could be a case study / series of case studies, look at what it’s done. Would be good to have a WETA case study on Avatar from the software perspective. | . | Carol: idea of a Hackathon, which would need to be supported by TAC and project TSCs, start to think about the scale and what we would want to tackle on the first attempt . | David: we have a Hackathon on the program for 2023, try to enlist new engineers outside of existing contributors | Carol: when Rachel and I have talked about this, wearing both the OCIO and D&amp;I “hats”. Thinking about what we need in OCIO, how those two things can combine. In order for people to get involved and complete an issue, they have to have a lot of knowledge about our industry. We thought it would be good that for first Hackathon, try to target more junior engineers in member companies, who aren’t currently involved in ASWF. People who might show interest if presented with opportunity. Can target people already in the industry, and help us bring in folks who aren’t already involved but could be interested. Member companies should state their interest in participating, having it over 48h period would be best (or 24h), people could participate as part of their day job. From project perspective, may not include every project as this Hackathon, pick a few projects willing to go in and increase number of “Good First Issues”, also be willing to dedicate resources to be available to help with onboarding issues. | Larry: I like this. One of the benefits is that often there’s a single person who has deep development knowledge, so that can help a company to have more than a single person. Some studios may need to increase their level of internal expertise. | Scott: would their be issues forwarding the Hackathon link to TDs in different studios? Carol: we haven’t gotten that far, but definitely seems we would welcome other studios as well. | JF: value to projects in helping to figure out barriers to contribution | Carol: hopefully we can improve the onboarding for all the projects, even if they don’t all participate | David: that’s good, thank you. We need to expand our pool of engineers, will be good if we can help Carol. Tentative schedule towards end of year, before or after SIGGRAPH. We have a bit of time to figure it out, let’s help Carol! | Eric: virtual or co-located? Carol: likely virtual due to logistics. Could be that participating companies say that people come into the office, so could be “hybrid”. | . | . | . ",

Raised issues within LF project management, actions were taken to resolve it. Other projects ran into these issues, believe issues should be resolved. | Larry: Google Summer of Code has been announced a couple of days ago. Deadline for organizations is in a couple of weeks. 3 years ago we did it and had a successful program. 2 years ago we declined due to half size projects. Last year they went to full projects, we applied but didn’t get any good applications so we declined. Not sure what we want to do this year? Carol: having gone through it last year from OCIO perspective, not sure we would be interested in doing this again, unless we’re all prepared to put decent resources into it. Find candidates who could apply to our projects. There may be lots of good engineers out there, but without the context to contribute effectively to our projects. We need to be willing to step in and put in the work. Would rather focus on efforts that can more broadly benefit ASWF, like Hackathon. OCIO discussed Season of Docs, could be interested, and would pick Season of Docs over GSOC. Larry: do you think someone not previously associated with project could write useful docs? Carol: have reached out to tech writers before, helping us document in words some previous SIGGRAPH presentations, we had some success, but didn’t end up proceeding. But for OCIO, I believe we could get something that’s specific enough that someone outside the space could be helpful. Would still be a lot of work. | John (Chat): Proposal template for Google Season of Docs | . | Daniel: what made the difference between a successful year and not so successful? Larry: other projects ran into problems, have a theory that they had a rule change that it was restricted to students, but could be any students, some had contributed before, on ImageIO had students who came back year after year. They opened up to new students, and excluded experienced contributors. Also the stipend amount is no longer competitive with what a student could get in a real internship. Now a student may rather go work for a company in a summer job for instance. | MaterialX Project Review (Jonathan): . | First project update for MaterialX, haven’t done one before. First update of 2023, hopefully we can set a good tone, was a big fan of the OpenEXR presentation. | Origins: . | Launched at ILM in 2012 | Goal is to express materials independently of application or renderer | First production use on Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015, used on almost every show since. | . | Industry Collaborations . | First collaboration with Autodesk in 2016 | Released as Open Source in 2017 | Evolved through collaboration with Pixar, Adobe, SideFX, NVIDIA and others | Joined the ASWF in July 2021 | . | Technical Steering Committee (2023) . | 16 members representing 12 companies . | Adobe, Apple, AMD, Autodesk, Epic, IKEA, ILM, Khronos, NVIDIA, Pixar, SideFX, SPI | . | 5 voting members, 11 stakeholders | 36 meetings since joining ASWF, usually 10-15 people, 2-3 people outside the TSC interested in a subject | All meeting are open to the community | . | MaterialX commits by year: 150 or so by year until 2021, 250 in 2022 | MaterialX Contributors by year: 5-10 in 2017-2020, 15 in 2021, 22 in 2022. Steady progress since 2018. Now seeing contributions from individuals. | New MaterialX integrations by year: . | 2018: Arnold | 2019: USD | 2020: Substance Designer | 2021: Clarisse, Houdini, Renderman | 2022: NVIDIA Omniverse, Maya, Unreal Engine, three.js | . | MaterialX Closures in OSL . | Collaboration between the OSL and MaterialX teams | Adds OSL closures matching the MaterialX Physically Based Shading Nodes | Presented by Adrien Herubel and Chris Kulla at Open Source Days 2022 | Released in OSL 1.12 | A real “door opener”, testament to the power of ASWF, collaboration between projects | . | MaterialX Web Viewer . | Adds support for MaterialX in 3D web applications | Presented by Orn Gunnarsson and Bernard Kowk at Open Source Days 2022 | Contributed to the MaterialX project by Autodesk | Relates to platforms like three.js, an important area for future development | . | Open Chess Set . | Reference asset based on MaterialX and Standard Surface | Presented by Mooen Sayer at OSD 2022 | Contributed to the MaterialX project by SideFX | Represents production quality assets, leverage sophisticated rendering techniques | . | Roadmap for 2023: Industry Collaborations . | Improved USD / MaterialX integration | Improved OSL closure integration | Contribution of new BSDF and noise nodes from vendors and community, SideFX has some ideas for noise nodes, Adobe has ideas for BSDF nodes, also expecting contributions from Renderman team | Open MaterialX Graph Editor: developed at ILM, about to be merge | Autodesk LookdevX: dedicated MaterialX graph editor, very high quality. Both packages will make a big difference in MaterialX ecosystem | . | Roadmap for 2023: OpenSSF best practices . | Silver Badge: 93% | Gold Badge: 61% | Among needed improvements are: . | Statement coverage metrics | Signed releases | Can learn from other ASWF projects | . | . | Thank You! Questions? . | JF: GPU test suite? Jonathan: currently using software rendering, are aware that OCIO leverages AWS. Larry: there are late breaking changes, GitHub Actions starting to offer for pay larger machines, including with GPUs. Jonathan: that’s exciting. | Kimball: are there tests you want to run inside renderers? Or does that not matter, and rely on renderer vendors to do those tests? Jonathan: currently only do open source tests. Could integrate some types of MDL rendering. Would avoid integrating vendor in our test suite, but may want more open source renderers (Blender, AppleSeed). | Larry: is there anything you need from the TAC, the CI group, from other projects? Jonathan: GPU rendering and security, conversations on that would be valuable. | Daniel: can you get complete test coverage without GPU? Jonathan: GPU would make that much easier, very restricted on what we can run, can’t run entire suite in a single run. JF: larger CPU runners could help. | Daniel: you presented to Kronos group earlier this week, is there anything we should do to support you for broader reach out to adjacent fields like Metaverse? Jonathan: first time we’ve spoken to Kronos group on this topic, was very productive. Have been asked to speak at Metaverse forum, it’s important to keep up abreast of these opportunities. MaterialX as bridge between USD and glTF. Would like to know about future opportunities. David: MaterialX shows in these other contexts further away from Motion Picture VFX context, thank you. | . | . | Joint White Paper with MovieLabs around Software Security: Jim Helman . | This came out of discussions with John, MovieLabs has been doing a number of initiatives, one involving security. Some of us haven’t interacted with MovieLabs. | Came out of work from MovieLabs 2030 Vision, looking at workflows as they move to the cloud, 3 white papers: | Studio Technology joint venture: . | Paramount | Sony | Universal | Disney | Warner Brothers | . | Paper series advancing: . | A software and cloud vision for the future of production | A new security architecture | Automation through software-defined workflows | Ontology, Visual Language | . | Daniel (Chat): CSAP - Common Security Architecture for Production | The Evolution of Media Creation | The Evolution of Production Security | The Evolution of Production Workflows | Trying to move studios and vendors to the cloud world that the studio production technology people think we are moving to | Separate documents detailing the security architecture | Put out a Visual Language for diagramming workflows, used at HPA, number of presentations | Also an Ontology to get commonality on terms, high level metadata, ability to tie assets back to concepts of movie production | Security work isn’t focussed on processes or control or all CVEs get addressed, focus is on the architecture and the technologies we think need to be used as we move to the cloud. | Moving from perimeter based security, locked down within infrastructure in an organization. | The cloud is a global production resource outside of facilities’ infrastructures | Workflows run in the cloud with applications coming to the assets | Need to move to a Zero Trust model | Are some of these things potentially useful to ASWF projects. | Relevance of MovieLabs security infrastructure to ASWF projects (CSAP) | Possibly engagement areas: . | Best practices for implementing Zero Trust AuthN / AuthZ? Talks? | . | A lot of ASWF projects are libraries, don’t need to implement security infrastructure since they will be wrapped in an application. So not every project needs to be security aware. And some services can be put behind a security gateway. | Also have a language to help describe security policies. | Are there projects that operate as services, operating on the Internet? Could be a white paper, talks, … | Spencer Stephens (MovieLabs): needs to be a conscious decision, “secure by design”. Security perimeters are going to break down. | Kimball: there are layers in OpenEXR and OpenImageIO (and OpenAssetIO) where we have interfaces around file I/O, if we can make a shared library we all use that implements I/O practices so they go through authentication protocols so that every project doesn’t have to re-implement that. Also how do we better do telemetry and tracing of functions through these libraries. Again, would like a common infrastructure, logging and audit trails. Spencer (Chat): Telemetry is critical to zero-trust. Trust inference and continuous trust validation improve security but they require a good understanding of what is normal. | Daniel: although most of our libraries (except for OpenCue) are in-process, there is a pressing interest and need to move beyond that for the way software is developed in our industry. How do we start thinking about service oriented / distributed approaches, which is crucial. Provide necessary functionality with security best practices. Kimball’s example with file I/O is first use case. Kimball: we’ve also talked about centralizing file access and use across multiple projects. Jim: very interested in OpenAssetIO, 2030 paper talks about using URIs instead of URL or filenames. | Eric Reineke (Chat): I think OpenAssetIO is a bit more about identifiers and resolving those to storage assets, not so much about how bytes are brokered. JC (Chat): You are right I think. The focus of OpenAssetIO is to resolve assets, not read/write files.. | Eric Reineke (Chat): The Problem around asset location is layered: . | What thing is this (version is probably part of that) | What representation of the thing is right for my use case (proxy, medRes, DolbyVision, cameral original, etc.) | What storage location is best for my use case (S3, network mount, http, ShotGrid, etc) | give me the bytes for that thing | . | Deke Kincaid (Chat): Outside the scope of Movielab but very Rez related is recent issues around Pypi and npm hacks and securing artifacts. Malicious code making it into peoples internal repos. | Stephen Mackenzie (Chat): Most rez pipelines are wrapping other software management tools, like pip, so it’s more of a fun case of Spiderman finger pointing | Eric: OpenReview Initiative would be the “poster child”, we are in our infancy, 2 large projects have open sourced, RV and Xstudio, media players with expectation of shared collaboration on pre-release content. Both at the user level and cross studio/vendor/facility level, we’re not there yet from a project perspective, the two tools that were released aren’t in a position to do this right now, they are perimeter managed, but it is on our roadmap on how to bridge perimeters, do collaborative reviews. So a conversation of how to think about Zero Trust, Identity and Access Management, and encryption for storage and transport, OpenReview Initiative is definitely needing to address this. | Jim: OpenReview Initiative, OpenCue, and some kind of file access abstraction have relevant needs. Kimball: also we can use a general statement around best practices, writing safe code. JC: OpenSSF provides some of this. Scott (Chat): Isn’t there a project that is spinning off from OIIO’s file proxy type? Larry (Chat): Yes, here: https://github.com/foundrytom/proposals/pull/1 | Larry (Chat): OpenCue would be the obvious one. Brian (Chat): For sure. Very interested in this! Scott (Chat): Yeah, I think OpenCue is the most obvious thing.Also, something that is interesting is capability based file read/writes. For example, https://crates.io/crates/cap-std. Not sure if this is something that should be integrated in the libraries, or not. | JT (Chat): Is JoshM here? OpenTimelineIO is the other project that has a user facing app and a lot of i/o. | John: number one concern from LF projects is where to find expertise to meet requirements, SFF badging. If there is an opportunity to leverage the exposure of MovieLabs to the industry, can we leverage some of their expertise. What should we be looking projects to make sure they take security seriously. There is a laundry list of things we could get into, but is this an opportunity to establish the “center of thought leadership” between our two organizations. | Josh: the MovieLabs white papers have been very helpful to me to see how the rest of the industry is thinking of the context of how our software is used. Understand workflows, where things are headed. Encourage others to read those, where things like ORI, OTIO should be moving towards. | Jim: it sounds like there is interest, would next step would be for a group to chat about what next steps and engagement would be? Kimball, how do these things usually proceed? Kimball: would propose forming a Working Group to look at this, there isn’t an existing WG that would apply. JC: isn’t’ there a new WG? Or a Slack channel? #wg-security Kimball: yes, but if we want to write white papers, a WG could be useful. But we can start with the Slack channel, when that becomes active, we can start the more formal process of starting a WG. | John: we can collaborate on a charter for a WG that can be presented to TAC. Existing Slack channel can be a place to start, if there’s enough of a group of interest, can start putting a doc together, can help facility and get this going, bring in relevant LF resources as it makes sense. | Jim: look forward to more engagement between MovieLabs and ASWF. | Scott (Chat): The supply chain issues reminds me of this project: https://github.com/crev-dev/crev Basically crowd sourced code review. Time to that wg up and running. I was going to come up with a proposal, but I lack the time/energy. | . | Emily: project updates for Open Source Forum . | Open Source Forum on Feb 16 in LA, in person and virtual | Free for members, fee for non-members: $50 in person (includes lunch), $20 virtual | Members will get an email will get the free registration code, you can share it with active contributors if you want | Schedule . | 11-12AM: ASWF Governing Board / Leadership Meeting | 12-1 Lunch (all in person attendees) | 1-5 Open Source Forum. If you wanted to submit a topic and missed the deadline, send it to me. Just need a title and a paragraph abstract, target is 20 minutes. Program committee meets tomorrow. | David will be doing a slide on each project, will be looking for 3-4 top highlights from each project, achievements from last year or looking forward to next year | Hopefully less work than the 5 minute presentations that were asked of last year | . | . | .

David: we are preparing Open Source Forum next week, out of feedback from last year, the update on projects was a bit complicated, everyone showing up for 5 minute update. So only doing projects that submitted to the forum, but want to give a project on every project in the State of the Foundation presentation, so from TSC chairs, need a 1 slide topic with 4 topics in it (will provide template in Slack channel): . | Goal: | Latest development(s) | List of integrations (applications / vendors) | Breaking News | One good image | . | Reminder on GSoD - applications close 3/24 . | Doesn’t look like GSoC had interest and the application window has closed | John: GSoD still open, so a bit different of a structure. Happy to help coordinate if interest. | . | Digipro Submission Deadline: Friday May 12, 2023, 11:59pm PDT (UTC-7:00). | Call for papers just went up | Details: DigiPro Conference | . | SIGGRAPH open till Feb | Rust Working Group Project Review (Scott) . | About: . | Goal is to create a framework for building Rust bindings for libraries | … | . | Tracked Bindings . | Alembic | Imath | MaterialX | OSL | OCIO | OpenEXR - In progress | OpenImageIO - In progress | … | . | CPPMM and Babble . | Design . | Create C and “unsafe” Rust bindings from a C++ project | . | Goals . | Make selling the bindings easier - bound projects get a free automatically generated C API | Make generating the “unsafe” bindings easier and less tedious | . | Status . | CPPMM has been superseded by Babble due to design issues with CPPMM | Babble is in a working state, but very incomplete - missing core pieces, and support for complex project requirements | . | . | Issues . | Progress on binding projects has slowed down drastically | Progress on Babble has slowed down | Projects have a key dependency, Babble, which is incomplete | Babble is mostly developed by one developer, who is understandably busy with life outside of the Rust Working Group | . | Possible Solutions . | Get more developers working on Babble . | Identify how Babble could be useful outside of creating Rust bindings | Make sure the onboarding process is as easy as possible | Make sure there are several developers who know Babble very well to manage the project | . | Investigate other binding generators . | Drop the requirement that we also produce C bindings | Investigate other Rust binding generators such as cpp and cxx | . | Try to pull interested parties from the Rust community and VFX community together . | Advertise on popular forums | Present small tasks that may spark curiosity | Make the projects as easy to hack on as possible | . | . | We’re in a state where it could be better, but this is the direction we’re hoping to be in for 2023, hoping to bring bindings to all the packages. Overview of where we are at. | Larry: Kimball and I were in a OpenEXR TSC meeting where we were wondering about the Rust bindings, wondering what is going on. Same for OpenImageIO. Wondering if the original effort of putting Rust binding on the most used projects has been sidelined by effort to find a general solution? Should there be a parallel track of identifying projects that need Rust bindings, willing to add a C API themselves later on. Don’t stop working on general solution, but maybe also look at project specific solutions. Could ask projects to generate C bindings themselves. Scott: there is an automatic system from C to Rust, but there’s also an automatic C++ to Rust, but the C option would be the most complete solution. If projects all have C bindings, at that point it makes things a bit easier, but also harder in other ways. Still need to make sure these C bindings are safe within the Rust environment. Larry: you want to make Safe Rust bindings around the unsafe ones. Rust group would have expertise for that. But individual projects can help. Scott: either go with cpp/cxx crate to build the bindings, but if the projects are interested in creating C bindings, we are also interested in those. Larry: projects could be motivated in creating C API to get access from Rust. If the issue is that there are constructs in C++ that are problematic, would consider an alternate different C++ interface that would be easier to wrap. Kimball: created the core library in EXR to make bindings easier, not just from Rust, but also Python and others. Eric R: do we have users that are enthusiastically waiting to adopt these? Scott: have spoken to people interested in consuming these Rust bindings. Larry: probably a lot of people interested in exploring Rust, but lack of access to important libraries makes that difficult. Scott: the WG needs to determine what’s the direction that makes most sense. We bet on CPPMM / Babble to do this work, but it hasn’t hit the mark, so need to re-evaluate. | Kimball: My perspective tends to be language agnostic, was hoping to see from Rust WG a good framework for ownership of bindings, in EXR project we didn’t do a good job of managing Python bindings for EXR, we don’t have clear path to have those updated reliably. So would want a clear path for ownership of bindings. If there’s a path to determine that a library is safe because we’ve tested it through Rust, that can add value to our projects. Don’t know if CPPMM / Babble / cpp / cxx, do any of these provide some kind of static analysis of your unsafe bindings? What you guys have found on this front. Scott: there would be static analysis of the interface, but not much on the internal. The interface to OpenEXR is a black box to Rust. so can’t guarantee that the C++ code is 100% safe. The Safe layer won’t access a pointer that’s invalid for instance. Kimball: was trying to see if it’s something we can integrate with memory sanitizers? But you need a full fuzzer as well. Larry: you may be on the right track, what I was hoping from Rust binding was to see which parts of the API were easier or harder to make safer, and using that as feedback to the project of how to evolve the API, import some of the Rust “sensibilities”, there’s a philosophy from Rust that is worth learning from. Scott: it would be an avenue, we need to refocus our efforts, possibly in the direction of OpenEXR bound by end of 2023, here are simple things to do, here are gnarly ones, what can we do to make the code less gnarly. JF: since Rust code would be net new, don’t need to support the entire API. Chris: have you looked at rewrites from scratch for some libraries like EXR, is that another path forward? Scott: we agreed that was a non goal. If EXR wants to rewrite in Rust, we will support them, but that’s not our goal. Chris: my experience has been to stay away from Rust packages that also require C++ building since it breaks the Rust tooling. Scott: have seen some successful Rust bindings to C++ packages, having to compile / link a C++ library such a USD is a huge thing. We don’t want to force people to recompile USD. Would be better to link existing USD C++ library, and will bind against that. | Larry: in OpenEXR, the fact that there were independently re-implemented Python wrappers that weren’t maintained by the OpenEXR project has been an ongoing nightmare / liability, intentions are good on day one, but there’s drift between official library and re-implementation / bindings. Would like to see Rust bindings owned by the project. Scott: a goal is to hand over the bindings to the project, but without just making extra work for the project. Chris: can do a fair amount with Rust even if you don’t have library projects. Are there studio projects interested in using Rust, and what’s the minimal set? Larry: we don’t have much that doesn’t need to touch ASWF projects, as well as USD, almost everything needs to connect to these projects. | Eric R: on OTIO, for the bindings that be successful, there has to be a consumer who needs them and wants them to be maintained. Can we identify one or a small set of projects that would consume Rust bindings, and focus on getting those things going. Take feedback from this experience, so we can make this repeatable. And identify what projects can do in their C / C++ API to make things easier in the future. In OTIO, we don’t have people using Rust right now, but would love to get advice on what would be easier to make Rust (or other language) bindings. | Kimball: do we want to keep the WG going, even with challenge to participation. Do you have enough direction to keep going? Scott: yes, we would like to keep going for 2023. | Larry: propose motion to keep the WG going for another year. Carol: seconded. All ayes, no opposed, one abstain. The ayes have it, we reconvene WG for 2023. Hopefully you have enough talking points to keep going. Scott: thank you very much! | Robin: bindings are nice, but do we have something more direct planned for Rust, like a tool, or just linking to other tools? Scott: for the Rust WG, the main goal is the bindings, but don’t have plans for an actual application. Personally I have plenty of plans, but currently not within ASWF. Robin: bindings aren’t the most exciting project, so having something more exciting as a project could help drive interest. Scott: I like the idea, but maybe that’s something at the TAC level. Kimball: start with some small command line pipeline tools. | Larry (Chat): Additional possible solution: ask project to routinely produce a C binding themselves, so the Rust group can focus more on the C-&gt;Rust layer. Maybe pybind11 is a good example - it’s not an automatic binding of C++ to Python, but it’s a library that makes it relatively straightforward to wrap a C++ API in Python. Maybe there’s an equivalent to Rust? | . | WrangleBot project presentation TENTATIVE (download Proposal here: https://media.prsnc.io/f/f0c80ff9a4da474b98b1/?dl=1) . | Robert Bogs and Axel from Germany | WrangleBot was released recently, multiple components, ingesting of media files, we come from the DIT side, produce TBs of data that needs to be ingested, metadata extracted. There are different tools like SilverStack, Shotput, Hedge… | Developed WrangleBot to have something that works remotely (incentive during COVID). Started as a CLI to admin computers on set via ssh, evolved from there, but wasn’t getting the feedback needed. So developed a GUI. WrangleBot Project | Core engine of WrangleBot allows you to copy and ingest footage, ingest metadata, puts is in a table, has API to work with metadata (kept in a database). Can go back and forth in time to track changes. Can also sync between devices. We have a network of tools that can access the assets over peer to peer connections. Can transfer large amounts of data directly between devices instead of having to go through cloud storage. | Already have 122 people registered / using it on set. | GUI demo: Ingest page, list of libraries that exist in a database structure. Data sets exist within libraries. Can launch jobs to copy media. There’s also a media browser, can go through all your media, can edit the metadata. Trying to get access to all the vendors. One of the issues is that we don’t have a common metadata format. Also pull thumbnails and save them to the database. | Sometimes we need to do LTO backups, it’s very hard to look at an LTO tape and figure out what’s on there, and not everyone has access to a robot. So this makes it possible to browse a library without having to access the LTO tapes. | A complex toolkit developed over the last 2 years. Gotten to a point that future developments shouldn’t be driven by a single person or company, hence why we should open source it. | JF: how do you deal with proprietary media formats? Axel: hoping that being part of a larger organization can help get this information. Create an interface where we can easily create plugins so you can attach a closed source binary plugins licensed separately, as opposed to the open source core. | Robert: does anyone have leverage on camera manufacturers? | Carol: very cool tool! Two things: you are talking about camera manufacturers, being able to read their camera files with their SDKs. Are you thinking about providing the hooks since you can’t always open source the SDKs, they are proprietary code. The stuff is not “uncomplicated”. Also if your database is centrally located, gathering info on all projects, that’s going to be an issue with studios. Axel: this is just the current implementation, but can connect to any node, and host your own database. One of our clients are state run archives, they would never want to have a hosted solution, and will want to have their own. But to have all these archives connected would allow reusing assets. Also helps with sustainability, lots of emissions from on set / on location shoots, if we could shoot less, that would help with this, but need to be able to reuse assets. Only 1% of shot footage is used in the edit: maybe that footage isn’t useful to you, but it could be useful to someone else, and maybe still worth it years in the future now that digital footage has reached a quality level which would still make it useful years from now. | Eric R: how do you secure this data transfer, even the metadata can be sensitive. Also, how is the backend modularized and easy to extend. Integrate proprietary camera SDKs, or proprietary storage systems. Axel: the system is generally agnostic to how you address your data, as long as the path is mounted in some way. Eric: it doesn’t have a concept of storage tiers for instance? Axel: no, it tries to stay “storage agnostic”, trying to bridge the gap with more naive users. All transfers are encrypted, but currently the database is not for performance reasons. But want to add end to end encryption while still meeting usability goals. | Kimball: we will continue this discussion via email / Slack | Robert: looking for feedback from experienced people. We have established ties to all the camera manufacturers, have gotten SDKs from most vendors, but not some of the largest ones. | JC: can the transfer engine be swapped, is it modular, or is it tightly integrated. Axel: the peer to peer streaming hasn’t been implemented in WrangleBot yet, the original implementation was specific to the other app, not sure if that’s going to be the implementation for WrangleBot. | . | .

J.C. - that’s correct, we want to be around to continue to provide guidance . | Kimball - I think that makes sense, we just may need to call that out specifically because by default the working groups have a time limit | Larry - Should this maybe treated as a task of the CI working group if the interested parties have high enough overlap? | John M. (via chat) - Could be just a rebrand - CI, Infrastructure, and Security WG Then perhaps subgroups focused on the deliverables as needed Either way is a good approach - just a question on resources as Larry mentioned | Kimball - If we were going to fold it into the CI working group, we should circle around and update the CI working group charter. | John M. - Another thing to consider is where is the balance of what they do for projects vs. here’s a guidance for the project about how they address certain issues | Larry - I’d expect them to provide guidance about how to navigate the process but I wouldn’t expect them to go in and fix bugs for the projects | John M. - I think where I was thinking was about whether or not the group could handle the logistics around the CVEs while the projects focus more on the code itself. | Kimball - other thoughts on separate vs. combined? | Gordon B. - I think just the name is odd bedfellows on the surface, so we may want to think about what we call the group in that case | John M. - Within CI group you’ll have certain people with expertise in devops, but the security infrastructure may require a different set of folks to support that. Would that increase in scope cause people to bring in new domain experts and change the overlap profile of the groups? | Larry - If that did happen, that would certainly make sense to break out, but that hasn’t happened yet | Larry - We’ve been scraping along with no real security expertise, cobbling together solutions. In that scope it makes sense to focus on sharing what we’ve put together. It would be nice to have better expertise, but we haven’t gotten that yet. | John M. - That brings the question of who we can have that would actually run it. Right now we’ve identified a sort of wishlist of what we’d actually want, but who can we get to drive the rigor and expertise to deliver to the endpoints. | Michael B. Johnson - I think in the case of these projects, a lot of the vendors who might otherwise know about security stuff are former studio so they may not have been exposed to much more on these matters. | Kimball - Do we need more discussion on this or should we come to a vote? | Gordon B. - I think maybe the leader doesn’t need to be a security expert to focus on identifying the kinds of things we want to do and what needs to be designed. | Kimball - I think the thing for the group to focus on is if you’re one of the projects and you receive a security report, how do we respond? How do we triage the severity of the issue? | Larry - When we receive these I don’t feel like we know how to even judge whether it’s a big threat or something we can let go. It would be great to have some process around that. | Gordon B. - I think it’s exactly that, providing the guidance about how to navigate that. | J.T. Nelson (via chat) - Either way is a good approach - just a question on resources as Larry mentioned | Carol P. - We have this working group structure, as a way to talk about this and decide what we should do. These are designed to be flexible so we can figure this stuff out. Maybe what this means is that the CI working group meets a little more frequently for a bit, then they can use that time to try and get expertise and find domain experts to help until they craft guidelines. | General agreement that we should go to the CI working group and ask if they’ll absorb this group to proceed in the way Carol pitched. | . | Open Source forum 2023 call for feedback . | Michael B. Johnson - as someone who was there, it was great, but I’d love to hear from people that called in | Kimball - I really missed the side conversations, that’s where a lot of the value is for me. I really missed that. | Larry - I felt the same way | Michael B. Johnson - The happy hour at the end was great, would’ve been great to have had that for even longer. It felt a lot like old siggraph. | Eric Enderton (from chat) - Yes, happy hour was super valuable | Carol P. - Would like to have had some more time to submit presentations | Emily O. - Would it be best to keep it as a half day, should we try and push it to a day | Laura R. - We had really good content to fill the day we had, if we extended would we have the content to fill that? | Michael B. Johnson - There was a lot of content to absorb in the time, but there is a finite amount I can absorb in a day, so that is worth considering | Tony M. - The Q&amp;A was great but the camera was at the back, so having a camera to see the audience would be great | Michael B. Johnson - The academy museum was a really good venue for me, centrally located and made it easy to get in and out | Carol P. - for people that attended remotely or current get their company to help them attend, would it being a full day impact their ability to attend? | Larry - I think it being a half day means you can fly in for a day, fly back, and avoid a hotel | General +1s from Laura R. and Michael B. Johnson | Kimball - as an international travel person, having it timed around other events like VES, Scitech, and HPA helps justify the travel cost | . | Wranglebot . | Larry - is it in use? | Carol - I think they said maybe in use for a few german pieces of content and some others maybe? | Carol - I think the general idea is cool, I’m a little unclear if they’d be able to separate the add-ons and things they monetize on top | Gordon B - I think that would be a good area to explore | Larry - my general level of skepticism for any new project applying is that it’s kind of a high bar for things that aren’t established projects. I don’t know if we want to be a place for various open source projects landing on our door. That’s just me though, not sure I have a lot to back that up. | John M. - It sounds like there is hesitancy based on where the project stands | Gordon B. - Also, right now you need the cloud to host it | General acknowledgement that that would be something that changed if they were adopted | Carol P. - I think a lot of the established studios aren’t as interested in switching over to something like this from something their using, but the question of whether something like this existing would make this kind of tool more accessible to new and smaller entities and whether we want to be helping with that. | Kimball - It sounds like we at least need to go back and get clarification on their monetization model and come back to discuss more. | Gordon - We also may want to talk about whether or not sandboxing is a one way on-ramp and becomes a commitment | John M. - One way to think about the sandbox is like being an angel investor and set expectations and have them part ways if it doesn’t pan out. It’s good to create a place where projects don’t have to get themselves lined up from bootstraps and then come to us only when they’re totally figured out | Gordon B. - One exercise would be to figure out how we evaluate whether or not a project is a good spend of resources so we understand what to add | Nick P. (via chat) - one criterion has to be “can we even pay enough attention to the sandbox project to make it worth everyone’s time” | Michael B. Johnson (via chat) - one criterion has to be “can we even pay enough attention to the sandbox project to make it worth everyone’s time” “what” not “which” | Larry (via chat) - There is a view that ASWF is primarily an exercise in risk management for the industry. The two kinds of projects we’ve admitted so far: (1) foundational projects that are established and crucial to the industry; (2) new projects that are sponsored by multiple premier members with track records of successful projects. | Kimball - We’re at time, but at a follow-up let’s discuss how to best focus our budget and how to decide where we should be spending it. | . | . | .

    "content": ". | Google Season of Docs (Carol Payne) . | No updates to share, OCIO still working on an application | Jonathan: is Google SoD application already started? Got a request on MaterialX with someone who is interested in doing a PyPI implementation for MaterialX? Carol: that sounds like Summer of Code, separate from Season of Docs, application deadline for Summer of Code has passed, ASWF not participating. Jonathan: will look closer at which program they are part of. PyPI implementation would seem like a Summer of Code thing. | . | Summer Learning Program (Carol Payne) . | Blog post launched today | Focus on underrepresented groups, LGBTIA+, accepting 20 learners. | Post to share on a LinkedIn post | SLP team led by Karen and Kaitlin has put an amazing confluence Wiki, all the SLP info is on Confluence Wiki, including volunteer opportunities (link in chat) | Also the volunteer application form for anyone interested in volunteering, even if you were a volunteer last year. Will reach out to people who volunteered last year. Asking the TAC to share this information with your networks: university, company. There’s a call for volunteers template you can copy-n-paste for your company, will want to customize it a bit. | Kimball: was fun to do last year, great program, recommend participating! | . | Rez Project Review (Stephen Mackenzie) . | Rez is pretty new in the ASWF, still lots of stuff we’re working out. | Project Info: . | Description: a lightweight cross-platform package manager written in Python | Build and release packages to a central repository, then consume them in standalone configured environments. | Lots of useful information in legacy Google Groups list, would like to get rid of it, but would like to capture this information somehow. John (chat): ping for me help on this, we’ve done this a lot before. | TSC was just formed in August | . | History . | V1 implementation at Dr.D Studios circa 2011 . | Author previously worked at MPC London | . | V2 implementation at Method Studios LA, circa 2014 . | Much more extensible - pluggable package repos | Animal Logic first external user | . | . | Incubation Progress . | DONE: . | Technical Charter Approval | Legal | Governance | LICENSE | CODEOWNERS | README | License Scan (one small caveat) | Defined Architecture and Features | . | TODO: . | Contributing | Code of Conduct | Release | Support | CII Badge | Defined Mission and Scope | Roadmap | … | . | . | Historical Rez commits . | Should see a lower number of commits next year, a few of TSC members have recently changed jobs with less Rez exposure | Allan has done a lot of the commits over history, showing historical commitment to project. But shows the dependency on Allan, high “bus factor”, we want to find ways to capture knowledge from Allan, make it more of a community project. | . | MaterialX had a “organizations using” slide. Organizations using rez? At least 4 member companies are known to use Rez, and a lot of smaller companies as well, but no one is “officially” recognizing that they are using Rez. Need a users.md file to keep track. There’s a reason behind that, software management is not seen as a “cool” activity, there’s nothing visual to show. We do have a 2021-ish spreadsheet of companies where someone in the org was willing to submit information about Rez usage. But that spreadsheet doesn’t mean the company is OK to publicize that, or still using Rez. Hoping to make progress on that. | Happy to announce first direct integration: AWS Deadline, put in a feature to allow a Rez resolve to be done at render time, hopefully list gets longer. Flip side to the coin is that since Rez is different from other projects: other projects are libraries being integrated into larger products. Rez is something we package other products with, hundreds / thousands of products, every ASWF project has been Rez-packaged at some point. Most DCCs / plugins / Python packages have been packaged with Rez. There are things that individual companies / products that are anti-patterns, such as requiring sudo, not publishing env vars you can use to control the package. Anyone who has done Rez packaging has come up with these challenges. Happy to talk to vendors about these packaging challenges. | Have been discussing project challenges: . | Difficulties blocking contribution . | Documentation | Niche Domain | Testing / debugging / logging | . | User support | Top Project requests | Dependence on Allan | Attracting Long term contributors | Still early days of our ASWF process | Very little company Support . | Deadline integration was welcome shock, few individuals working for companies have been given permission to contribute to Rez on company time. TSC contributors mostly doing it on their own time. | . | Lull in activity . | 2-3 TSC members have had significant job changes | . | . | Positives . | Community Engagement . | #rez channel has very high contribution, great activity, gives us a solid pulse check as to what’s important to rez community. Our git stats aren’t going so well right now, but the #rez channel shows how important Rez is. | . | Successful companies using | Flexibility | . | Top requested features . | “Provides” | Better Windows shell support . | Good PR on behalf of Co3 that looks promising | . | Better rez-pip . | Converts PyPI packages into Rez packages | . | Cloud package repositories . | Top request, would be a lot of value | . | Some entities have patched Rez to shove that version into Rez, seems promising, but needs to be well architected | Caching-oriented | Robust starter rez recipe set | . | Developments . | Windows Shell Pathing PR | S3/ MongoDB PR + proposal being written | ? | . | Questions: . | Kimball: what about security for a cloud repository? JC: working on this, we don’t have all the answers yet, trying to reach out to as many people as possible. Amazon interested in participating in effort, might be interested in sharing resources. Kimball: have to deal with credentials, how long does it take to update a package when there’s a CVE. JC: not planning a central package repository yet, more a per company repo, but paving the way towards something else. Try to get rid of filesystem dependency, shared filesystem can be a bottleneck and administrative burden. Get rid of that dependency, put packages in S3, if later on want to support more workflows, we can build on that. Stephen: a couple of years ago, there was an idea around Rez and CI working group could have some intersection, maybe concept of CI working group helping package Docker containers, maybe a framework taking ASWF projects and building those as Rez packages. Don’t want to mix Docker and Rez approach, but being able to host Rez versions of ASWF libraries, has concerns around security, but the idea has merit. JF: could Rez be a plugin to Artficatory? JC: trying to build something that’s plugin based, want to still support filesystem approach, but support other tools as well. S3 as a plugin since that’s top request, but could even support an ASWF Artifactory repository, and use in CI | Larry: having a starter set of recipes, do you have a position if it’s worth making those part of Rez, or should projects come with an example Rez package.py for people who don’t want to create their own? Is it useful for Rez to make PRs into projects? Stephen: not sure if it makes projects to support their own package.py, Allan and I have started an effort to push the concept of having a starter set of Rez recipes, a sample implementation of everything that takes you from building IlmBase all the way to building USD. As well what extra you need to do to plug them into Maya, Houdini. Every studio would need to customize to suit their own needs, so not clear it would be portable. Larry: if you saw how studios need to customize the recipe, maybe that’s a concept that could be moved back into the configuration. Stephen: yes, how does this get everyone to a common denominator. A “common core” that people could base their stuff on. One of the big vision goals for Rez from Anders Langland was a prototype idea: a concept of a Rez Install method where packages aren’t just their payload, a package could be used to arbitrarily deploy and install a whole corpus of packages on the fly by reversing the dependency tree and building those on the fly. Part of the concept would be a studio able to deploy an entire setup based on requirements like Nuke / Houdini / Maya version, “I need a VFX 2023 compatible setup”, and it could figure out everything you need. “Provides”, “cloud packages” all lead to the same result. Something to look forward to. | . | . | ASWF Budget Presentation (Andrew Pearce) . | Budget Committee meets on Mondays before TAC, meet and discuss budget, what we’re going to do, where we spend and save money. | We had projected a loss for this year, around $9K under budget this year. We are sitting on a large surplus, Board is considering what to do with that. | Approving sources of funds with banks is tricky, it’s not like we’re going to create a self funded foundation. If there is a project that needs some funding, put together that proposal, bring it to the Board, and there are funds. | One of the reasons this came to a boil was an issue with Slack charges. But if we could use Discord? | Breakdown for 2023 . | LF General and Administrative: 9% | Staff, Travel &amp; Board: 13.8% | IT Infrastructure and Staff: 40% . | Hosting &amp; Infrastructure (DPEL, GitHub Runners, JIRA / Confluence): 6.3% . | $3000/month for DPEL | $1000/month for GitHub premium runners . | JF: I think the cap is $1500/month and potential desire to increase (no GPU usage costs yet) | John: this is where the budget committee comes in, look at the run rate, and adjust accordingly. The budget committee doesn’t approve things, it recommends to the Board. New projects would be presented from the TAC to the Board. | . | $1000/month for other usages (JIRA/Confluence) | These are highly conservative estimates, expecting to be lower | . | LF IT service: 25.7% . | LF Collaboration Services Medium Tier and LF Release Engineering Services Larger Tier | . | Licensing scanning: 2.6% | Technical Community Commons Platform (Slack): 3.3% . | Slack Pro - plan for $32K based on estimates | Future: review with TAC to determine value | . | Diversity and Inclusion: 2.1% | . | Community Engagement &amp; Marketing: 36.9% . | Marketing &amp; Social Media Staff: 10.4% | PR Agency: 5.0% | Marketing Operations and Tooling: 4.2% | Creative Services: 1.2% | Videos and Sizzle Reel: 0.5% | Open Source Days: 7.8% | Open Source Forum: 5.7% | Other Events and Tradeshow Participation: 2.1% | . | . | Kimball: shouldn’t D&amp;I be under Community and Engagement? . | John: some historical background. It ended up there in the spreadsheet, could be moved to another category. To larger point, we’ve noticed over last couple of years that this group is efficient with its funding, it would be interesting exercise for the Board to see if we want to put this in the spend for events. They wanted to provide a reasonable amount of starting funding for D&amp;I and let them decide how they want to address it. Andrew: despite where it appears where it appears in the budget, there’s still a rationalization of how this effort works with other efforts. | Eric: who is using LF IT and Release Engineering? We are critical of Slack, but it’s a small percentage compared to that budget line item. For the projects I participate in, Slack is one of our more valuable assets for collaboration. Eric E: DPEL has been using a lot of the IT RelEng Group. John: if you are asking less use the IT RelEng group? Eric R: is it more about an engineer that’s helping out setting things up? John: a lot of our model here is that we have a set of shared services used across project communities. It tends to ebb and flow over time. When DPEL was starting up, it was using a lot of Andy / RelEng resources. What we try not to do is to keep track hour by hour / itemized billing. At the end of the year, we try to figure out how much of the resources have been used. So more of a flat cost model, but it averages out. All our LF projects work this way, seems to be a pretty clear model from a planning perspective. Eric: it sounds reasonable to me, but would be nice to know what’s covered under that. Andrew: what controls do we have to control those costs. Eric E: for DPEL, it was hard to know what the expectations should be, hard to know how quickly something could be done. What services are we asking for these days, and how do we influence that. Is it mostly new projects coming on, setting up CI? John: also a lot of ongoing items, can probably pull a clear overview of the services. A lot of that lands with newer projects establishing infrastructure, then a bit of maintenance. We try not to look at it as a pure hourly rate, instead understand what the projects are trying to do, and adjust staffing accordingly. | JF: CI WG is a place where a lot of interaction with LF RelEng group happens. Centralized infrastructure. John: would be a good idea to get a one pager with the list of services, also anytime you file an IT support ticket that’s covered by that team. Carol: are there more things we should ask for. | David: adjustments can always be made, refined and improved. It took us a long time to get in front of you. Also what Andrew said at the beginning, besides this operating budget, we also have a surplus, we want to protect it and that it’s there when we need it, but TAC had mentioned many times that there’s need for more engineers, maybe we should hire engineers? At leadership forum, our revenue is matching is budget, we went a bit over but we re-adjusted. This is the budget that matches our revenue at this time. We can also try to generate more revenue, always welcome ideas on that front. When you have needs for your project, don’t hesitate to bring them up, we can consider them. Thank you Andrew for being our Treasurer, Darrin Grant will be the new Treasurer going forward. | Carol: Budget Committee, is that just for the worth, or should someone from the TAC join that? Andrew: don’t know if there are hard rules, so could be a good idea. Involvement from the TAC would be welcome. John: it is set up as a Board committee, so would need a charter change. Carol: it’s just an idea, but it might be a good idea for the TAC to have slightly more involvement, some of our questions come from just not knowing. Kimball: had intended to attend meetings, but hours make it hard to attend. Andrew: could Kimball attend since he’s a Board member? John: yes, that would be fine. Andrew: could adjust time for the timezone. Kimball: or could fine a way to delegate that to my alternate. | Eric: if we’re making decisions about adding projects, we probably should be responsible with understanding the financial capacity to support more projects. John: this is not an exercise of projects have to spend less. A lot of the desire here is to give some insight of how the planning works, the role of the Board is to be of service to the community. If I look at other foundations, the Boards take input from the community, what it needs, and figure out how to make it happen. The take away should definitely not be that projects need to reign in costs. | Kimball: thank you to Andrew for presenting, thank you everyone! | . | . | . ",

Slides link: . | OpenCue History . | OpenCue is an open source render management system | Can submit jobs to the system, have a complex structure with multiple layers of stages, dependencies between jobs, layers, frames, anything in the system. | Job submission, scheduling, monitoring progress | Supports arbitrary commands as part of job submission | Single or multiple frames | Aimed at rendering frames, but supports any kind of work. | Developers originally at Sony Imageworks, open sourced in partnership with Google | Cue3 starts in 2003 at SPI | 2018: OSS development starts | 2019: OSS release, joined ASWF | 2021: Graduated to “adopted” | . | Past milestones . | Oss release | Project governance | Proposed -&gt; incubation -&gt; adopted in ASWF | Docker support, initial packaging | Documentation / sandbox | Limits system for fixed license pools | Python 3 support for all components | Windows support / cross-platform support | Scheduler improvements | . | Past Year . | TSC / developer turnover . | Some churn, new developers | . | M1 support . | Complete dependency refresh: Postgres, gRPC, Docker, PySide 6 (existing dependencies were older and not compatible). That came with some challenges. | User by several of the developers | Affected us quite a bit, put some items on backburner | Developers on M1 MacBooks could not run OpenCue until we did that. | Had to go for a while without an official release. | Change affected release schedule, how can we improve this in the future, continue to do releases decoupled from developer env. | . | Improve release process . | Revamped Docker images and CI workflows . | Don’t use CentOS since EOL | . | Integration testing w/ sandbox setup and test job | Latest PyQt version is not supported until next year (VFX Platform), added compatibility layer to support PySide 5/6 | Still trying to maintain Python 2 compatibility, getting harder over time, less testable, fewer packages available. | Starting to get back on a regular release schedule. | Increase confidence in build / test / releases | Use GHA, uses our sandbox setup, stands up whole OpenCue setup on a single machine, increases confidence in each commit. | . | Improve install and configuration process . | Configuration refactor of all client-side component . | Some was hard coded, some scattered in config files. | Now standardized, much easier to create config files, env vars pointing to config files. Don’t have to dig into the code to change parameters. | . | Configuration guide . | Written, about to be released with new release | . | Packaging script cleanup . | setup.py, improve install process | . | Initial sdists, wheels in internal testing . | Want to get PyPI packages published, made good progress. | Hoping to get those out to users soon. | We need to expand our testing setup to cover Windows / Mac to help verify these wheels. Some of our dependencies (PySide, gRPC) are not pure Python, so wheels are important. | . | Biggest long term project, especially for new users | It’s been a problem area for a long time, lots of moving parts. Someone who just wants to try the system without a multi day deployment process. Starting to get back to this. | Our core dev team doesn’t use the sandbox setup, we all know how the system works, sandbox setup could fall out of data. Now that it’s part of the CI process, can make sure it stays up to date. | . | Contributions: . | Around 2 merged PRs per week, a bit down, work on M1 took time and affected those numbers. | Increased total and active contributors: total contributors 185 (up 15%), active contributors 53 (up 26%). We noticed this in GitHub and email traffic, unaffiliated people from SPI or Google, a positive sign, looks like improved project health and project interest. | . | . | Net Year . | Continue to improve install / config process . | Get PyPI packages out to users | More deb/rpm packages for server-side components | . | Expand testing . | Windows, Mac environments | GUI testing . | Our automated tests use our Python API, job description library, but not doing a lot of testing of GUI components. We have unit tests, but not the same as the full environment | . | . | Blender plugin . | A couple of developers working on this plugin, design and build. Long term project to add more official plugins for major VFX packages. | . | . | Challenges . | Core team is consistent, others rotate in and out: 3-4 consistent TSC members, another 3-4 positions are moving in and out. | Consistent enhancements, less progress on the big stuff. But expanded knowledge sharing, developer diversity. | Maintenance tasks like the M1 issues can derail progress | New minor features, what people want to use in their own environment. It has made it more challenging to work on big new features / architectural features. Current architecture works well now, can be harder to focus on long term issues. | . | Questions . | JF: any uses in non-M&amp;E applications? Brian: we had someone present to TSC, they were doing work on holographic displays, a but outside the realm of VFX, it involved rendering, they were using OpenCue to help prep models for real-time physical holographic displays. But in a “adjacent” area. We might look at expanding to non media use cases. | Kimball: Python 2 support: through end of Avatar 2 we were still supporting VFX Platform 2015, but now we are saying Python 2 is dead. Are people still asking for Python 2 support? Brian: mostly trying to “be nice”, not sure we’ve heard a lot of people clamoring for it. Some fear of dropping that support altogether. It gets harder over time, we drop some pieces of testing, hasn’t yet gotten so painful that we’ve felt to cut it off. Nick: having to support gcc 6 uses up resources, we should conserve our hours for more forward looking work? Larry: We still have shows using older DCC versions… Nick: those should be support platforms, not development platforms. There’s no need for us to modernize features on old platforms. Larry: not everyone has a complete locked pipeline, some of the old shows are expected fixes / new features. It’s a hard decision, we may be able to tear ourselves away from older platforms some time this year. Nick: if we want to put a new feature in openexr, if a show wants it in an older pipeline, they can bring that requirement to us. But lets focus our attention to maximiize our ability to move forward. | Brian: we’re trying to support a wide range of features. VFX Platform helps, but some pieces where it doesn’t help, especially on Windows / Mac where it’s not specified, Java version for instance. Nick: having a version of long term support vs development can help. Brian: having useful guidelines of “we are supporting this for 3 years” can help. Carol: there’s a delay between a VFX Platform release and its adoption. OCIO counts on this approach, we tend to be a bit more aggressive in releasing new features with new requirements with the knowledge that it will take 1-2 years for anyone to pick it up, gives projects the time to finish out and update their dependencies. Nick: I really need OCIO 2, but stuck on 1 right now because shows that need compatibility back to VFX Platform 2019 and Python 2.7. We could have been integrating OCIO 2 for a long time, but haven’t been able to. Larry: all our apps are on OCIO 2, but we have 1.0 configs everywhere since there’s a stray 1.0 only third party tool we can’t trust to read 2.0 config. Carrol: target has been to get libraries updated to 2.0 so that gets integrated and tested, would like if people used the new features, but that’s a longer term goal. | Eric R: the fact that newer versions exist that can’t be used, how does that drive the desire for studios to move to newer VFX Platform years? Larry: we have a show still on Maya 2020, we would have to have specific versions made for that show. Lots of #ifdefs, multiple compiles… Eric: decisions we make as individual projects, how much does that influence studios? Larry: it all flows from the DCCs, we would stay more current if we could, lots of work to Q&amp;A a new DCC major release, which we can’t do during a show. New shows want to pick up new DCC versions, but internal tools need to support all those releases, have to stay compatible with older shows. Kimball: gets even more complicated when collaborating with other studios. Teasing studios with new features / performance improvements, you can incite movement. Getting off topic, maybe gives some guidance on Python 2 deprecation? | Eric R (chat): The opportunity cost of supporting Python 2 is high too - there are a lot of great language features in Python 3.7+ that help velocity a lot | Larry: VFX Industry build matrix spreadsheet | . | . | Project Sandboxing - David / John . | David: follow up on a previous TAC conversation, how do we consider new projects, Gordon framed the issue well. Once we accept a project in the foundation, feels like a one way street. The question is about refining our criteria for projects when they come from the outside when they are not “obvious” projects, projects that are a bit further aways, from other industries, not too many users. (WrangleBot) | We should strengthen our criteria. We didn’t finish that conversation at that time. We may see pictures not directly related to Motion Pictures, we want to be mindful when they come in to accept those that are “worthy”, and what is the definition of “worth”? | John: Early-stage projects that the ASWF TAC believes warrant experimentation. | New projects that are designed to extend one or more TAC projects with functionality or interoperability libraries. | Independent projects that fit the ASWF mission/vision and provide the potential for a novel approach to existing functional areas (or are an attempt to meet an unfulfilled need). | Projects commissioned or sanctioned by the ASWF, including initial code for ASWF Working Group collaborations, and “experimental” projects. | Any project that realistically intends to join ASWF Incubation in the future and wishes to lay the foundations for that. | https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/main/process/lifecycle.md | . | Carol (chat): expanding this: ASWF Project Lifecycle Requirements | David: for WrangleBot, feels like we didn’t end up having enough time to conclude the discussion. What do we do with it? | Larry: feel like a sandbox project is something we’ve already deemed aligned in a way that it should be an ASWF project. What we’re debating is what’s the filter that’s applied before that, what’s allowed to take focus from the organization. | Kimball: we have finite resources in terms of support bandwidth, how do we gauge projects. Carol: what is a sandbox stage project, what are the requirements and expectations. Currently the requirements are pretty well defined, but maybe we should add more details, all the big projects that were “easy” are already in the foundation (not all, but most). Need to add some qualifications as to how we need to look at these projects. | David: also maybe giving ourselves more tools to say respectfully “no”. Sometimes we don’t know how to say “no”. Larry: often the “no” is “not yet”. David: refining those set of answers (“not yet”), need to define those better. | JF: also the issue of hard costs (CI, Slack…). Kimball: not the sole consideration. | Eric E: initially wanted to make sure that key projects crucial to studios didn’t go away. Larry: I agree with that 100%, one exception is that there is a certain kind of project where the neutral forum is crucial to find out if it can get there. The ORI project is like that: if it goes away we would be OK, but it could be great for the future, and the major project members are major members of ASWF, and this is a good match. For other projects, the “risk management for the industry” criterion makes a lot of sense. Kimball: if there are projects where an open standard would benefit the studios that would be a good candidate. OpenAssetIO for instance. Eric R: what does become an ASWF project do for that project, we don’t want to be an ASWF project to be a “stamp of approval”. It creates a neutral ground where we can collaborate. A lot of projects may not benefit from the legal framework / centralization. Not sure if we want to write that down? | Matthew: have had similar discussions in DPEL, how to accept assets, sometimes we have “gut reactions”. Some proposed assets are interesting, for instance an anatomy body, was really interesting, compelling as a data source, but didn’t feel assigned with DPEL mission of a production asset for film &amp; TV, helped to communicate decision back. Helps to drive the decision. Wave: we have an emergency release valve, the USD WG assets repo if it doesn’t fit the DPEL criteria. We don’t have this for software project, a place for project to go. If you get to sandbox stage, doesn’t guarantee that you make it to the next stage. | Larry: but a project can bootstrap as before, just create a GitHub project, it works fine. Wave: right, once it moves into the sandbox, there is no notion of moving on to the next stage. | Eric Enderton: are we talking about which projects need to be let into the sandbox, or leaving the sandbox? Carol: probably both, but we’re looking for more rigor on what projects to let into the sandbox. | Wave: for DPEL, it’s helpful to have something we can point to as to why we didn’t accept the submission. Having the “if this went away, we’d be in trouble” criteria would be useful. | Ben Giles (chat): I think there was a similar “maybe one day” regarding Wayland versus X for the VFX RP. And the reason was something like “need an understanding of colour” and there was a lot of experience with X and colour, while Wayland needs a lot of understanding (and it’s a protocol, not a particular window system). | Eric R: would be helpful to write down these evaluation criteria. “How much is it actually used in the world”, is it something people are already relying on. | Kimball: yes, the next step, codify a set of parameters. Here’s how we judge critical libraries. Eric E: two kinds of “not used”: we may already have an in house tool for that, or we don’t need that. | John: this is a good conversation to have. A lot of foundations get to this point of “we have a lot of projects in, we need to make sense of where we go from here”. CNCF did an exercise in its early days, they were at crossroad where they had Kubernetes project that took a lot of the investment that was happening. Cloud Native world had a much wider range of potential projects, lots of back and forth to define itself, are we a “Kubernetes” foundation? They get 20 projects presented by TAC meeting! (TODO: add CNCF link). What are we trying to do, what’s our role in trying to shepherd this forward. This is our role, did this in conjunction with their Governing Board. How do we know if a project is a “bad idea”? How can we tell that upfront? Maybe we need to define “this is what we are here to do”, is it being used out there is a valid one, but what if it’s a new idea which is not used yet? Also comes down to what is the role of the foundation, it’s fair to say that the initial goal of the foundation was that some important projects needed a home, that was accomplished in first couple of years, what should be the focus next? Is this a forum for new ideas, or for existing, widely used projects? Once you answer that, it becomes easier to answer project proposals. CNFC PRINCIPLES.md | Kimball: in guiding principle of “is this crucial”, sometimes we struggle in reviews for Sci-Tech investigations, if a piece of tech comes not from VFX but film making, for instance a piece of software that tracks on set equipment. How do we write the requirements to look at a piece of software like that, doesn’t help VFX, but helps the motion picture industry. We should continue this discussion on the Slack. John: we can also take some time at next meeting. | . | . ",

Some answers will be very ASWF specific, others will be upstreamed to the project so they can be incorporated. | Want to clean up so we can get to a reasonable V1, but want to keep it as a living document. | JF: background discussion in WG CI meeting notes | . | Review of landscape requirement addition: Initial concept of adding the studio adoption requirement to the landscape #329 . | Has been sitting for a while (from last June) | Wanted to add a bit more rules around what’s included in ASWF Landscape. Want to add a rule for “significant adoption”. We don’t need to discuss this at length here, but would be nice to merge it. | . | Any interested in a demo of new Cinepaint version to the TAC? Robin: Cinepaint is quite old, was originally built in 2000, gradually became unmaintable, has been cleaned up, made 64 bit compatible, Windows version is up, Linux version and Mac versions are imminent. Cleans up everything that was wrong in the code base, not a lot of new features, but want to show it to remind it exists, but also hoping that people might have thoughts on new directions it could take. Now that it has a CMake build system, adding features should be easier. Would be good to have some kind of brainstorm session as to where it could go. It’s basically “Photoshop for image sequences”, similar feature set, and includes a flipbook. Larry: meetings can get pretty packed, so rather than using a TAC meeting for that, maybe announce for that, and make a separate meeting so you can have a longer time, a 10 minute slice may not be enough. Robin: I think having a small slice of the TAC meeting may be better than a separate meeting. John: let’s see how to work it in, might be a few meetings out but should be able to fit it in. | . | Open Source Days/SIGGRAPH . | plan discussion (Emily Olin) | Tentatively scheduled for Sunday, August 6 and Monday, August 7 | Day One: . | Content determined by a CFP and program committee; projects encouraged to apply (similar to Open Source Days) | Held on our own at a hotel near SIGGRAPH. Open to everyone, virtually and in-person. | Historically people have spent the whole day | . | Day Two: . | Virtual town hall presentations before SIGGRAPH | Held as BoFs at the JW Marriot as per of SIGGRAPH | Format can be a meet-up or a presentation | Projects that want to present on Day One can submit for the CFP | Can even use time for a TSC meeting | Within SIGGRAPH, so would need to be registered | . | Robin: did a conference adjacent to SIGRAPH a few years ago, could be successful to have an event just before SIGGRAPH since people are in town. Big decision is what hotel you choose. Picked a hotel near LAX, in BH, on Westside. But these hotels really want you to pay for lunch, which can be expensive. | How does this project work for you with virtual town halls leading up to SIGGRAPH? Carol: yes, sometimes we want to do very specific project updates, don’t need the stage at Open Source Days. If we can have project updates pre-SIGGRAPH in a virtual way, then we can use the BoF on Day 2 for discussion, Q&amp;A, based on the presentation we already did before. So not trying to cram everything into 2 days at SIGGRAPH. | Want to turn this into an annual “tradition” | John: should have more info at next TAC meeting | . | USD Working Group Project Review - Alexander Schwank / Nick Porcino . | Today . | Status overview | Not presenting a charter / goals review | Not discussing recommendations for continuation | Not discussing converting USD WG to a Long Term WG | . | Charter . | Support community in adoption and deployment | Consolidate and share best practices | Provide platform for community discussion around shared issues | Community focussed, not standards or development focussed | . | Sub Working Groups . | Assets . | Chess Set (@pablode) | Documenting Conventions | McUsd (@erich666) | USD/GLTF parity checkers (@beersandrew) | Preview test assets (@hybridherbst) | Composition puzzles (@asblev-nv) | . | Camera . | VES Tech Committee/ASC collaboration on camera attributes | Starting discussion of on-set real-time needs | . | Games . | Collected games industry feedback | Book of USD (Remedy Entertainment) | LOD proposal (Ubisoft) | Very active, new companies joining | What are the needs for USD in games, how to foster adoption | . | MaterialX . | Chess Set | Coordination with MaterialX WG | Gained consensus that MatX is on by default when building USD, small but important decision | . | Web . | Prototype web integrations with WebAssembly | An example of how USD can be used | . | . | Status . | Membership and involvement continues to increase, now over 725 members. Meetings are consistently well attended. | Great diversity in presentations - diversity is a continuing focus | Increased outreach and involvement with other organizations, including ASC and VES | Working with groups such as Remedy Entertainment and The Met to bring best practices and other knowledge to the community | Broadening involvement with wider industry, including GIS, digital twins, simulation, education, exhibition and more | The live forum in zoom is a complement to usd-interest | Place for community to present and discuss newly created USD Proposals workflow | . | Questions? . | Shannon: working on a blog post, would like to include this info so we can publicize what the WGs are, will need fact checking. | In April/May we added a Slack emoji when we surpassed the #random channel subscriber count | David: good work, growth for your group is just starting, hear more and more requests for your sub WGs. Want to make sure that structure of your WG is easy to find on ASWF web site, sub WGs can be a bit harder to find, so we should try to make that easier to discover. John: happy to help with that. | Alex: had 2 months ago kick off meeting on how to restructure the wiki, that’s being worked on. But will take any help that’s offered. | Eric E: very impressive work. | Nick: if there are specific questions about the number and topics of WGs, please forward these via DM or general Slack channel. | . | . | John: we have CI WG review next, then ORI and OSL | Carol: OpenColorIO had applied for Google Season of Docs but didn’t get accepted. Was an interesting experience, may go into it with more experience next year. Only 13 organizations got accepted, very large ones (NumPy, Conda), there will be case studies at the end of the year, so will read those. In doing the application, we had a decent amount of interest from some technical writers, interested in working on projects for us. We’ve talked about budgets, how we as TAC can ask for resources. Would like to fund to the board how to fund some technical writing. Can send our proposal to the TAC channel. Looking for Application Integration documentation: what does a DCC implementation looks like, what’s the minimum feature set, what the UI should look like. Proposals for needs that are outside the core expertise of the developers. David: yes, that’s good, we’ve been talking about how we can make some funds available to projects, if you have a proposal, let’s bring it to the Budget committee, having a concrete proposal would be great. Larry: second year in a row where we have declined to participate in Google Summer of Code, after a year where we had really good experience with that. While the Summer Learning Program is great, it serves a different purpose, and we haven’t seen the students involved with the projects themselves. What do we want to do in the future? The status quo seems to be that we’re not really doing anything to recruit students / interns. Carol: focus this year is the Hackathon, that is targeted this year, still lots to figure out, email to TAC members and companies coming. Have list of questions to run by David / Kimball / John, want to send email to Board and TAC so you can ask your respective companies. Larry: we weren’t sure it was the right match for us. Last year we didn’t get any candidates we liked (partly due to format change). But it leaves a gap in participation to an activity that seemed worth it. Pulling people in helps people and helps the projects. | Eric R: In OTIO we made something similar to that kind of thing - it seems like a useful kind of doc to have around: OpenTimelineIO Application Integrator’s Guide | . | Carol: Summer Learning Program, would love it if you could reach out to organizations you work with if you could let them know about our Summer Learning Program, we have 2 weeks until end of application, we aren’t quite where we want to be, may extend application deadline by a week. Application to ASWF Diversity and Inclusion 2023 Summer Learning Program Anywhere where someone would be interested to learn about technical careers in our industry, this year targeting applicants who identify as LGBTQIA+ There are items in the Wiki https://wiki.aswf.io/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=DIWG&amp;title=Summer+Learning+Program Also would love to find volunteers we already have “enough” but more is always good. | Robin: was volunteer last summer, is call for volunteers out? | Carol: need for LF login is an issue we didn’t know when we switched to Confluence. John: shouldn’t be needed just for viewing, we can fix this. | Carol: if you go to D&amp;I from ASWF site, you’ll find our new landing page, and links to the Wiki. Also have done 2 blog posts about this, released one today: Reflections on the Summer Learning Program from Irina Wang | Carol: Get a lot of good feedback from blog posts. Reached out to my Alma Mater, got some students to apply. And followed up with them today. | John: this should work now: Diversity and Inclusion Working Group Home | Gary (chat): also interested in “publicizing” our OpenFX wiki | Have collaborated with Women in Animation program | Carol: will reach out to volunteers when the application deadline is done. The full schedule is on the wiki. | John: fixed a couple of other groups which didn’t have their Wiki publicly visible | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Open Source / SIGGRAPH (Emily Olin) . | Not a huge update from 2 weeks ago | Open Source Days will be Sunday, at the JW Marriot, but outside SIGGRAPH, free and open | Will be a CFP, and a program committee | Series of virtual town halls for projects in weeks leading up to SIGGRAPH, will be recorded and put on YouTube. Can present to community, and can have bigger Q&amp;A later on | Flexible, can be scheduled based on availability | BoFs at SIGGRAPH for projects who want it, will need registration | If we do it Monday and Tuesday, can do it at Convention Center | Meetup or Presentation style, will still be part of Open Source Days but separate | Link to spreadsheet that projects need to fill if they are interested: . | Virtual Town Hall Y/N | BoF Y/N | Meetup or Presentation | Session Description (3-4 sentences)/ Main Contact-Speaker | Expected Attendance (booking room for 75 person) | Targeting 1H, but can combine if you think you can’t fill 1H (two WGs for instance) | . | Ken: we submitted a proposal for a course on OpenVDB, waiting to hear back, so we don’t know if we want a timeslot based on that. Don’t know when we find out, probably 1 or 2 weeks from now. Emily: probably worth filling the info so we can reserve the timeslot, can always forfeit it. | Emily: will send link out to every project to fill, should be quick | SIGGRAPH is technically allowing recording, we don’t think recording BoFs gives a good experience, which is why we prefer the virtual Town Halls. No “virtual” option. There will be a microphone and a project, but no plan on recording. But if someone from the TSC needs to join remotely, can put that up on a projector, but that’s not “official” | Robin (chat): Do you want to add Cinepaint to your grid? I would host a session, but we’re not in your list. Carol: It’s only foundation projects on the list right now it looks like. I’d imagine you could submit a proposal for a talk at open source days! Will let Emily confirm of course. Emily: Thanks Carol! Yes, this is just for Foundation projects, but I’d encourage you to submit for the Open Source Day CFP once its live | . | OpenImageIO ASWF Submission Proposal (Larry Gritz) . | What is it? . | Make it easy to read / write manipulate image files of any image file format relevant to VFX / animation via a format-agnostic API | . | Core PAI . | ImageInput / ImageOutput: Generic API for reading / writing lots of image formats, hiding format-specific details . | Read individuals scanlines, tiles, or whole ile | Metadata | Data type conversions | . | Implementations for all the formats important to VFX . | Some use native libraries | Other from scratch | . | . | Higher level APIs . | ImageBuf: whole-image, memory-managed, no explicit I/O . | Iterators to traverse pixels for low-level operations | . | ImageBufAlgo: lots and lots of image processing functions . | Examples: crop, color convert, resize, image math, text overlay, channel shuffle | . | ImageCache: full memory and file handle virtualization . | Handles tens of thousands of “open” files, multiple TB of pixel data | . | TextureSystem: filtered texture lookup | . | And the rest . | Python bindings | Several other specialized command line utilities . | Oiiotool… | . | . | Ecosystem role . | Used by approximately every animation/VFX studio . | Command line and Python bindings for scripting image processing | ingest/conform, format or data type conversion, color space conversion, make slates, simple command line compositing… | C++/Python APIs for all basic image reading and writing in studio apps | . | Used inside most large DCC apps, renderers… | Dependency of OSL, MaterialX, OCIO, USD, Gaffer… | Depends on OpenEXR, OCIO OpenVDB | Included in most Linux distros, Homebrew, VcPkg | . | History / Popularity . | Open source since 2008 (BSD license) . | One of the oldest VFX-specific open source libraries | . | Not officially sponsored by any company | 190+ contributors | 1600+ GitHub stars, 500+ forks | This week is OIIO’s 15th birthday | . | The problem . | Over the years, criticality to the industry has grown steadily | Significant support by the industry has plateaued or shrunk . | Lots of varied small contributions, little steady involvement or ownership | Understandable - it is great, production solid, and seems to run itself | . | Too much is bottlenecked on one person . | Not my only code project; code projects are not my full time job; job is not my whole life | . | It’s not a crisis yet, but it’s a risk I think about a lot | It is already the case that things fall through the cracks | . | What could OIIO do with real support? . | Better Windows support + pre-built binaries | Python wheels / PyPI install | Long overdue overhaul of camera raw and movie file support | GPU port of TextureSystem (and other GPU acceleration) | Rust and C bindings | (each of those things could use an “owner”) | The sky’s the limit - what else can we do together? | . | Danger / Please for help . | Bad outcome: . | LG still does almost everything | But now burdened with an additional meeting and organizational hoops | And a TSC full of people asking for things | . | Proposal acceptance MUST include: . | TSC that is a majority doers, not just advisors | Vibrant steady contributor community | “Owners” of several code areas / topics | Major stakeholder companies to step up | Role models: OpenColorIO, MaterialX | . | . | Discussion . | Jean-Christophe (chat): Python wheels were in progress last year, but I got stuck on licensing questions (OIIO has a LOT of dependencies and they all have different licenses) | Scott (chat): For things like the GPU texture support, I feel like we should communicate with consumers of OIIO (such as Blender with Cycles, Autodesk with Arnold, Pixar with RenderMan, etc) to either put resources in, or get some of their contacts (for example, Nvidia, AMD, Apple) to help add support. | Eric (chat); NVIDIA already talking about OIIO contributions … Don’t know yet how much resources I’ll be able to shake loose. JT (chat): Blender, from my experience as an external community dev, shies away from contributing directly and extensively to almost all used libraries other than what they use it for and providing PRs for patches very specific to blender usage. They may consider something different but historically the focus on their “own way.” | JF: any volunteers yet? Larry: there are people I can think of, it’s been 1.5 weeks since I put out the application, posted also on OIIO list, but haven’t really heard anything concrete. Don’t want to say the project is not sustainable, but it can’t be all it can be. Need people to think about what resources they can put in. Not quite the “building on fire” call, but not sure the project is secure going forward. | Robin: how could I help? Larry: I need several people to come forward. I have 4-5-6 different areas that could use someone with expertise in that area and take responsibility and can put some time into it. And maybe a few more people who can help part time, issue triage, answering questions, learning enough to spread expertise around. Which would help free me up for other issues, since I have to coordinate every release, track down issues, deal with CVEs… If someone could come forward and say “I’ll take care of Windows”, or “I’ll take care of PyPI”… But I don’t want to be too prescriptive. Robin: I can take care of Windows C++ | Carol: really good to see, from a perspective of being honest, from outside perspective, people don’t understand all that’s needed to keep OIIO running. ASWF brings to light a lot of things happening in those projects, making it more public. I think that getting accepted in foundation is good first step regardless. It might take a bit of time, from OCIO perspective, we talk how we can support other projects, where we can bring expertise. Bringing light within OCIO channels. LG: we’ve had really good collaboration with OCIO, a lot of what OIIO does is wrap OCIO, the OCIO project is very responsive to OIIO user requests. New functionality appears in OCIO which is awesome. Would love to have a color expert make smart choices. Carol: yes, we can talk about that, we have resources, we can move some resources to OIIO for a bit / long term. | Jonathan: so many of concerns you bring up resonate with other projects. OIIO has a really good chance of receiving net benefit from joining ASWF, has a large code surface, and people who aren’t deep in an area of expertise may be able to contribute, whereas people might be more scared of contributing to OSL due to lack of knowledge about PBR. I can volunteer to try to encourage people at ILM to work on OIIO. LG: I need to do that at Imageworks as well, where it is used a lot. I also need to make people more comfortable to contribute. | Wave: I could recruit people at Apple as well. GPU accelerated paths make it interesting to engineers, but if you have a TSC with a bunch of people with a bunch of engineers… There might be some staged movement through the process, “toss it over the fence” to ASWF, get a temporary group of TSC people who may not be able to write code but at least advocate for it and try to recruit contributors. Also on the vendor side. | LG: I’m OK with that plan of “tossing it over the fence” | Wave: I wasn’t clear that “OIIO is just Larry!”. LG: it’s not just me! Wave: but it’s not in ASWF, and not a Sony project. | Gordon: if you look at industry challenges when we set up ASWF, feels like a poster child for this purpose, this shouldn’t be Larry’s problem, it should be our (the TAC)’s problem. Larry shouldn’t have to be rattling cages. I support bringing it in, as a TAC we should be reaching out to our organizations, findS the people who would benefit from new features. I love that you bring this up, and thanks for the overview of the project. | Sean: Intel would like to get involved, especially in GPU support, and can get resources | Kimball: is there anything we need to know? What is the phase we would accept at? Is there a motion for a vote? Wave: if Larry can share those slates, I would be happy to take that back to some people at Apple, and try to get some resources. LG: I trust that you have all gotten the point and that this is not a “hollow” vote. I trust the TAC to follow through, but it can’t stop with the vote. | David: it is a good move for everyone to talk about OpenImageIO within our companies, having the slide deck is good, we should do it now, as we look to bring in OIIO. There will be marketing when it’s adopted, but we need to make sure people don’t think just because it’s adopted, “it’s taken care of”. LG: will send out the link. Kimball: will reach out to people at WETA. Larry: I know people at Animal Logic are working on. | LG: I have a semi-optional CLA, but I can decide for small things to wave it, that has helped, sometimes the CLA can stand in the way. Having the same CLA as ASWF administered through EasyCLA should take care of that. Open question for the TSC / TAC, should the question keep the CLA, some people who would contribute see it as a hindrance, on the other hand, someone else told me recently that some organizations might be more comfortable if everyone contributing uses the same CLA. Not sure if it helps or hurts, I put it in place 15 years ago, but it’s not come up since. Changing to ASWF CLA is a time to revisit this, consult with the stakeholders. There can always be bureaucratic headaches, and we lose contributions due to that, not unique to this project. Part of the work of ASWF is to normalize contributions from our companies, people should have wide latitude to improve the projects our companies rely upon. | Kimball: Larry to circulate slide deck, we will look at it, reconvene in 2 weeks to complete. | Link to email containing slide deck PDF | . | . | Hackathon (Carol) . | Put a document together | Calling it “Dev Day” (working title), got some feedback about some possible stigma around “hackathon”, competition aspect that we’re not aiming for. | The doc lays out what this event tries to solve, important to keep at a scale we can manage as a relatively small foundation. Make it beneficial to the people who participate in it, not put too much burden on our projects to do, since it will be a bunch of work. | Some thoughts around time commitment | List of questions we need feedback on, haven’t done something like that before, can we make something like this happen | I need people to reach out to your companies, people who run software depts, pipeline depts, is this something you would be interested in. | A couple of initial outreach to companies, pretty positive responses so far, but we want to make it a first, good experiment. Would like to get opinions from member companies as to whether they would want to participate and put resources in. | You may not be the ones making those decisions, and is this what you thought a “hackathon” would be | David: “Dev Days” sounds better than hackathon | Kimball: do we have a short statement of goal for dev days? | Carol: no, since I think it should come out of this group. Have a hard time to come up with a single thing since it’s multi faceted. A goal is specifically not to get great code contributions for our project, at least not initially. | Kimball: it’s one thing to say “do we want to do a bug squash day”, but if we are looking for new ideas, that’s different? Larry: may want to find juniors who haven’t made contributions before, and show them that it’s not that scary. And cut red tape in organizations by having a bunch of people working at once. Also as career benefits, it’s the same people on the TSCs, most senior people in 20 years. Where’s the next generation coming from? There’s a lot of younger engineers who haven’t contributed to these projects. | Carol: I’ll put a TL;DR at top of document to summarize this. | Eric: the mission statement is there: get junior people in the industry to contribute for the first time. | Larry: being involved in these ASWF projects is touching something that’s used in all projects in all studios, gives you a skill in demand, networking with senior people, there are so many benefits career wise. How many people have won Sci-Tech awards for these projects. Junior people are perfectly able to get involved. | Carol: there is a large, steep learning curve for these projects, and requires a general idea of how these projects are used, you have to have been exposed to how these projects are used in the industry, instead of “coming in cold”. (contrast with Google GSoC). Hopefully can find some longer contributors with a baseline knowledge of how pipeline / animation / … works. Every member company doesn’t have the same types of resources, but if you have junior engineers, they could participate. Won’t target as much companies on the DCC side that might have junior engineers. | Carol: Please comment on the document, if this is interesting, the entire TAC will need to participate, this is not a D&amp;I initiative, it is a TAC initiative. Larry: there is a diversity component to expand the tiny core working on these projects. Carol: D&amp;I WG can help with that component, but cannot run the whole project. | Deadline for comments / TAC member feedback is 2 weeks (not necessarily commitment from your company yet, that’s a bit too short timeframe). | . | Robin: decision on Cinepaint presentation? . | Carol: we thought we would try to find a slot in an upcoming meeting? But we haven’t decided yet. | . | . ",

Good good feedback, but please feel free to add anything else to the document. Maybe we have time at the end of the meeting to discuss live? Unless someone has something urgent to ask? | Kimball: OK, sounds good. Do you feel you have the steps forward? Carol: I want everybody’s input, so if you have opinions, put them in the doc or send to me directly. Also if we greenlight and get enough interest, will need a second person from the TAC or two to help me run this. Will need someone to help co-run this, so think about whether you are interested. Have a couple of people from D&amp;I working group committed to help. So people from TAC in conduction with D&amp;I group and LF folks. | . | . | Diagram of the creative lifecycle of a production (Ben Schofield) . | OpenTimelineIO Context for creatives slideset | OpenTimelineIO : Context for Creatives . | Use cases &amp; product roadmaps | . | Project adoption . | Ranked by software maturity | Needs more context for usage in creative community | . | OpenTimelineIO . | Engineering focus | Limited use cases in documentation | Signs of wider adoption . | Sightings in the wild | Product… | . | . | Content lifecycle . | Creative toolsets | Common workflows | Identify friction | Everyone can identify points of friction within these workflows | . | Trying to collate more use cases so we can remove more friction. Expand the list in RTD from 3 use cases to other cases where people are trying to use. | Some examples from #opentimelineio Slack, vendors starting to talk about how to incorporate OTIO in their products | Content lifecycle graph, where do these projects fit | Current focus on exchange of information between editors and VFX, and review process | People starting to build these links, for instance Rohit from BMD put something out there, spoke to NIgel at The Foundry. We’re starting to get interactions between projects and within product families. | Also a comment from BorisFX: usage within Netflix, editing and mastering using AAF for interchange results in data lost. “Thousands of dollars and workdays lost” | Trying to extract some use cases, build on them so we can explain them as an actual problem someone has today, and whether we can address with OTIO. | Get product roadmaps from vendors, how do those things work together. | Next steps . | Collate us case in standard template | Identify business value to creatives | Confirm product interactions and roadmap | ASWF ecosystem project interactions | OTher industry initiatives: OSVP (camera metadata), IMF . | Camera metadata is very valuable to VFX projects, lots of work going on there | IMF: distribution format, MXF is very good at doing video, audio and subtitle, but not great for other time driven metadata. An initiative on how to extend subtitle information and use it to carry other metadata, could be useful for advertising as well. | . | . | Meeting at NAB between vendors to share what they are doing | Want to get vendors to contribute. Vendors need to step forward, say how our products are using ASWF projects, do plug fests to validate interoperability. Also how do ASWF projects interact with each other. | Trying to get ideas from people, get people this out outside of the narrow group of code contributors, get wider adoption within industry. | Joshua: thank you for initiating this, we’re engineering focussed, looking at specific solutions, but we can’t answer business questions. Very useful, to other projects as well. | Ben: looking for other examples. | John: is there an existing WG working on this, or is this ad hoc at events. Ben: doing this within context of OTIO group, Josh has given me “airtime” on TSC, have had other individuals contributing ideas. Start of a journey, trying to create a book of these templates, share those out, and bring those to a later meeting. John: these are fantastic, we all know what these projects do, but people outside this “room”, not always. Where to projects fit in, what are they “competing” against…. This is fantastic, and we can definitely from our side help to support this, maybe have some kind of white paper, talk about the modern content lifecycle is as relates to open source. | Ben: helping NBCU with cloud workflows, how do you persuade the creative teams to try something new, one of the levers is having a big time or cost savings. As well as the technical function, the business need needs to be emphasized to drive adoption. | Carol: if we’re starting to add other ASWF projects into something like that, we may be surprised as what’s already integrated in software: OCIO, OSL… May want to expand the “VFX” box into all the intermediate steps. We can show people how all the ASWF projects fit into the lifecycle of content production, how many times they are used already, and opportunities for adoption. People may not realize what they are already using, Sometimes it becomes so common place they don’t realize it’s already in use. | Eric: at the NAB meeting, we talked about how OTIO may be growing in the future, for instant moving color metadata. We don’t plan to reinvent the work done by other projects, but how can we work seamlessly with other projects like OCIO. | Josh: show how projects can collaborate and interoperate. For instance color info in OpenEXR, not always clear how they interact. Documenting how things are already done, here’s how things have improved at a studio, can generate blog posts / white papers to show success stories. And show how non-VFX films may already be using these workflows, games, TV, lots of opportunities for ASWF projects to be used. Not trying to make a “sales pitch”, but it kind of is. We need to communicate the value of these projects in the right vocabulary. How much to document what’s been done, vs evangelize what could be done. | Ben: we should count any successes we can measure. Pushback is always “what I’m doing is already working”, but we can show how it can be done more efficiently. Eric: what people are doing with it, and what is more speculative in the future. But also the example from BorisFX: we want OTIO support and this is why. People who are asking for OTIO explicitly to solve a specific problem. | Kimball: we can use these maps to discover gaps where we don’t have a good answer, for instance a piece of metadata we can’t carry across. | Ben: will share the slides, want to keep the charts simple. John: could we place every ASWF project on this lifecycle? Carol: we have to split out and get more detailed for the VFX part, a lot of our projects are VFX specific and happen in specific steps of the VFX pipeline. This covers live action production, should we have a separate use case for animation? John: the big arrows at the top of the chart are very general, each box could be expanded. | Ben: it’s useful to try to map our projects to put them into context. Kimball: don’t want to weigh down the diagrams, but interchange and archival are a good part of the story since the code is open. | Eric: should OTIO become the blessed archival format has been discussed, some other approaches have already been used for that, but OTIO make sense. Ben: there’s the “raw” archive of WIPs, but also the final deliverable archive. Ideally you don’t want to lose anything. | Carol: archival also being discussed within the Academy group discussing consolidated archives. Kimball: we can point at ACES where they standardized as subset of EXR. | Eric E: Transfer between studios is also something that goes on and open standards are important to that. | Ben: have been working with MovieLabs folks for 15 years on related topics. | Ben: thank you everyone, will carry on with this effort. Joshua: will share more use case diagrams from our studio. This will be really useful | Show the ubiquity of ASWF documents. Eric R: we’re at a phase with OTIO where a bunch of vendors are starting to adopt us, there’s a lot of questions “how are people exactly using OTIO”, every vendor may not be familiar with every workflow. Some surprise at things like programmatically building timelines for instance. Creating more clarity has been useful for vendors, and they keep asking for me. | Eric E: I’m hearing 3 different motivations. 1- explain to consumers of OTIO what they might do with it. 2- explaining to vendors how customers want to use it. 3- explaining what ASWF projects are good for in general, and how it can save you money | Carol: non engineers / industry people would be the target. John: this is where people should put engineers on projects, this is a way that helps make it clear where people add value. People outside our group may not know the value of our projects, or may have their own in-house solution. | Carol: key element on how you onboard new project contributors, when people start they may not have the context of what the project is supposed to do. You can understand the code, but you may not understand the film or vfx pipeline. | Joshua: some companies / organizations have consulting dollars they could use to implement specific features | John: we have models in other industries, automotive industry had vendor / consumer model, they’ve developed new ones to help contributions | Eric: we should start small and build up. “Educating the whole world” is a big ask. Let’s concentrate first on specific use cases. | Kimball: map of Weta’s pipeline is interesting spaghetti. Joshua: would love to be able to share ours as well. Eric E: Could be a good DigiPro talk. | . | Project Sandboxing and how we scope to our principles . | John: this came out of the the presentation a few weeks ago, the project didn’t have a lot of good fit at the sandbox level. What is the right sort of ingredients one would look at for a good sandbox project. Start to go down that road, the project may not have everything in place, but if they have a lot of the right ingredients, can be a good place to start. | Should we look at what it means to be a sandbox project, not so much the technical requirements, but the fit within the foundation. | Kimball: how do we make a document that gives people guidance as to what type of project we are looking for. | Kimball: for instance OIIO was a “no brainer”. Joshua: in DPEL, we made a wishlist we were hoping people would contribute, “wish there was a dataset for X-Y-Z”. So should we have a wishlist of “what we wish there was an open source solution for”. Or help identify projects that could become problems. Matthew L: where there are gaps of missing open source projects we could use. John: like a “good first issue” tag. Matthew Low: and where does it fit in this ecosystem, and the types of workflows we want to support. John: it’s not intended that a project comes in that’s competitive to another, don’t want one that’s in “competition”, so we want to fill gaps. Joshua: it’s fine if there’s some overlap, we have different playback tools? Not necessarily need to be a hard showstopper. John: some foundations do it both ways, some want minimal overlap, others are ok with competitive projects. What is the tolerance the group has for that. Larry: case by case basis, if another image format came in, we wound’t argue we already have OpenEXR. But if it’s an exact use case duplication, we may not want another color management system. We would “know it when we see it”. Carol: OpenAssetIO was a clear need that solved something that didn’t exist and needed to be solved. Or OIIO which is already widely adopted. Larry: developer resources are limited, there are only so many color scientists we can put on improving projects! There are other projects where you aren’t competing for resources. | Gordon: when we looked at Review&amp;Playback, are we about to “knight” one of these, same for Package Management. It all comes back to how we set this foundation up, what’s in the best interest of open source for our industry. We can have 2 systems that are worth supporting, in other cases it would be dilution of effort. And in other cases we may be able to bring two projects together. It would be good for us to document how we need to assess it. At Autodesk open source project, not necessarily a binary test, answers tend to be a paragraph. Let’s understand why we are doing this, as opposed to just being “a home for a bunch of projects”. Eric E: it’s an investment / gamble, there’s a big component of “you know when you see it”. | JF: we should document why we would and would not accept a project. | John: This all sounds like the beginning of a document. Larry: still grappling with what it means to be a sandbox project. Difference between sandbox and incubating project should not be level of adoption. Sandbox means “it’s not done yet”, but it needs some time to grow. I don’t see sandbox as a “done” project that’s not as popular yet, that’s a “no”, not a “sandbox”. ORI is the perfect sandbox project, we know we want to build something, we need a place to build it, that’s the sandbox use case. But a project that’s coming in with little use, that’s not the use case. John: other foundations look at “is this project solving a problem that needs to be solved, and would the resources of this foundation help solve these problems”. | Gordon: we should document the success criteria to make it out of the sandbox phase, we may already have that in our template? Eric E: a criterion for this specific project? Gordon: yes, if we make a project a sandbox, we should document what would be needed to exit that stage. Eric E: is it allowed to fail? Incubation projects rarely fail, but sandbox projects could fail, that’s OK? Larry: we typically bring in foundational, long standing projects as incubating, just to fill the checklist… But I like the “too big to fail” aspect: that’s a good reason to accept a project, project is too important to the industry to allow it to fail. | John: would the ASWF have the resources to make it not fail. | Gordon: having criteria in order is useful, “too big to fail” is how we got ASWF together in the first place. Example was the NTP protocol. We can have other criteria, but that’s one we need to look at. | John: this is how I see other projects do this. Building the infrastructure for the project to be successful, but how can the TAC can have more of a guiding hand to help. Sandbox stage is where you try to get your stuff together. “Too big to fail” helps to make it successful | John: action item to take meeting notes and turn into an official document. | . | . ",

John: have other projects that use GitHub issues, can use tags to add items to agenda. The copy-n-paste can be improved on. | Eric: we could just ditch the formatting | JF: periodic reminder on the #tac channel a few days before the meeting, giving time for people to add agenda items | John: does the process to request agenda items? Eric: is there a process outside of typing in the agenda? Carol: not sure of the process, normally I just add in something or ask John / Kimball? Eric: don’t mind reaching out. John: don’t want to be the blocker. JF: open / documented process is good. | Kimball: better than making it up 5 minutes before the meeting starts! | . | Emily: CFP for Open Source Days is now open, talks don’t need to tie directly to ASWF, but should have an Open Source Angle. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions. | Robin: what kinds of things are you watching for? I have a few ideas, for instance I could present on some of my projects (Cinepaint, CMaker, C security), don’t know if any of these could be of interest. | Emily: def looking at newer / emerging topics, the program committee will review. Encourage to submit more than one, the program committee will review. Robin: any specific theme this year to help framing? Emily: no overarching team, the audience will be technical. Robin: that helps, Thank You! | Kimball: adjacent to SIGGRAPH, so will draw some of that audience. | David: we want to recognize that Open Source Forum worked quite well, even if the presentations were more general, they were diversified, we kept the audience of our audience from our audience for the whole duration, got really good feedback. Looking for presentations on the topic of Open Source. The presentation from Autodesk on how they open sourced RV was a highlight, hit many points in what we want to do and develop, so an experience in a company like Autodesk, something very new (touching Open Source to that level), the honest account of all the milestones they went through, the difficulties, but how it worked out in the end, that was really great.

Pushing people towards virtual town hall, the BoF can be a follow on, can be more in depth, doesn’t need to be the same content. | Emily: CFP is open until next Friday. If you want to submit a talk for the main day, please submit and share with your colleagues. Doesn’t have to be ASWF related, but should be open source related. | Larry: which day is main event vs bof? Emily: Main open source day is Sunday, Bofs are Monday / Tuesday, working with SIGGRAPH to have the BoFs at the convention center, but not confirmed yet. | . | Emily: if you are colleagues in London, we are doing a Beers of a Feather on June 6th, hosted by Foundry, if you know junior people you want to get involved, this is a good opportunity to meet the community. TODO: add link | Emily: starting to think about keynote speaker, what would be topics you would want to hear about, or any speakers at other events that you really enjoyed. David: Andrew Glassner was really good at Open Source forum, he had a topic on AI. Any good topics emerging right now? David: AI has become even more of a hot topic since Andrew Glassner presentation. Any new efforts on AI in your companies? So if you have anything in that field. Kimball: a really good talk at CPPcon was Herb Sutter’s talk on CPPNext, how yo have a C++ that’s secure and fast. Carol: I would prefer to pick a speaker that’s good for our organization rather than a good topic, I feel the topic is less important than a good speaker. Larry: would rather have someone talk about AI issues in VFX studios rather than a more general talk. Kimball: think about that, send ideas to Emily. | Cinepaint Update (Robin Rowe) . | Since 2002, it had existed under a different name before I arrived. | Someone in this group I met at in person event was working on a generative AI for image sequences, but don’t remember who it was? Does anyone remember / could be someone who could present? | Open Source High Fidelity Image Editing . | Flipbook playback with Onion Skinning | . | Was writing the graphics column in Linux Journal, ran across Cinepaint being used on Scooby Doo, used for dust busting, wire removal. Pretty mechanical, but advances frame by frame quickly. | UI looks a fair amount like Photoshop, does the things you expect a Photoshop like tool to do, but supported HDR images from the start. | Used in Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, several more, mostly for dust busting (back when we shot film) | CinePaint Overview . | HDR 2D painting features, free alternative to Photoshop | Forked from orphaned Film Gimp, renamed CinePaint in 2002 | Sony (Stuart Little) and ILM contributed patches | Single codebase POSIX-style C/C++ for Linux, Windows, macOS | Cmake build system replaced GIMP automake framework | 64-bit GTK1 GUI library, extensive GUI sample code | … | . | CinePaint Operating Systems . | CinePaint for Linux | CinePaint for Windows, uses libunistd for Linux POSIX API, builds natively in Microsoft Visual Studio, not with mingw gcc | CinePaint for macOS, GTK1 64-bit Cocoa port in development to replace obsolete 32-bit Carbon port | CinePaint for FreeBSD, untried, should work | CinePaint for Android, port of GTK1 Android untested | CinePaint for iOS, no work yet | . | CinePaint Future . | SoundSweep audio editor contributed by Pixar, Pro Tools alternative | Live chat with desktop sharing, collaboration, i18n, help system | Storyboards, Cartoons, Toon Boom and Storyboard Pro alternative | Comics with Generative AI, Clip Studio Paint Pro alternative | Slide shows, PowerPoint alternative | GUI mock-ups, Invision and Figma alternative | Render 3D models as objects in 2D layers | Game engine with SOUTH PARK style animation, Flash alternative | Manage projects, Bill of Materials, scheduling and costing | Online marketplace for hiring photographers and artists | . | CinePaint Project Next Steps . | Cinepaint.org website overhaul | CinePaint book: CinePaint Users Guide in first draft | Interactive localization, about 20 languages that existed before, but are now somewhat broken. | CinePaint users gallery . | Show off what people have done | . | Kickstarter campaign . | Sponsorship support | . | . | Main reason to present is if people have suggestions of how it could be done better. People think it was “gone”, trying to find best ways to bring it back. Mission has changed, it was used for dust busting in the past but that’s gone. | JF: what about comparison with Krita? Robin: the sequence based support makes it quite difference. I am asked whether you could merge back into GIMP? These projects are not very collaborative. The film industry initially paid for “Film Gimp”, but this was abandoned by the GIMP community, which disliked the effort. On the Krita side, I don’t necessarily pay that much attention to the other open source projects, more to PhotoShop. In the past would donate to GIMP plugins, but GIMP wouldn’t accept a plugin contribution. It’s unfortunate that even in free software, there’s egos, competitiveness. I don’t see CinePaint as a profit project. | Question to the team: is this a good idea? Do you want to see CinePaint come back? Do people still remember it? Deke: I worked at R&amp;H and used CinePaint: a lot of work isn’t done the same way, paint is done with 3D, OCIO, so anything that works outside of that, Substance Painter was an issue until they added OCIO. At DD we compile all our own software, we didn’t get a request for it. Kimball: lack of OCIO is a big deal in the industry. People’s way of working has changed a lot since CinePaint was predominant. Not sure how to bridge that gap? Deke: everyone is talking about generative AI? Robin: may happen in a year or so, looking at open source. But depends on funding a lot, since I’m doing everything myself, makes everything quite slow. Carol: used Cinepaint in college, but haven’t used it professionally. If you want to give it new life, find a niche it does that everything else doesn’t do, have to give people a reason to use the tool instead of something else. Pipeline integration is often the barrier to entry, as well as OpenEXR and OCIO integration. Some interesting things to do: meaningful support for HDR in a way that interacts with the OS (Windows, macOS, hard to do on Linux). Make paint tools work in the context of HDR, happy to talk to you offline as to what the current limitations of tools are. For instance on a macOS laptop, can view HDR images to some degree, making the application use with that display, and make it possible to control it, don’t want it to do something you don’t know what it’s doing. | . | .

It allows plugins (shared libraries) to interface with host applications, giving artists thousands of new tools and capabilities. It was created in 2004, and has evolved to become an industry standard under the ASWF | First Year under ASWF, joined around SIGGRAPH 2022 | Organization Status . | Stats: . | Contributors . | 6-8 people attend every TSC, sometimes we get 10-12 | Only 3 github committers, and 4-6 reviewers, need more! | . | Github users: 483 clones, 334 unique cloners (first fortnight of June 2023) | GitHub visitors: 594 views, 102 unique visitors | (no website stats currently) | Looking at a new Wordpress based website, existing was Ruby on Rails, nobody could update it, snapshotted it and made a static version, it looks like it’s from the 90s.

Right now Slack is mostly just meeting updates | . | Updates . | Old Association is now dissolved | Github is now migrated under AcademySoftwareFoundation | New website in progress (expecting design drafts this month, go live by SIGGRAPH) | Copyrights and IP all updated | New logo | . | Discussion . | We are starting to move much faster than we did pre-ASWF. Monthly meetings help a lot, and the ASWF’s resources really help offload the admin work, as well as helping set direction and give us goals to reach for | But we’d like to go even faster if we can | We will always be slower than some open source projects because we have major commercial users, and because OpenFX is a mature plugin standard, so we need to get buy-in from both shots and plugins before committing a change to the standard. But we can do better around release engineering and support libs. | We’re trying to pull people together and get consensus on how to extend OpenFX both into new areas and deeper into existing use cases, to ensure OpenFX is the standard for visual effects for many years | Color management is a great case study: being part of ASWF has enabled us to work closely with OCIO to define how effects and host apps should communicate color information (break the assumption that image buffers are just “linear” or “video”). We hope to do the same thing with OTIO to help transport effect definitions in timelines in a portable way. | . | Project Status . | Tech . | GPU support for Metal, and OpenCL in addition to CUDA: complete (98%).

We’re friendly, we’re open, anyone can write an OpenFX plugin in a day, and it works on a dozen host applications. Would love to communicate this excitement, get more people on board. | More git and github expertise among the TSC | Help to support our example plugins, and plugin and host support libs. We do a good job of managing the standard, but we (the TSC) sometimes forget about the sample code, important to new users. Making a project to get the support libs modernized, showing off all the latest features. Would be great to have some other people interested in helping with that. | Better documentation of host feature support. OpenFX is a “self describing” API, plugins can query at runtime what host supports, but that hasn’t been written down anywhere. Encouraging host developers to fill in chart on Wiki. | . | Ideas . | Would folks be interested in ASWF open source events at NAB or IBC? . | Since we’re in the 2D post space, most of our users and contributors are more likely to attend NAB than SIGGRAPH. Joshua: OTIO is also has a lot of people who tend to attend NAB. Also we’re interested in the FX schemas, especially now that Resolve supports OTIO, and is proposing metadata for FX. | Could we create a job board to match projects with developers? We sometimes get requests on our Discord “is there anyone available to write a plugin”? Do other projects have a job board? Wave: in DPEL we have a wishlist of assets we’d like to have. Carol: OCIO has both NAB and job board interest. Wave: no central place to go, giving a talk about open source at Apple, a big question is “how can I help”? Would be good to have some kind of coordinate list of ASWF needs for contributions that could be pointed to. | Carol: how do we get people who are interested in contributing pointed to the right place. Dovetails with Dev Days. Every project should have needs in a visible place (with their roadmap). Have a spot on your web site. OCIO doesn’t do this explicitly (yet?). | John: we do have https://www.aswf.io/projects and if you click on the logo you get all the details on the project and links to the resources. And we have this on the TAC site: https://tac.aswf.io/engagement | Carol: the “best” way to get involved with a project is to start using it / have a need to use it, and then have a list of needs ready. All projects deal with the same issues Gary is talking about. Dev Days should help with this, but ASWF needs to talk about engagement. | Wave: you made an interesting point with regards to potentially onboard someone quickly, here’s how you can write a short plugin using the API. Don’t know that most of the projects have the ability to do that, maybe that will pull people into the project. Once you are interested in the use case, you can get interested in contributing to the actual API. | JF: are you seeing more input from host applications? Gary: seeing a bit more of this now that we are part of the ASWF, would like to see a lot more of it. Haven’t seen contribution from Flame, Natron, there could be a lot more. If anybody has ideas on how to make it clear that things can change. The color management stuff comes from those frustrations. Eric: a tutorial for writing a plugin and using with Resolve might be cool - Resolve is widely used and anyone can grab a copy for free. | David: thank you for suggesting the idea for NAB / IBC. We now have enough projects that have an interest in those markets, we will look at doing the right size of activity at those events now that we have started expanding our reach with the Beer of a Feathers event in London. | . | . | . | . | . | Dev Days update - Carol Payne . | Originated with the idea of a ASWF Hackathon, but moved to name of “Dev Days”. TAC and board met at last year’s SIGGRAPH, ASWF + company sponsored hackathon. Lots of junior / intermediate engineers at our companies who are interested in participating in open source software, but haven’t had the opportunity to get involved. This level may be a good way to increase our contributor base. The people coming out of SLP don’t necessarily have the background to contribute to our projects. | At first targets our member companies, if someone is already working at our member companies, they typically already know what a pipeline is, how projects are used within a pipeline… | Want to send to companies to gauge the level of interest, want to send next week, so you have until next week to provide feedback, either on the document, or directly. | You might get that email as the representative for your company, so you will need to forward this within your company to determine level of interest. | In the document there are 3 different roles: . | Project maintainer | Company Lead | Dev Day Participant | . | Want each project that participates to commit to this. Would like people interested in participating to raise their hands, either now or later in Slack. We would like to schedule a separate meeting, what does it look like from your project’s perspective. Nothing is set in stone, participation may look different for different projects. If you as a project maintainer are interested, please reach out to me. | Any company that decides they want to participate, expect a Company Lead: could be TAC members, but could be someone else. Will take some organization, tracking people down, dealing with legal. So TAC representatives should be involved, but you don’t have to the Company Lead for your company. | We need to take action quickly, and commit as to whether we do this in October. Lots has to happen to make this a successful project, in particular not every project has a CLA in place yet. If we commit to this, we will announce this “fully” at Open Source Days at SIGGRAPH. | Rachel: to really make this happen will require a lot of support throughout the TAC and projects. | Larry: I bet that in everyone of our organizations, there have to be 3 or 4 junior engineers how are intrigued, but may not even know the projects they have the opportunity to participate. We should try to identify these people, try to pull them in, it’s our responsibility to provide growth opportunities, involvement with these projects gets your fingers into projects that are used throughout the industry, interact with senior people at your company and others, and benefit from networking / career development. We should be looking at this to help the career development of our more junior engineers. | Carol: I want to co-chair this effort, that helps events be more successful, so if someone is interested in co-chairing with me, please let me know. If I don’t hear from anybody within next week or so, that might limit the the desire to move forward with this project. | . | Security Working Group (Jim Helman) . | In January brought proposal for Security WG. As you move to the cloud, can’t rely on perimeter security. More software needs to become security aware, interact with authentication and authorization. Different from managing packaging, scanning for vulnerabilities. | Some discussions on Slack in February, led to a broad charter, there was some overlap with Security work in CI WG, put forward a much narrower charter on Slack . | Raising awareness of new runtime security models | Implications for ASWF projects | Consolidate and share best practices for implementing those | Someone has been doing a lot of security integration, did a project that uses OTIO, OpenAssetIO and OpenRV in a demonstration. We found that some of the applications that needed to be security aware were not. We provide a small patch / workaround. There should be framework code that could be reused, like “OpenFX for security”. Would be good if the WG could explore if there could be shared goal that could be reused. | Non goals: not trying to maintain code, or duplicate security aspects of CI WG | Deliverables would be documents | . | Reaching out to cloud providers to provide a good security technical resource. | Proposals for other projects, such as framework code, that the group may determine are needed. | If we can get critical mass, we could have a proposal back to the TAC to see if it’s something the ASWF wants to do. | Kimball: is there a deliverable in there to help projects how to test their project against a security baseline? Jim: having code reviewed and assessed by security experts is important. Advice on best practices for security assessments will be added. | Larry: don’t overestimate our current knowledge base. I guess that if you want to leaders of our current projects, they wouldn’t know if their project should consider authorization / authentication angle to things. They may not even know if it’s something they should build into their project. Don’t be afraid to treat us as if we know nothing of the topic! It’s far out of our expertise domain. Even very experienced developers have worked “inside the firewall”, authentication is all new, so starting at the beginning makes sense. Jim: emphasize educational aspect, maybe training videos. | JC: thanks for keeping this alive, I appreciate you coming up with this idea. I might want to expand the scope of point 1: it’s not just good for users, but also for the project. Authentication is used in OpenCue, and probably soon in Rez, would be good to gather existing authentication needs for projects. Jim: once we have a group of people who are interested, will update the proposed charter, discuss on Slack, maybe then we can have a call to flesh out remaining details. | Maybe also reach out to DCC vendors, we have this “Common Security Architecture for Production” based on Zero Trust model, the DCC vendors are very much engaged on that, so may be able to get engagement from vendor security teams. | Cary: We could designate a specific project to get a full audit, which would be less abstract. Guide a project through to the state it needs to be, that would inform the rest of us as to what we need to do. | Jim: we’ve already created a patch to OpenRV to get some of the security we needed for our demonstration, could see packages that need to support plugins, could be a good starting point. | . | .

    "content": ". | Updates . | Kimball: Make sure to fill the Dev Days survey, Carol is taking the lead, Larry is co-chairing | John: if you haven’t done it already, there’s a project maintainer survey that went out a couple of weeks ago and closes at the end of the month. Please fill it out! https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7yGTsFQ1Cd_pBho9i1ARIkm52urR3OiLE1EkRbJcR7Z7qaA/viewform | Kimball: I have a new job, have left Weta but still working for Weta, back at the studio as CTO. Someone else from Unity will show up as the TAC rep soon. | . | Close out changes on “what makes a good project” and lifecycle explanations - John Mertic - https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/417 . | To set context: TAC had a good discussion several weeks ago on topic of “what makes a good project”. Takes a lot of different forms, one thread was to try to quantity it, added language to that effect. But a second thread on having the TAC have more clarity about the incoming project, the annual review, how to say no. Typically when foundations get going, they use a “case law” process, but as you mature, encounter new situations, TACs start trying to codify the process. | A number of people have provided feedback, don’t want to look at the details of the PR / diff, but more what’s the end product: . | https://deploy-preview-417–aswf-tac.netlify.app/process/start_project.html | https://deploy-preview-417–aswf-tac.netlify.app/process/lifecycle.html | . | Work on “What makes a good project to host at ASWF” . | 8 bullet points: | Does the project address address a common problem in the motion picture and VFX industries that is not solved by other projects | Will the project gain alignment and participation amongst multiple constituents | Is the project leadership best positioned and capable of growing the project | What resources would the project need to be successful? | Will this project divert away resources from existing projects? | What existing code is coming into the project | Does the project have the feature set, robustness and scalability necessary to solve the problem for film production, or is there a clear roadmap and team? | If a project does not meet the above criteria, the TAC can reject the proposal | Does this seem to capture what TAC members were thinking? | JF: good to have a checklist to structure discussion after a proposal | John: anything missing? Don’t want to get too deep in the weeds. | Larry: this isn’t really the “first try”, there’s been a lot of input! | Gordon: the bottom bullet point (feature set / team / roadmap), doesn’t that be implied by the first (does the project address a common problem) | Larry: I don’t think, it may be a two stage thing. The first bullet point says “this is a problem domain that’s interesting / there’s a gap” vs “this project / team is likely to solve it”. Gordon: lots of projects come in and say in theory we could be a solution to the problem. But there’s something around the doctrine, we are here to serve a set of studios and ecosystem funding it, so we need to deliver value back to the people funding ASWF. It’s tricky to have an adoption criteria for anything coming in since hard to get new things getting off the ground? John: we might want to change “alignment” to “adoption”? | Gordon: usage / adoption would trump validity. John: if people are using something in multiple studios… Larry: I agree that the word usage should be somewhere. We are trying to write the criteria that doesn’t reject a project like ORI that “doesn’t exist”, but still feels like a safe bet, since backed by several member studios who had built something like that project before, thus minimizing the risk. So it doesn’t have to be adopted yet if we feel it’s a safe bet. Gordon: would love something around that: “does the project have broad adoption today, or the TAC believes it could have broad adoption in the future”. We want to stay away from building multiple different solutions addressing the same problem. Eric: project presenters will feel that the project will be the right solution, in many cases it will be less clear. Cary: we’re not staying these are all hard requirements, more they are points to consider. Eric: but you want to see people who get “rejected” understand why. Gordon: what would be an example of a project we would want to invest in that’s not yet in broad adoption. Suggesting “Does the project have broad adoption across film production studios, software vendors and related organizations, or is there a clear path to that adoption?” | John: “If a project does not meet all the above criteria, the TAC can reject the proposal”. Larry: could eliminate the last line after the bullet points, since there’s already a line before. | Cary: there’s a vote process anyway. Is this list intended to apply both to projects and WGs? John: didn’t think about it in the WG perspective, but WGs tend to be more time / deliverable bound. Kimball: we have the WGs called out earlier. | JF: list of criteria for WGs should be more lenient. John: we have a separate entry for WGs. WG bring a group of people together on a topic, can be exploratory, and is time bound. | Gordon: some of these points may not apply to WGs, but they aren’t “bad”. Would be a good question to ask a WG of what IP they bring? | John: for instance would the D&amp;I WG be able to answer these bullet points? | Eric: more “expertise” than “IP” for working groups so people don’t think they need to bring in their company lawyers | John: we may want to make it a separate exercise for WGs. But for the projects, any other changes we want before adding to PR? Eric: maybe the 9th point is redundant? | Gordon: have no reservations about overlap, I would suggest making it the second bullet, even if there’s potential for overlap. | Saved to PR, if we don’t hit more by next TAC meeting, we’ll commit it to the repo. | . | Project Lifecycle . | Wanted more clarity of what is expected of a sandbox project transitioning to incubation stage. There is language about a quarterly report as to project progress to TAC. Sometimes having a “tighter leash” can be helpful, but also don’t want to “paperwork people to death”. What would a quarterly report look like? | Eric: hesitation is that the regular projects are reporting once a year, so would take more TAC bandwidth. | John: doesn’t have to be an agenda item, could just be a PR / email. | Gordon: we could define reporting schedule at project adoption. Some projects may require different schedules. | John: could we do equivalent of an annual review closer than 6 months? Gordon: I wouldn’t say it has to have same coverage of an annual report, would be on a more ad hoc basis. Something is a “sandbox stage” for specific reasons, there is purpose on wanting an update. This seem tied to the fact that a sandbox stage project is there to answer questions. Want to know how far we are in answering the required questions before project can be graduated to incubation. | 3 criteria coming out of annual review: . | Move the project to Incubation Stage | Renew Sandbox Stage for a year if it feels it can get to incubation stage by the next Annual Review | Move to Archive Stage | . | It’s expected that Sandbox stage is for a year | Larry: we shouldn’t be too strict about that, sounds like a short timeline. If you are in experimental phase, going to a real incubation phase, that can easily be more than a year. Gordon: maybe a statement “projects should demonstrate progress towards the next stage”. Eric: this may be quite different for different projects. When we bring something into Sandbox stage, we could also state how long we expect the project to be in Sandbox Stage. Gordon: we need to document why we adopted a project in Sandbox Stage, for how long, and what’s the requested reporting schedule. John: “expected to move or have demonstrable progress on moving to the Incubation Stage”. | John: in other foundations, Incubation Stage projects have things worked out well, but they may not yet be broadly used. But it can be different in different foundations. | . | There is language about quarterly reports for Incubation Stage projects, we can discuss if that makes sense. Kimball: seems excessive. And we don’t have to wait for a year to have a Incubation Stage project move to Adopted Stage. | Gordon: since we’ve defined a similar structure between Sandbox and Incubation, is this duplication? Larry: some of the things in Incubation are foundational / widely used, completely different from Sandbox project. Gordon: so that’s the difference in the framework? | Eric: there’s a comment about Sandbox projects don’t have a press release, there’s a notion about “endorsement” | John: for sandbox, “it’s a good idea that people agree on, but not all the code / alignment / consensus”, it could change while in the sandbox. The other aspect is that we end up spending a lot of time getting the project structure / governance in place, but you don’t have to worry about a lot of these while in sandbox. Projects in Incubation are “ready to start accelerating”, ready to start getting a lot of users / growth. Larry: MaterialX / OSL / OTIO are still in Incubation stage, yet they are widely used, slowly working through some of the things on checklist, but the solidity of these projects is much higher than what we expect something in sandbox to be. | Matthew (Chat): If the expectation is that Sandbox projects move to Incubation stage within a year, getting updates more frequently than once a year seems important to track convergence. But maybe that timeline for Incubation can be loosened. | . | Adopted Stage . | After annual review, the TAC should officially state that “it’s good for another year”? Less of an issue for current projects, but could be useful in the future if you have a project that’s been stuck in Adopted stage. Larry: is that better adopted by having to vote on every project annually, or an “exceptional” process? | John: I’ve seen it done both ways. It’s up to the TAC to decide if it wants to have to say an explicit “Yes”? Gordon: I like the idea of having to explicitly vote, will make it OK to say no once in a while. Otherwise a project could end up “grandfathered”, most of the time will just be yes. | Gordon: maybe that vote should be at the next meeting? John: this TAC doesn’t always feel that they should vote right away, so that could be done that way. Could be just a practice the vote has. Kimball: it’s good to say we don’t have concerns. Eric: let’s do it and see how we like it. John: don’t need to document it explicitly for now. There are options in the current language. | Cary: we haven’t had the experience of a project entering a crisis, but it’s not far fetched for a “vital” project not to meet its goals. But the solution is not necessarily to “vote them out”. John: this is what I tend to see, you don’t want to cast a project out when it can be helped. Maybe there’s just things that need to be fixed. Cary: looking at the expectations statement, there’s some middle ground for an “intervention”. | . | We will get this merged by the time of the next meeting. | . | COMOMO Project Analysis . | Financial impact and value of a project, took MaterialX as a value | How many dollars of engineering effort are you leveraging, it’s not just free, you are leveraging a lot of effort that led to the project. | . | .

Want to make USD as a format and as a technology more accessible, make tools accessible, store accessibility data. We want to help with what we carry in USD files. Had chat with other people in ASWF, they were excited about this. So instead of just launching a small sub USD group, decided to create ASWF-wide channel for #accessibility to raise awareness and help all projects be more accessible. There are small things we can do to make tools and software more accessible, but there could be efforts across our projects, use the same metadata to store accessibility information. We want to push for this, not sure where it’s heading, if it will be an actual WG like D&amp;I, still figuring it out, but first step is to raise awareness for the topic, gather the people interested, and take it from there.

Wanted to thank everyone for creating a space where a project can start in the open, have open conversations on Slack, first Sandbox project, and I advocate this. | An interoperability standard for the tools and content management systems used in media production. | TSC Chairperson: Town Cowland tom@foundry.com | TSC Members and Affiliations . | … | . | Incubation Project review criteria . | To be accepted at the Incubation stage, a project must meet the sandbox requirements plus: | … | Have gotten through a lot of the code quality requirements. | Community and contributor growth assessment . | Todo: outline of the plan for the project to complete the requirements for Adopted Stage | . | Obtain an affirmative vote of the TAC . | Proposing that we stay in the sandbox stage for a little while, we’re still in alpha, will be hitting beta around SIGGRAPH | Don’t have diversity of contributors yet | . | Contributions . | 821 Commits | 160 issues resolved | 3 core contributors (Foundry) | 6 additional casual contributions from 3 orgs . | Mostly documentation tweaks | We value all contributions | Hoping to put specific production examples and use cases | . | . | . | Organizations contributing and/or using in production . | Foundry | MovieLabs | Ynput (OpenPipe) | OpenTimelineIO | Open Review Initiative | . | Key achievements in the past year . | Added a new full time contributor | Migration to batch-first, traits based API . | Only possible thanks to community input | . | Integrations (PoC / alpha) . | OTIO Media Linker | OpenRV | USD Ar2 plugin | Foundry Nuke / Katana AssetAPI plugin | MovieLabs Sandbox Resolver | Ayon | MaxR EU XR Research Project | Each project highlighted things we hadn’t thought about before | Mix of open source and proprietary | We are very early in the adoption curve, people need “vision” to see where we are going with this | . | . | Areas the project could use help on . | Anyone with spare time and C++/Python (g)RPC knowledge | Defining common types of asset (high level) | Build, CI, release tasks/tooling, documentation, examples | UI for Asset Management / Production Tracking . | Technologies / strategies / integration challenges | . | Modern web engines vs DCC tools . | Portability | Trying to get a modern web browser in an app is not easy | Fast update cycles, security concerns | 2-3 delay before new versions get picked up in production | . | Avoid “the menu in the corner” artists need to use for common tasks | . | TAC Open Discussion . | Thank you for the support on the project! | Kimball: anyone has questions? | JF: do we need a vote to renew sandbox status? Apparently we do. | JF: what do you see as your MVP? Tom: first beta around SIGGRAPH, happy that the core API is fit for purpose based on integrations done this year. So users don’t have to worry about multiple changes after that. So if they write a plugin for the pipeline or vendors for their DCC, it won’t change too much. Language bindings for C++ and Python, so people can start picking it up. What will be called a v1 will depend on that phase. So next 3-6 months is good opportunity to start using it in earnest. | Kimball: do you see a UI for browsing assets in scope or not? Or tools to configure infrastructure (gRPC servers). Tom: vision is to have a common API of how to put plugins inside a tool. “Don’t use File/Save”! When you use software in production, you have to unlearn a lot. File/Open or File/Save should be possible to bring up a custom browser, we don’t want to provide a common UI, more about how we delegate a UI. | Eric: could there be some kind of abstraction layer like FUSE for filesystems? Tom: we think of it as orthogonal concerns, this specific project has a non UI layer that takes an identifier and turns it into usable data, like Ar2 in USD. Also some query layers. Specific case of File access, take UNC reference into URL, that’s the handoff to other systems. Trying to borrow what’s in OIIO for URL schemes. But don’t need to adopt the whole vertical stack. There are lots of parts of the solution, but don’t necessarily need to take all of these on in an opinionated fashion. Eric: seems like a smart way to break up the problem. | Kimball: motion to continue OpenAssetIO as a sandbox project? Larry: I’ll make the motion. J Goldstone: I second. JF: unfortunately we don’t have quorum for voting members. Kimball: we will vote over email. | . | . | OpenQMC Project (framestore) . | Josh Bainbridge: head of rendering technology team, conceived the project | Nathan | Lor | Why are we here? . | Introducing the OpenQMC project from Framestore | Putting this forward as a candidate for ASWF adoption at sandbox phase | Providing the information needed for ASWF to make a call | . | Background . | Original idea for open source from 2018 ACM TOG on rendering . | A question to the panel: when talking about open source and production rendering, what is missing? That’s a hard question, there’s already OIIO for textures, OSL for shading, OpenVDB for volumes, Embree, Optix… but a sampling library is missing, and OpenQMC is that. | . | OpenQMC is park of Freak, Framestore’s production renderer . | Using Freak in production for over 6 years | . | Considerable amount of experience in this area . | Had been developing before Freak | OpenQMC is latest iteration of this | . | Could benefit projects similar to: . | Blender Cycles | MoonRay | Good time to bring it to community | . | . | Problem Case . | Reducing noise in production rendering is expensive | OpenQMC is one way of making this more efficient | Applies methods from Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) . | Being very careful about which points you use, not purely random, so more efficient | . | Critical component to physically based renderers . | Nothing novel / new, everyone is doing this, but that’s the point. Want to collaborate on this and centralize work / effort. | . | . | Results . | Less noise with a single sample per pixel when working interactively | Converge quicker | . | Overview . | OpenQMC includes: . | Library for sampling low discrepancy points . | C++ with no dependencies | Built for CPU + GPU | . | API for integration into production graphics engines . | There’s already a lot of academic papers with sample code, some are used in commercial products, but there isn’t a framework where you can plug sampling technologies that can integrate into higher level sampling system, in a way you can use everywhere, and be confident the results will be correct. | . | Tools and testing for development and analysis | . | There are 3 primary aims: . | Standardize a flexible sampler API | Deliver performant implementation | Provide high quality results . | Implement latest papers | . | . | Non goals . | Implement an exhaustive list of techniques . | Allow users to pick the right solution for their problems | . | Provide educational implementations . | Prioritize performance and quality | . | . | . | Summary . | C++ library for graphics engines | Reduces noise and optimizes performance | A universal problem. No current standard solution | . | ASWF Sandbox Motivation . | Framestore recently became an ASWF member | Common mission with ASWF: . | Collaborate to build quality tools | Have an open forum for contribution | Provide governance for a standard solution | . | Benefit for the community . | Provide a tested and high quality solution for point sampling | Document workflows for common use cases and integration | . | Project benefits from ASWF sandboxing . | Provide exposure to a larger community to grow | Help steer the project to meet the community needs | Use the sandbox stage to allow for API breaking changes. What we have now works well for Framestore but may not work for others, so this is the time to find something that works for everybody. | . | . | Project alignment . | Built from the beginning for open source | Based on the ASWF sample project | Issue tracking, meeting notes etc | Uses VFX Reference Platform . | No library dependencies, but use the compiler | . | Contribution process . | Apache License 2.0 | DCO sign-off required | Digitallt signed commits | PRs and CI testing | . | . | Summary . | Framestore are committed to contributing further improvements from production to this open initiative. We think the project’s mission to standardize such technology across our industry, together to collaborate and achieve ever greater tools for content creation, aligns with the goals of ASWF. We also believe that adoption of OpenQMC as an ASWF sandbox project to help us achieve this by bringing together in a single forum, and giving access and exposure to a larger community. Private repo, can ask for access: https://github.com/framestore/openqmc | . | Questions? . | Ken: can you elaborate on API design philosophy? Josh: in previous iterations, we found it’s hard to determine where the points are distributed. You have specific systems for lights, volumes… You want points laid out in a way that doesn’t introduce bias. Hard to “keep in your head” when you have a large code base. We have a system based on domains for each problem, use hashing, only pay the compute cost when you ask for the samples. But statistically independent from other parts of the code base. | Ken: how do you support GPU with C++? Josh: we also use CUDA. This can all change, the ideas and design behind it are sound, but can iterate based on what other studios are using. Ken: we should talk, being able to embrace other graphics api through C99 is something we looked at in NanoVBD. Josh: we are interested in hearing about that. | Laura: would also be interested in having render kernel library team take a look at it, we could contribute for Intel support. | Larry: very interesting proposal. Can you share any documentation / what the API looks like so people can get an idea of how it’s used? Josh: yes, can create a PDF. Larry: that would be awesome to have our teams look at it. Josh: project comes with an example path tracer to show how it can be integrated. | Matthew: would look to forward to render team. Moonray could be potential opportunity, we don’t currently use QMC in our source, we did but had some issues, might have been an implementation detail. When we were using it, we found that a lot of techniques were patented by Mental Images, that got flagged (even though we were licensees). Not sure if this could be an issue? Are the techniques you are using fall under the patents? Josh: we have looked into it, some patents have expired, some have not. Would appreciate NVIDIA’s involvement to have a look at it. Our primary sampler we think is “safe”, but any input from other parties would be useful. Ken: happy to bring up internally at NVIDIA. | Wave: great presentation. Would love to get something I can pass on to GPU team at Apple, see how it could map to Metal. Also speaking as Blender foundation member, have you investigated that yet? Don’t know if it would be a straight forward fit. Josh: this is why we want to bring it as sandbox project so we can talk to them. | Chris: curious about analysis part of the project, what are you analyzing and how extensive is it? Josh: we have a standard battery of tests, make sure we aren’t introducing bias. Wrapped up in unit testing. Have a Python API that allows you to visualize a lot of the results. Also provide benchmarking, and want to grow and improve upon. Gives us a lot of confidence in the results. There’s also optimizers which we run offline, work on spatiotemporal blue noise. Outputs data that can be incorporated into the code. | Larry: who should we contact to access to GitHub repo? Lor: I can be point on that: lorna.dumba@framestore.com | Kimball: we don’t have quorum so we won’t be doing a vote today but will definitely follow up. That brings us to top of the hour, thank you and see you next time! | . | . | . ",

Larry: yes, those were the concerns that made everyone say we need to resolve this before we decide to vote on the other merits. JF: should LF legal be engaged on this? Yarille: we could run it by them. Larry: we are waiting for a member company who may hold some of this IP to provide some guidance. | Erik: Does OpenQMC people know there is an action item? Eric: have action item to meet with John Mertic and speak internally at NVIDIA, should be able to sort it out but may take a couple of weeks. | Yarille: we can push to next meeting for this. | . | Virtual Town Hall recordings (Emily) . | I am working on getting all the virtual town hall recordings posted, and they should be up by Friday | . | Erik: meeting schedule vs AMPAS Sci-Tech Awards . | Larry: it is Sci-Tech investigation season and several TAC members may have conflicting schedule requirements. | . | Dev Days Plug . | Larry: coming up in October, want to make sure people know about it, make sure if people in your organization wish to participate… Having Good First Issues markers in GitHub helps. Does everyone know what we are talking about. | Matthew: looking forward to it! | JF: do you already have commitments? Larry: that’s a good question! Several companies have expressed interest, but not necessarily hard commitments. Even if only a few companies participate, that will be a good learning experience. But sometimes getting all the ducks in a row can take time, so don’t wait until the last minute to get a CLA in place for instance. | Carol: have time set aside on Friday to work on this, start conversations, how are we going to get people signed up, leverage LF infrastructure. Figure out logistical aspects. If anyone is interested in helping to wrangle, feel free to reach out. If you have filled out company interest questionnaire, thank you for that, you will hear back shortly. Start planning on what people would be working on. Working with LF to put together a one page web site so people can see who is participating, and show what projects can pick to work on (not every project will participate). If you are a project leader and haven’t expressed interest yet, reach out to me or Larry. | Larry: of course a project wouldn’t reject a PR coming out of this effort, but may not have people “on call” to help. Carol: want to have projects committed to the event to give a good first experience, and it may not be in scope for this event. Larry: in no way limited to member companies of ASWF, anybody can participate, students, non member companies… Carol: we have heard from member companies that there may be many developers who could be interested so that’s the target focus, but registration will be open. | Gordon: sent you confirmation of Autodesk’s participation, Doug Walker is our point person. Carol: sounds great! | Eric: no consolidated list of starter tasks? Carol: will leave this to the individual projects to do, since they are so different. Want folks to chose the project they are interested in, and each project will approach their Good First Issues differently. But they should have a plan for what they want participants to contribute. | Matthew: Dreamworks is having an internal Hackaton that week, so will work well with this. | . | Open Review Initiative Annual Review . | Erik Strauss, TSC Chair for Open Review Initiative | This will be a bit different than other reviews, we are an umbrella projects with 3 projects: 2 projects, and a set of reference implementations and test suites. Will talk on progress on all 3 projects and general direction, but not deep dive into each project. | We are a sandbox initiative, so this is supposed to determine whether we are ready to move to incubation stage | Bried description: An umbrella project containing multiple review oriented project repositories. As of 8/23 two content review applications, an encoding test suite, and a shared infrastructure repo for future collaboration. | Contributions from DNEG, Autodesk, Disney Imagineering, Sony Imageworks | Incubation criteria . | Have completed and approved the Technical charter and agree to transfer relevant trademarks | … | Have achieved and maintained a CII Best Practices Badge at passing level | Have had a successful license scan with any critical issues resolved | … | . | 3 separate projects . | OpenRV . | Good progress | . | X-Studio . | Less progress (priorities) | . | Encoding Guidelines | . | Contributions . | Encoding guidelines . | Mostly Sam Richards driving this work, but consistent contributions. Relatively small project, about the guidelines and enhancing the test suite, make sure color can be reproduced accurately. Sam is extending this into HDR and other codecs. | . | OpenRV . | A much larger footprint of resources, and has all the infrastructure that Autodesk brings to the table. You can see that to the consistency of the contributions from original release to current time. | . | X-Studio . | A bit spottier: original release, then intermittent contributions. They are an in-house developed tool, the dev team is focussed on internal application development and less outwardly focussed for now | . | . | Key Achievements in the past year . | 3 initial projects released in Jan 2023 . | Open RV | X-Studio | ORI Encoding Guidelines and test suite | . | X-Studio Windows port released Aug 2023 | Shared open development happening on UI skinning, common plug-in API, synch schema for interop between systems | Finding our mojo. Leading up to SIGGRAPH the collective group has started to find its path forward as a collection of components that enable interop between arbitrary playback systems with OpenRV and X-Studio providing the platform for this shared development concept. | . | Areas the project could use help on . | Each project is at a different level of maturity based on its maintainer’s experience with OOS and available resourcing. | Less experienced teams need guidance and support | . | The barrier to entry for developer contributors is high . | We’d like to lower the barrier by building a community based plugin ecosystem, but need advice on management, curation, and contribution strategies so it doesn’t turn into a sea of 1000 RV playlist manager Python plugins from every TD who has ever worked in M&amp;E | . | Many open questions from both the community and internally require legal consultation . | Binary distribution with non-compatible licenses | Input Codec licenses: (VP1/AV1/ProRes) | Output Licenses: DolbyVision/Atmos/Opus | . | . | Assessment . | ORI is still in a SANDBOX project . | The project mission has recently gelled, and there is excitement behind it, but no real validation of success via shared code | User engagement is high (packed houses at all three BOF sessions) but developer engagement is low | The projects are complex and easy entry points for contribution are required | … | . | . | Wave: a fair assessment of where you are at, it’s a complicated space. Erik: most focussed on engagement piece, want to get it into people’s hands, gap between what we can offer today, and the goal of accessibility. Had offline conversations with John during SIGGRAPH, is there a way we could distribute binaries with a compatible license with FFMPEG. Have some homework to do on our side to come up with something we think is the “least offensive” collection of FFMPEG compilation flags. Will follow up with John. Also onramping folks into these complicated code bases is not easy. Initially a lot of excitement from the studios of moving towards X-Studio, but since there are only a few developers, there are core features missing in X-Studio which are barriers to assumption. So need some basic functionality around timeline, tracks… For now development is driven by internal DNEG needs. So RV remains popular, but it is a complicated beast for even a senior developer to jump in. How do we get to a plugin ecosystem where people can contribute, learn about APIs by interfacing with them, even if they can’t immediately contribute to the core. | JF: how did the Windows port for X Studio happened? Erik: that was driven by Epic, Michael had been working on this for a while, so happened outside of TSC, a contribution from Epic since they care about the Windows environment and care about X-Studio as a product. But it seems like a win, spontaneous contributions from companies is a positive. But suffers from the fact that it’s still source code and requires compilation. Potentially can grow the addressable market of users and contributors, but not a complete solution. | Yarille: do we have quorum? JF: we have 13 of 25, so we do. So we are good to go to proceed (50% quorum). | Erik: motion is to extend the status of Sandbox until the next review. Wave: I will make the motion to extend for year. Larry is seconding. All yeahs, no abstains, no nays, motion carries. Congratulation on another year! | Eric: this is not an easy project to manage? Erik: yes, getting good at herding cats. | . | New membership at Intel . | Sean: will become board member and Laura will be alternate | Erik Niemeyer is a senior optimization engineer at Intel and will represent on the TAC. | Have been at Intel 23 years, worked in industy for 12 years, worked in creator industry, optimization on the x86 platform. Excited to contribute to develop new projects and help optimize existing ones. Spearheading effort at Intel to help optimize dependencies in the content creation space. | Everyone: welcome! | . | Did we discuss doing a SIGGRAPH / Open Source Days retrospective as a TAC / Board activity (Carol)? . | Can talk to John / Emily | Yarille: had a meeting today, gathering information, will bring to them. | Wave: have been at two meetings at work doing a SIGGRAPH post mortem, if there’s a condensed version of what worked at Open Source Days, that would be very valuable. Yarille: yes, there will be a recap | Carol: ways for us as projects to pass on feedback to the “power that be” would be good, discussed this at recent OCIO TSC. Mostly positive! Larry: anything you want to repeat here? Carol: general sentiment is that we had pretty good attendance at virtual town hall and BoF, but didn’t have a good overlap between the two. Had anticipated that people would tune in to virtual Town Hall before SIGGRAPH, but we asked people at the BoF who had watched the Virtual Town Hall and it was only 2 people. We hadn’t planned to do project update at the Bof, so we pulled a couple of ad-hoc slides, but ended up doing a mini project update at the BoF, since most attendees had no idea what we had previously presented. Larry: maybe if Virtual Town Halls were earlier it would have helped? Carol: don’t want to sound too negative, but most people didn’t know the Virtual Town Halls had happened. People expect the presentations to be at SIGGRAPH. So maybe giving it another year, will be interesting to see how it works. | Wave: a lot of coworkers in LA went to Digipro, ASWF and SIGGRAPH, for the local people, it may have “snuck up” on them. There was a lot happening at the same time. Last year felt like a trial run, this year was full on SIGGRAPH craziness. Carol: overall it was good, having the recordings ahead of SIGGRAPH would have helped. Understood that this is not simple. | Yarille: if you want to gather your feedback, will let John know to put this on an upcoming agenda so that we can discuss this, we did talk about this earlier, but will be good to capture all the points brought up. Carol: also we’re thinking early as possible what things are going to look at with SIGGRAPH in Denver next year. | . | Robin: is anything going on with X3DE (?), is it under this group? . | Larry: no, it wasn’t under this group | . | Robin: do we have a date for Dev Days? . | Carol: yes, 2nd week of October, 2 day period | . | .

Trying to look 2 meeting ahead, using Kanban board to represent upcoming vs future meetings. | Gives visibility since board is publicly visible. | Can provide more context, for instance Chris Kulla had added link to slide deck for OSL review. | Made it easy to build notes, there’s an auto generated template, and a list of attendees. Easy to cut-n-paste the Markdown code into hackmd.io which is like a Google Docs for Markdown. Helps with the meeting minutes. | From experience with other projects, seems to go pretty well. Next meeting we’ll fully shift over. | Erik: seems like too much mechanism, a shared doc is adequate? Kimball: if it helps JF to automate the creation of things? JF: I don’t have a strong opinion, I’ll do whatever works. Kimball: I don’t have a bookmark set. John: we can tweak this over this, it’s not a fixed / complex thing, but seems to help with scalability over time on other projects. It seems like a good infrastructure to have in place, but we can revisit. Cary: OpenEXR moved minutes out of repo into Confluence a year ago, submitting minutes through PR, distributed with project, enjoyed not having the minutes stuff mixed with the repo. John: the TAC repo doesn’t really get distributed. Carol: we did the same thing, it was cluttering our GitHub Slack as well. | . | Annual Review - Open Shading Language (Chris Kulla) . | Presentation Slide Deck | Open Shading Language - What is it? . | Shading Language spec for modern production renderers | A compiler and efficient runtime for the language | leverages LLVM for CPU and GPU | Started 15 years ago | . | Adoption . | Software supporting OSL: . | 3DS, Arnold, Blender/Cycle/… | . | Ties to other ASWF projects: . | Dependencies: OIIO, OCIO, OpenEXR, OpenVDB | Used by: MaterialX | Collaborate with: OIIO, MaterialX, OCIO | . | At least 190 films (that we know of … please tell us!) | . | Agenda . | Present OSL TSC | Updates on recent release | Roadmap | State of the project | . | OSL TSC . | Meets every other week . | Chair: Chris Kulla | Architect: Larry Gritz | . | 11 Voting Members | Usually 5-10 more non-voting attendees | . | Key Developments since ASWF membership . | Batch shading mode using SIMD ops on Intel AVX / AVX-512 . | Contributed by Intel and Pixar | . | GPU back-end for NVIDIA OptiX/Cuda . | NVIDIA | Sony Imageworks | Used by several shipping renderers | . | Overhaul of material closures . | Collaboration with MaterialX | Epic &amp; Autodesk | . | . | Recent Releases in the last year . | Shipping 8 patch releases of 1.12 (monthly) . | Bug fixes | Build improvements . | Support for LLVM 15 | OptiX library no longer a dependency of OSL runtime | . | Improvements to testrender for MaterialX testsuite | . | Release 1.13 (expected September 2023) . | New Alternative APIs for renderer callbacks . | LLVM bitcode based, allows renderer code to be inlined into JITed shaders | . | New APIs for streamlined data access | … | . | . | Roadmap . | Intel actively designing / contributing on SPIR-V backend | Support for LLVM 16+ (Help wanted!) | Expand usage of new LLVM bitcode API . | Shout-outs: Intel, Animal Logic, Pixar | . | Improve support for MaterialX closures in testrender | Support for triangle geometry in testrender | Evolutions to language syntax . | New datatypes matching MaterialX | Ability to re-evaluate connected nodes in material graph | Other shader-writer improvements we’ve been putting off | . | . | Help Wanted . | Good news: active development by Sony, Intel, Animal Logic, Autodesk, Pixar | Areas where we could use help: . | Windows CI and improve Windows build experience | GPU CI | LLVM 16+ overhaul | More people working on GPU and related overhauls | Documentation, especially renderer integration | Ordinary small daily tasks . | Core developers are spread thin on major features, but still get sucked into basic tasks | . | . | . | State of the Project . | Incubation since 2020 | OpenSSF best practices . | Passing 100% | Silver 87% | Gold 70% (some may not apply) | . | Top contributors by surviving lines of code (git-fame) . | Sony Imageworks (69%) | Intel (23%) | NVIDIA (2%) | Community (6%) | . | Ready for graduation? | . | Questions? . | Carol: don’t have any question, but get presentation, and seems like you are ready for graduation. | Larry: not sure the Intel contribution is overstated, recently we’ve been increasing variety of sources. Also NVIDIA contribution may be understated. Thrilled that Animal Logic is contributing some deep patches and got merged. | Larry: something I like about the TSC meetings is that on top of discussing the code and project, it has become a forum for renderer designers to discuss and share issues they are running into, techniques that people find interesting. People have previewed talks that eventually became conference talks. So it’s become a forum that didn’t exist before to talk about the shading problem in general. A place for learning and knowledge sharing, I find that one of the more valuable parts of the meeting. | Chris: some of the companies that initially adopted OSL did this by forking and then improving their own fork, in the past year of so, both Animal Logic and Pixar are working to contributing everything back and getting back onto the main version. Good discussions about the changes they made, where it helps, where it doesn’t. | Chris: 6% of miscellaneous community contributions, for instance good PRs from Blender, OSL is shipped with Blender and hits corner cases we wouldn’t hit otherwise. | Larry: it’s become the main shading language exposed to 3DS Max users, a huge user base, and uses different parts of the language. | JF: are you asking for a vote on project graduation? Larry: yes, and would save us having to do a replay. It’s a bit of an odd situation that the graduation process is somewhat orthogonal to how widely used a project is. This is a foundational project used across studios and companies, the problem is very mature at this point. So we feel that graduation is fitting. | . | Voting: we have 13 voting members, 12 absent. Erik presents motion to approve, Carol seconds. All yes, no opposes, no abstains. Motion passes, congratulation OSL for graduation! | . | OpenQMC Project Proposal . | Erik: no progress on this, move to next meeting | | . | Dev Days (Carol Payne) . | Used Google Sites to create a site | Want to launch registration tomorrow, we weren’t able to get in touch with LF team to build a website, so built our own. Not as pretty, but will work. | Basic info: what you need to do prior to the event, how the event will look. | Have official responses from these projects: . | MaterialX | OCIO | OpenImageIO | OpenEXR | . | So if your project wants to participate, let me know ASAP so it can be on the list | Need some FAQs | Carol: Google Sites has quite improved since last time I used it, also works on Mobile. Will want a link from the ASWF site to this site, but want to get it done since we need to move. | Date: Oct 12-13 (Thu/Fri). For folks on the other side of the world, we want a 1 day commitment, but hopefully this is timezone friendly. | There’s a Register button which sends you to a Google form, form is short, wanted to get feedback if anything is missing. We don’t require that people work for a company to participate. There’s no way to restrict how many items are picked in a list, but we’re asking to limit to 2 projects. Larry: I’m more concerned that they may not know yet what project they want to pick? Cary: maybe “any of the above” could be an option? Carol: projects need some idea of how many people will participate. Maybe add a “I don’t know yet” option? Larry: if someone is committed to participating, hopefully they will get in touch with the project via Slack? Maybe we should indicate that. I like the form and the web site. | Carol: waiting for response from LF about what we need from a legal perspective. Added CLA and age requirements. Need feedback before end of day. | Pointed out CLA several times so people aren’t surprised that they will need to sign that. | Didn’t have something from OCIO yet, but will ask every project participating to put up a “project ideas” document / list (example from OCIO that had been done for GSoC). Link to “Good First Issues” in GH issues. Ideas from the project itself of how people can contribute in a 1 day context. We will launch tomorrow whether we have these or not, will add links on the side after the fact under the Participating Projects header. | Larry: Carol has emphasized what we need from the projects, but don’t forget that for those people who represent companies, you will need to wrangle CLAs, recruit people in your company you think should participate… Those people are likely not on the communication channels where this will be announced. We need to find the people in our departments who will be good for this. | Carol: spreadsheet to keep track of who wants to represent their company . | Get OK from company on participation | Getting CLA in place | Getting people to participate in time | Direct them to where they need to go for help on building project… | Also a tab for the projects, we would love for more projects to participate. It’s not a huge commitment, it’s only 2 days. Just being available, committing your project / TSC, and making them available to help new devs. | . | If the first instance is small and helps us to figure out how to do this, that’s OK. Not looking to make this huge, but want a good experience for people who participate. Even if we only have 10 people participating, we want to make sure the projects are available to help them. | Jonathan: we had never created a B&amp;W version of the MaterialX logo, but Apple has created one, will reach out and get that for you. | Jonathan: want to support this, it’s a hugely important initiative. Will the management support spending the time, but at our company, they do. | Larry: shouldn’t be onerous on the part of the companies or project, just means not to forget to check the comes. It’s not like you are going to sit in front of it for 8 hours. But allocate the day for the juniors who want to participate. | Cary: it’s a great initiative, our experience on how it unfolds will depend on on how many people and at what level. We may get a lot inquiries from people at a very junior level, even getting people to build the projects can be challenging. Unfortunately I’ll be out of town on those days, but will connect with as many people as possible, plan to get the project built by then. | MaterialX: we were inspired by the Dev Days event to add First Good Issues to the MaterialX project, and people have already started addressing them. | Larry: it’s very important from the project point of view to pull in new blood, but from a studio perspective, this addresses the issue of projects which are critical infrastructure, but you may only have a single engineer familiar with working inside the project. This can help de-risk use of the foundational projects. Also we all know how much we get out of participating in ASWF, it’s a huge professional development opportunity, but looking for ways for people earlier in their careers can benefit from this. So outside of the actual contributions to the projects, it’s valuable to have more contributors. | Carol: we want everyone participating to have a good experience, working with projects folks, getting support, the success metric isn’t PRs submitted to projects. Hopefully this will encourage people to stick around long term. | For projects, it will be helpful for your documentation if it’s not up to par. | JF: should we state up front that building on Linux (or macOS) might be easier than Windows? Could it be a FAQ? | Larry: we don’t want to scare away Windows users. Kimball: we may want to coordinate Windows activity betwene projects. | Erik: but want to set expectations, at least a heads up? | Carol: will make sure there are some basic expectations set: this isn’t a “teach C++” activity. | David: when do you plan to go live? Carol: have to push the button by tomorrow evening due to personal commitments. But press doesn’t have to go out until next week. Haven’t heard from LF yet. David: you’ve reached out to Emily? Carol: everyone at LF was on the email. David: will work at having link from the main page. Carol: will CC you. | Erik: can we get first issues for OSL? Chris: OSL is a pretty high bar for newcomers. Erik: thinking about NVIDIA employees who might be OK with CUDA. Larry: not sure we can break this up into short tasks. We may let OSL sit this one out, cut our teeth on some of the easier projects. | . | . ",

Will look into sizing chart. Some features we can enable / disable, and maybe we just haven’t enabled some features. But product descriptions we don’t have control over. I purchased a shirt for a project, ordered a Lady’s Small, it can to mid leg, we’ll see if something can be done about sizing. My order came really fast, surprising since it’s print on demand. | Michael (chat): Sample Size Chat | Joseph: the quality of the fabric and silk screening was great | Carol: thanks for limiting the colors, but if we have specific issues for a project, should we reach out to you, or just put it in the ticket? Yarille: can just do it over email. | Carol: thank you for the work on this! | . | Dev Days Update (Carol) . | Emails went out yesterday, sent out template, trying to make it as easy as possible. We want as many people from member companies to participate. Two templates for outreach: one for you as your company lead, sending out to your company. Second one is for someone you know who would like to participate, has all the links populated, hopefully will make it easier for people to have all the information they need. We’ve already got 17 registered participants, and that’s before a lot of outreach has been done. Should we expect more? | Participant Outreach Template | Project Guidelies | Dev Days Worksheet | Cary: I put out a solicitation at ILM and got 12 volunteers. Not the profiles I was expecting: 2 juniors, 10 fairly senior people. Larry: had similar results at my company. Need to “rattle the cage” of some more junior people. Cary: senior people, but without a history of contributing, so not just the usual suspects. Matthew Low: started outreach at Dreamworks. | Carol: Slack channel good place to coordinate. | Larry: very happy with the results so far | Carol: someone signed up from Scanline, they will need to sign CLA, so will need to make sure that happens. Will need to coordinate with people who don’t have a company lead. | Carol: email was to project leads that have volunteered to participate, but in the form where we ask for sign up, we allow participants to sign up for interest in 2 projects. Got a couple of responses for OpenCue, OTIO, so we could arrange for that to happen if someone wants to help supervise. | Carol: we’re going to be asking for volunteers, even if you aren’t actively contributing to a project and want to volunteer, please let me know. | Jonathan: in addition to ILM folks Cary mentioned, sent a notice to MaterialX Slack, have had a bunch of people writing back in DMs, is there a way to channel these answers to make it more visible? Carol: yes, they will need to register through the form website. Jonathan: some may or may not have, will make sure to remind them. Carol: MaterialX has more registrants than any other. So make sure to reach out to your community, it has worked for Jonathan. Jonathan: I may have gone too far and promised direct membership, but I will do so. | . | OpenQMC Proposal (Eric) . | Talked to John Mertic to get some clarity on some legal points with Linux Foundation | Fully expect it will work out fine, but have to get sign off internally | Kimball: we’re holding off on getting back to them until we have clarity?

Only thing you can’t do is make a movie out of it. | DPEL web site | We launched DPEL web site in August 2022, did a presentation at Open Source Days. | . | Initial Assets . | ASC StEM2 - Standard Evaluation Material 2 | Animal Logic ALab - USD Production Scene | AWS Noa Character . | From in-house team FuzzyPixel | A Maya model, fully rigged, with hair groom | . | Intel Volumetric Clouds Library . | OpenVDB, low / medium / high resolution | . | . | 2 new assets . | Animal Logic ALab - Trailer . | full media clips, audio, OTIO timeline | . | 4004 Moor Lane - USD Scene from Intel . | Constructed to be challenging for path tracers: narrow openings to let light in, architectural feature + foliage | 20 built in cameras to highlight challenging shot compositions | Around 7.5GB | . | . | Near Pipeline: Picchu Edit . | Contributed by AWS | DaVinci Resolve project, source media, and OTIO assets | . | Near Pipeline (infra) GitHub web site . | Implemented by Dreamworks | Convert DPEL website from LF Creative to GitHub . | uses Astro framework | . | Changes through PR review | GitHub Actions to preview, deploy | Self server | 98% done since beginning of summer, about to push it out | . | Far Pipeline . | 2023(?) AWS Airship - complex vehicle, with UDIMs (from short film Spanner) | Proposal: ALab trailer OTIO with links to ALab USD cameras . | ASWF mashup! Combining the worlds of 3D-CG and Editorial | Prototyped by Michael + Joshua | Michael: wired the 25 USD cameras into the scene, can jump between them. Complexity comes from trying to line up the OTIO, it’s a “conversation” since there’s no piece of software out there to do this. Could this be put into OpenRV? Did the basic stitching together, but haven’t had time to do more. The point is this is what we’re trying to achieve with DPEL, use assets as part of technical conversation about ASWF projects, we want to serve as an example to inspire others. | . | Proposal: Weta large 3D environment . | Kimball: propose building something called “Open Spaces” which will be typical Weta materials. Will have a small edit as well with some animation. Eric: sounds you have tools to dial in the complexity? Kimball: yes, may be a separate component, trying to do scale testing, so might be a useful side component / debugging tool. We also want something visually appealing. | Eric: in early stages of conversation. | . | (2024) New ASC project StEM3-VP: virtual production! . | StEM was in early 2000s, reference materials for digital production. | StEM2 is extended color space example footage, designed to stress a color pipeline. | StEM3 is focussed on Virtual Production, committee working on it is co-chaired by David Morin. Not sure what it will look like. | . | Continue to work with USD-WG and MaterialX . | ALab in DPEL, Chess set in USD Assets | Sometimes an asset will pop up, and we’re not sure where it belongs. | Chess set wasn’t “production scale”, so ended up in USD Assets, whereas ALab belonged in DPEL. | . | Long-standing need (infra): Download statistics . | Donors would like to know if anyone is looking at those files. ASC has been asking about StEM2. | Asking LF IT, but they aren’t really set up about this. We’ve gotten as far as collecting weekly statistics in a CSV and putting them in a folder. | John Mertic was showing some ways to integrate this, looking at using Google Spreadsheet as a visualization interface | . | . | Status . | Phase 1: license, process, TSC | Phase 2: successfully completed . | Useful assets published, under a useful license | 2D and 3D, multiple contributing orgs | To do: download stats | Observation: production-scale test assets | . | Phase 3 = ? . | Wish list: production materials in MaterialX - copy pasta, warts and all | None of the current assets were built for a production, they were built for testing | Moana Island is an example it can be done. | Materials . | Lots of simple materials in DPEL, but nothing you would see on a typical lighter’s screen, would be great to copy paste one of those out of a production, test their software | Materials are also hard to move out of house, there can be custom plugins, data in disk files. It’s going to take some work to do this. But it will promote more development that will help in the long run. | . | Animation . | Noa model is rigged, but doesn’t contain animation | Rigging is the last great “black art” that’s facility specific | . | . | If you have something you wish was in DPEL, or wishing something was in DPEL, there’s a wishlist in the Wiki, post to the Slack and we’ll add it. | Michael: if someone can get something cleared to share, having an animated version of an asset isn’t that much bigger of an ask. Something that’s animated for 10s of seconds would be amazing, since it’s a whole other of performance. It’s hard since you have that data in front of you but you can’t share it. Don’t necessarily need the geometric complexity, but would be great to have assets with non trivial animation. Eric: are you something baked out to frames? Michael: imaging every point on every mesh moving for every frame. Example of Finding Nemo data set animating live at SIGGRAPH Real time Live | . | Adopted Project Review Criteria . | Adopted Stage review criteria | Don’t have a strong feeling about it either way (moving to Adopted stage) | We should probably get our website and download stats sorted out first | . | Michael: we were definitely concerned that we would get a couple of assets and that would be it, have been gratified to see steady contributions. Was great to talk about Weta idea, similar to what Animal Logic did. Using internal tooling to generate a custom asset for the community. If we could get 2-3 of those a year, would make it worth while. | Michael: concern about bitrot, but so far hasn’t been an issue. The ALab asset continues to be relevant and useful. Contributors have continued to make fixes, for instance follow the evolution of USD. | Kimball: can be hard to judge against the CII criteria. | Larry: proposal to move to Adopted stage. Carol: seconded | JF: we just have quorum, 14 out of 25 | All for, no opposes or abstains, motion passes. | Congratulations! Moved on to Accepted Stage | . | Any questions? . | Kimball: very happy this exists | Scott (chat): What’s the story with the Blender short movies? What would need to happen to get some of the shorts added to the DPEL? Michael: We are in conversation with them. Eric: Yes though again, not exactly feature production. | . | David: on the question of how to obtain movie data. For Moana Island, the permission was obtained because Nick Cannon made a case internally, and the studio owned the whole IP. But how to talk to other studios? Michael: most studios don’t have the rights to the IP they would share. Larry: there’s another problem is that it’s one thing to prepare a production scale asset, but extracting an asset from a production is really hard, it has connections to the rest of the show and the facility itself. Michael: Disney showed that it is possible, they managed to do it. David: taking the easiest adjacent case, at Sony / Pixar / Dreamworks animation, who own the assets, is there someone we can approach? Michael: Disney also owns Star Wars… Kimball: the Weta environment scene would use generic assets we build for our own purposes that we can give away. Our target is to do OpenPBR material since that’s a pending release thing, the long term idea is to generate baked animation for a weta character. And release a layer for USD animation once that releases. Also release a best practice guide, and present a way of working with USD, how to have multiple departments contributing to USD entities / assets. Different layers we could contribute over time. | Michael: so we just need to convince the CTO of a company! Kimball: well, a CTO who also attends these meetings! The show asset is always going to be really difficult, would have to be from a studio that owns the content and willing to “go to battle for it”. | Carol: a lot of studios put out short films, could be easier target? Maybe a Pixar short film that wouldn’t be as big battle as a feature length film? | Bill Ballew: would a secondary / background character with animation still be interesting? Might be easier to get clearance for that. We’ve looked at contributing, we got to a lot of props that don’t distinguish the look of our films, but is that valuable? Are background characters worth it? Kimball: it’s usually about whether it can be conveniently converted into something that others can interact with. Bill: was assuming baked geometry. Michael: to get an animated USD shot from Pixar would be really useful, and it would be good for a bunch of uses and testing importing USD data. If we can get cached geometry and materials, that would still be good. Until there’s an OpenRigging format. David: the Moana Island is a recognizable asset from a movie, so that had value. Would be nice to have others, get the legal folks to understand the process. | David: if anyone needs help making those pitches and you think I can help, don’t hesitate to reach out, I can talk to producers, business people… We also have the LF Legal team that can engage with company legal teams if needed. | . | .

Andrew: you SAML SSO credentials are staying live since you are in more LF meetings, whereas others may have them expire. For instance if you are attending TAC meeting every 2 weeks. Not sure what’s the expiration on the SAML login, but likely between 1 and 2 weeks. | John: Down to 6 projects to move over to LFX. Does raw2aces have meetings? Kimball: not really, although now have another contributor, delegating most of it. John: will reach out to remaining 5 projects to move over, it’s relatively painless. Any issues? JT: some groups with a lot of visitors are saying it can be a bit of a pain for infrequent attendees. John: only thing a visitor has to do is put in their name. JT: could be obsolete info. John: we’ve loosened requirements, no more need to create LF account. Kimball: last time I tried (a month or 2 ago) found it difficult to browse and find meetings through LF portal, couldn’t reaily find it if I wasn’t already on the meeting. John: we copy them to the LF Community Calendar, but need to make all the calendars for a project to be able to subscribe as a iCal calendar. Andy: yes, we have that outstanding request, hopefully will get implemented by the team in charge. John: will reach out to remaining projects and move them over. | . | D&amp;I Working Group Project Review- 10/4 #473 . | Postponed by one meeting, OCIO will be Nov 1st (also Carol) | Carol: what’s a good way to keep track of these schedule items? John: email notifications from GitHub issues? But could also ping people a week ahead. I knew about OCIO, but completely lost track of D&amp;I WG. | . | Swag Store feedback #446 . | John: reminder that if you have feedback, please add it there. Yarille is looking at it and making adjustments. Kimball: positive feedback at last meeting, and even some orders. | . | Dev Days Update #476 . | Carol: participant in Dev Days have been hearing a lot from me, so don’t really don’t have that much. Up to 60 registrants, which is a lot. If you get an email from Olga at MPC, she’s helping to manage the effort (she reached out to volunteer). You’ll be getting emails from her, and you will continue to hear from us. Even if you aren’t a project maintainer, if you are interested in volunteering for the event for a period of time and be on hand, we could use folks to monitor the DevDays Slack channels, we want to have coverage for the whole 48H of the event since we have people in other timezones. If you have a few hours, feel free to add yourself to the spreadsheet. You can sign up for a specific project, but also can sign up for general help. | You’ll hear from us about company CLAs, should be fine for companies that already have CLAs in place for some ASWF projects, but concentrating on companies that don’t have any CLAs in place. Trying to make companies aware that this will be required for being able to merge contributions. | Kimball: will there be a cutoff? Some of the people at Weta may not have signed up yet. If we don’t need a cutoff, may not want to? Caroll: since we haven’t listed it up front, we won’t have a hard cutoff, we know that people don’t always prepare ahead of time. We want to encourage people to participate. Kimball: also some people have signed up with personal instead of company emails. Carol: even if they did that, in the registration form we ask for company affiliation, we should be able to figure it out as long as they have filled that field out. | Kimball: excited to see how it goes! Carol: a bit nervous, may be a bit chaotic, but looking forward to it. | . | Project Proposal - OpenQMC #434 . | Kimball: Eric was investigating whether NVIDIA was going to say anything or not, haven’t heard back.

    "content": ". | Annual Review - OpenColorIO - Carol Payne / Doug Walker - ASWF TAC Update - November 2023 . | OpenColorIO ASWF TAC Review 2023 Slides | Can extend if we have more time than 30 minutes today | Feel free to chime in on the slides if you have comments, don’t feel the need to wait until the end since we’ll be jumping around quite a bit | May diverge a bit from standard format | Technical Steering Committee . | 2 new members this year: Thomas Mansecal (WetaFX) and Zack | . | Project Longevity . | Real talk: OCIO looks great from the outside, but we have the same issues as all ASWF / Open Source Projects . | Without the continued sponsorship of Autodesk, the project would likely go back to reading water | Struggle with consistent, dependable involvement (i.e. code reviews) | TSC is made up of many experts, but most aren’t contributing code on a regular basis | Get a decent amount of one-off contributions, but struggle to retain into regular committers | . | Contributors . | LFX Insights dashboard data seems hard to interpret, for instance it mentions 161 contributors which isn’t the case. Can get more info from other graphs, such as commits from new contributors, seems within reason of what we’ve done on the project and number of new contributors. | Ken (chat): The number of commits is a misleading metric of the amount or quality of contributions to a project | We did have 6-7 contributors with Dev Days. | Interested to see if anyone has had similar experience with LFX Insights, is it because our project is too small and it’s designed for larger projects? | . | . | . | SMPTE Workflow Systems Medal . | Accepted by Carol and Doug | Hope to see more open source projects getting this kind of recognition from standards bodies, first time an open source project had won a SMPTE award | David: the address that Carol and Doug did about each other, the foundation, the project, was very generous, well articulated, they were great representatives for all of us and what is happening at ASWF, support for the project from Autodesk. It was well done and heart warming. | . | The past year . | V2 Config Release | V2.2.0 Completed CY 2023 VFX platform release | V2.2.1 ABI compatible features and fixes | January 2023 V2.1.3, V2.0.5: ABI compatible backports | August 15, 2023: Config update v2.0.0 pre-release | August 31, 2023: v2.3.0 CY 2024 VFX Platform release | . | v2.3.x delivered new feature highlights . | … | . | v2.3 - Config Merging Tech Preview . | Releasing this fall as a “tech preview” alongside 2.3 . | Will be available in a separate branch | Gives more time for community review &amp; discussions | Common use-cases . | Enable configs to be built up from components | Allow applications to transparently add required color spaces | Make it simpler to add a LUT to an existing config | . | . | A big workflow change, how does it work when building a VFX pipeline, or a DCC using OCIO. Has lots of potential benefits, but opens up lots of questions for which we don’t have all the answers. As a TSC, could not come to a full consensus on adding this feature as a part of 2.3, so we decided to release it as a tech preview so people can try it out, get feedback, and hopefully answer open ended questions before releasing at next release (2.4) | Wanted to highlight to the TAC as a use case of the TSC, this went down to a vote for people for and against inclusion and we didn’t get consensus, this is what we are trying as a solution. We think there’s value to this approach, but not sure. Looking for feedback from the TAC, see if anyone has opinions on this approach, or share approaches used in other projects: a feature that’s somewhat controversial. This was an interesting challenge to deal with. | . | What’s next (Doug) . | Open Source Roadmaps . | Open source Projects present planning challenges . | Velocity is highly unpredictable . | Volunteers &amp; expertise come and go | . | Apps that have integrated OCIO may have difficulty planning . | What will be the new features &amp; when will they arrive? | . | . | Goal: Develop a roadmap for the fall 2024 release . | Give better visibility into the features under consideration | Identify features that are underway and likely to make the release | Try something new for that release, looking for any wisdom to be shared from other projects. Please reach out to Carol / Doug. | . | . | Future Plans (tentative plans, under consideration) . | Trends of note: . | Increasing importance of web &amp; mobile platforms . | Having a lighter weight version of the library would help | Having JavaScripts bindings would help | . | Demand for pure shader-based transforms without LUTs . | Allocating LUT textures is more costly on lower-end hardware | OCIO is now able to do more without needing LUTs | Can we provide a transform layer that would be easier for implementors to deal with, not having to allocate LUT textures on GPU | . | . | OCIO for web . | Smaller version of library with fewer dependencies | Primarily aimed at GPU processing (shader output) | OCIO.js binding | Some restrictions compared to the full library . | eg probably no FileTransform / LUT support | . | Gordon: is that WebAssembly / cross compiled? Doug: TBD, we haven’t really investigated technical solutions yes. Carol: we have talked about this at SIGGRAPH, talked about Javascript binding, WebAssembly, but no real exploration yet. Gordon: many people are trying to get USD / Hydra as WebAssembly, we depend on OCIO, Hydra stuck between OCIO v1/v2, would be great to get this into WebAssembly, if I can help connect to people working on Hydra, that would be great. Doug: have been talking with people on the Autodesk side, one of the use cases we had in mind. Will follow up with you. | Nick Porcino (chat): Pixar is working on the architecture for color management in USD now. Happy to connect on the topic. - JC Morin: If you want a good example of how to write a JS binding, MaterialX’s JS bindings are a great resource. | . | ACES v2 - top priority, should release early next year | Better integratons with OS-level display color management | Grading workflows / shot-based looks | Common LUT Format (CLF) v4 | Vulkan support | Improved OpenEXR interop | Default Viewing Pipeline enhancements | Improved ACES Metadata File (AMF) support | Config diff tools | . | . | Working Group Updates . | 2 Active working groups: OCIO Config WG and OCIO UX / UI WG | OCIO Configs Working Group . | Started 2-3 years ago | Goal: provide a curated set of color space implementations . | Targetting VFX, animation and games industry | Currently providing several configs (now built-in to the library itself): . | OCIO CG Config for ACES (light-weight, minimal collection for CG) | OCIO Studio Config for ACES (full ACES, for compositing &amp; post production) | . | These configs provide ACES as well as other commonly used spaces . | The non-ACES spaces are for texturing, linear camera spaces, etc | . | . | Config Methodology . | Naming / Version Control . | studio-config-v2.0.0_aces-v1.3_ocio-v2.3.ocio . | v2.0.0 : config version | v1.3 : ACES version | v2.3 : OCIO library version | . | . | ACES-based, but not bound . | Some exclusions: . | Certain Output Transforms (ex: DCDM) | Superseded Input Transforms (ex: SLog1, REDLogFilm) | ACESproxy | Old ACES Emulations | . | Some additions: . | sRGB texture spaces | Utility linear spaces | . | . | . | . | . | OCIO Color Interop Forum . | Goal: encourage color space interop across industry projects . | The Configs WG already includes a variety of stakeholders . | ACES, camera vendors, exports from VFX, animation, games, post | . | But would like broader participation . | Other ASWF projects, OpenUSD, more app developers | . | Aiming to coordinate discussions around color space support . | What is the list of color spaces, how should they be named, etc | . | Looking for advice about how to get more people involved . | Particularly those not currently using OCIO | Validate some of what Doug / Carol / Thomas Mansecal / Kevin Wheatley have been working on | Would be different to how we are currently running a WG | . | Do we need another completely separate config for a different workflow | Would like to get feedback from TAC, want agenda items brought to us, rather than us setting the agenda. Bring OCIO ACES v2 config questions… | Doug: this is possibly broader than OCIO: color management support in various applications and workflows, we would like them to use OCIO, but even if they don’t, people want to create workflows. So we need interop between projects and applications, and thus broaden the scope of the group to even people who aren’t using the OCIO configs. | . | . | Gordon: is the ask from the TAC “here’s what we need, process, blessing”, what would you like to get from the TAC? You’ve done amazing things with the project, in general, what are your asks of ASWF. Carol: we’re asking for ‘blessing’, this is something we are taking up as leader of the effort, we can get into details of where this is hosted, what calendar is it on, does it make sense, does it address color issues in your projects? Doug: there’s been discussion about other ASWF projects that are interested in color management adopting OCIO / improving their color management. Interop between ASWF projects is an interesting subject for the TAC to discuss, how that should best be done. There are probably other areas outside color where we could improve interop between projects. Also how to publicize that, that the ASWF is setting up a cross project interop WG, and want to invite stakeholders to participate. Gordon: in the spirit of not taking ages to make decision, OCIO is the flagship color spokesperson in ASWF. I would like to move a motion that the TAC supports you and blesses this approach. Can we do this without Kimball? David: please go ahead, we can do this as a motion of support, before we do that, a few notes from experience. We have a lot of projects in the foundation, at beginning of OCIO presentation, presented that it can be hard to get new contributors. So if we add a new project (which is totally valid), perhaps it would be good to further define its mission, and perhaps define a first, short time deliverable. If the color interop forum is to deliver something in first 6 months, it would help focus the minds of people, help people joining not to feel they are joining a long running, ongoing project. Could provide a milestone from the start? Gordon: wasn’t thinking of it as a project, more a forum that OCIO can use to engage with a broader set of stakeholders. How should we characterize it? Is it an independent project, or a forum that OCIO uses? Carol: the latter, don’t want to downplay the amount of work. For me it’s the continuation of the Configs WG, broadening its scope. So more work, but we feel it’s the natural continuation of work. The Configs are stabilizing, they will need to keep being developed, but not as much huge develop effort. We need more to know if they are being used, what the next steps should be. So information and feedback gathering, making that work cross project, which will turn into more development work. Gordon: encouraged that you would take it on, want to encourage going forward. Yarille: do we have quorum? JF: 11 present, 15 not present, so we do not. Yarille: we can do this as a email vote. Gordon: maybe we need more info we want to see first before email vote goes out? Carol: happy to put things in writing. Yarille: yes, can attach to email. Gordon: it seems like it’s an iterative process. Yarille: will include presentation and minutes in email. Carol: will provide statement afterwards. | Eric R: creating an ASWF ecosystem, how do the projects interact. This comes up in OTIO, it’s natural that people see how OTIO can carry around information, want to lean on domain expertise in other projects. A separate thing we might consider instead of a regular cadence WG, could have a once or twice a year ASWF Interop Summit. Carol: more and more crossover between projects, so would support that. The TAC is a good place, but our agendas are full. David: do we hold this interop forum at our conferences / open source forum in Feb / Open Source Days at SIGGRAPH? Eric: yes, would be good to hold in those contexts, but could eat up 1/2 or full day, so not sure. Maybe try something smaller first. David: great idea, evolve our events to include forums like this. | Jonathan: want to support OCIO color interop. In my mind could be an expansion of the scope of what OCIO could be in the future, could be more than just a code base, but a standardization of color spaces. Does that sound like what you are thinking about? Would align with conversations happening in USD / MaterialX spaces, an expansion of what OCIO could be in the future. Doug: OCIO has had close collaboration with ACES project, we’ve relied on ACES to define color spaces, with OCIO being a way to implementing them. Something we should have some discussions in collaboration with ACES leadership to make sure we are aligned on purpose. Specific goal right now is interop between colorspaces that already exist, and practical aspects of how do you communicate color space information between different applications. We want to be careful how we describe scope and objectives to take that into account. Jonathan (Chat): The USD color architecture will likely be common to USD and MaterialX, so we’d love to join this conversation. This may be a great place to talk about how people should think about OCIO and AMF in the same world | Eric: in the work we’ve been doing at Netflix, would love a library of mutually agreed upon color transforms to get between spaces. Take the discussion out of that, instead of having to reinvent it all the time. Carol: we would like to dig into examples, we do have for colorspaces that have open definitions, a large set of transforms which should be representative. We’ve talked about how we can add to that, it’s not a standard, it’s our implementation of the standard. | Gary (Chat): OpenFX is also very interested in this kind of color interop. It’s an active discussion topic for us. | Doug: as to AMF, this is something we’re working on actively in OCIO to go beyond last year’s prototype. | Carol: question from Gordon as to what’s most important to use. We incredibly benefit from all the work being put into CI working group, whatever we can do to continue to fund this, GPU runners are essential. We have people who participate in that group, but we aren’t necessarily experts. That’s huge for us, probably biggest point on the list to “give more resources”. That would be our #1 ask. Also small requests around LFX Insights, small notes and nudges, would need some help on how to better use this. LF putting lots of effort into it. | Doug: completely agree, work of CI working group has been super helpful, we also leverage Emily’s work for marketing. | Carol: continuing initiatives to bring new developers is important, build on Dev Days, other learning initiatives. Having events specific to the foundation that are catered to our unique industry is important, make the events repeatable. Bring in contributors interested in this industry, rather than wider efforts. | Gordon: great to hear about importance of CI WG, would be great to get a debrief on how we think Dev Days went. | David: thank you for all the great work OCIO, and the idea of the crossover forum. | . | .

Kimball has done it for 3 years, Daniel before. If someone is interested, Kimball would be happy to yield. Goal would be to dig into this in meeting on the 29th, see if we need to open up an election | . | Hosted Projects Resource Request Process #461 (Darin Grant) . | A bit of a repeat to presentation to Governing Board, looking at next year’s budget | ASWF has a reasonable surplus, around $900K | We are growing membership, and thus revenue | Want the business as usual running to fit within revenue to maintain surplus | Why maintain a surplus? Rather than business as usual to eat into surplus, want to make sure TAC can give guidance of what we should invest in. Invest based on TAC (or Governing Board) requests, for instance D&amp;I efforts. Want a clear process for anyone from the TAC or projects to request ASWF to invest in. | Link to proposal | Budget committee meets once a month to review and approve | Examples: infrastructure needs, skill needs, good | John: some requests may require funding on the back end, or bring in a tool or skill we already have in Linux Foundation, sometimes there are similar needs from different foundations. | Darin: there’s a large portion of budget dedicated to IT services, can be a bit opaque, that team wrote up what they actually do as a result of this funding, looking at that gives an idea what’s in scope for funding. | Darin: was really insightful in understanding what is done, for instance how to get AWS, GitHub credits (LF IT/RE Services Key Contributions document, document link to follow) | Ben Giles: currently working on Wayland color management, how do we help that effort? Darin: that’s a request for spend, we steer away from bug bounties or things like that. What form would such a resource request be? Ben: as part of VFX Reference Platform, maybe a SIG under that organization, dealing with transition from X11 to Wayland. If Caligara was to drive this effort, what sort of resources could we have access to, for instance a GSoC like effort? | John: this process is designed for project currently under ASWF. How to bring a new effort under ASWF, and what would be resources available? | Ben: we started an effort, some talk previously. It’s about continuing that effort, what would it look like concretely. David: would this be the workstation working group? Ben: yes, Workstation Experience group as well. We would be willing to help drive both of these efforts, including hiring people. But would need requirements and advice, something to work towards. We want it to be a cross industry effort. | Darin: Working Group structure in ASWF is likely the right place for such an effort. Ben: that seems indeed like the right place. John: will follow up. | JF: expect requests for new CI runner types: Apple Silicon, ARM Linux, GPU, larger runners… | Darin: hopefully LF pull can help reduce the cost | John: Andrew Grimberg has been working with GitHub to gain beta (free for now) access to new runners. Also was able to work with AWS for DPEL to get cloud requests, equivalent to around $25K of AWS credits, helps to offset other areas of the budget. | John: as you may have resource needs, we often have access to those resources, we have existing agreements we can leverage so we can get those services for our projects | John: if you come to us first, we can often help, combine efforts, tap into other work the LF is doing | Darin: skill need: JT mentioned in chat for-pay testing services. Documentation another possible area. Could also use project management skills, these could all be interesting to explore. | John: we tend not to advise projects to hire direct development staff, tends to stifle the ability of a project to scale, costs are high. But specialty needs can often tap into existing skills: documentation, training, events. QA and Project Management could be interesting to explore, some of our larger foundations have “community architects”. If there’s a broad need out there, we could figure out what that looks like. That’s what I’ve seen most success with, less so with dev resources. | John: will package this and present it to the board for approval, hoping to have process up in running in next few weeks. | . | Guidance/input to Apple re: Uniform Type Identifiers for the various ASWF projects - they are akin to MIME types (Druv Govil / Michael B. Johnson . | Apple looking for guidance on naming convention for Uniform Type Identifiers | Druv: on Apple platforms, we use MIME types at the system level identifiers: com.pixar.universalscenedescription | Was hoping to register something like io.aswf.materialx for instance, but is there an alternate naming convention? Normally it’s the opposite of the web site order | Currently OpenEXR is com.ilm.open-exr | Anyone has thoughts? Is io.aswf correct? | Eric R: on OTIO we’ve done tinkering with MEME, we’ve used opentimeline.io, would be nice to have guidance on what we want to do generally, brings up the question of what a project does in the future if it leaves the aswf?

    "content": ". | John: Kimball unable to make this meeting | OpenQMC: we are getting closer, trying to get wording in place with folks from Framestore. If anyone from TAC interested in reviewing the wording, please reach out to Eric E. | John: two projects left to join LFX, just OpenEXR and OpenCue. Some issues with Outlook, meetings off by 30 minutes, please file a support ticket, there may be a “legitimate” issue. Outlook seems a bit quirky, would be good if we can get those issues debugged with LF support. If you login to the web site, you will see the canonical version of your calendar. | Schedule for TAC for next two months affected by Holidays and LF offsite . | Meeting on December 13th as is | Cancel 27th December | Meeting January 10th as is | January 22nd overlaps with LF offsite, any objection to cancelling it? | Resume normal schedule on 2024-02-07 (or 08?) | . | Will be sending out a joint maintainer / contributor survey, renamed as “stakeholder survey”, opened for all of December. Will do some analysis and publish results. Hoping to have better data, get feedback on programs, want to run it every 6 months and try to track trends around satisfaction. Look for announcement, wide scope of respondents | Renewal of Industry Representative status (JF / VES Technology) . | We do not have quorum | Yarille will run vote over email | No concern over renewing | . | TAC chair renewal, usually after the beginning of the year. Kimball has been doing it for a couple of years, he’s open to someone else doing it. Please reach out to John if you are interested, what it means / what it’s about. If we have multiple interested people, we will have an election. | Waiting for OpenColorIO deck for the vote on a couple of things: . | Annual renewal vote? John: it’s more a formality than anything else. Yarille: we didn’t have quorum at the time. Carol: sent you the slides, should be enough for that vote. | OCIO asking for a separate vote about a new concept, a WG under OCIO which has cross project interop involved, wanted to get TAC approval for this effort, or a statement of support of how OCIO is thinking of approaching. Carol: thought I needed a written proposal for that. | But the slides are enough for the OCIO renewal vote. John: don’t really need to vote on something OCIO wants to do within its mandate. Carol: no problem with that. | . | rawtoaces pushed to future | OpenSFF Best Practices . | John: GH Issue with more content | Jonathan: we’ve allowed a bit of a split to develop between what we perceive as an adopted at ASWF vs the technical goals we have stated are requirements. OpenEXR and OSL should obviously be adopted projects, their relevance to the industry justifies their adoption, but they don’t meet the technical requirements we have set, and that’s something we should fix. Makes it hard to judge new projects against these criteria. The example brought up was the Gold OpenSFF badge, we want all adopted projects to be making project towards, but since no project has achieved it, it seems not a good approach to hold projects to that requirement. | MaterialX is working towards Silver badge, which would be followed by a Gold badge, but requiring a Gold badge before a project can be adopted seems a problem. Only 10 open source projects have achieved a Gold badge. We should make the requirement progress towards Gold. | John: historical projects that were adopted before we changed the requirements were grandfathered in, but there should be a level of consistency. | Anyone else interested in chiming in? | Carol: is Gold currently a requirement to become an adopted project? John: yes, it was changed when we added the Sandbox stage. Carol: didn’t realize this, we should drop it down to Silver. Jonathan: it is a hard requirement, but seems many didn’t realize this, especially the projects that were initially adopted before the requirement was added. | Jonathan: link to requirements. We voted in OSL to Adopted status without having met either Silver or Gold badge requirements. | John: Gold Level requirements | JC: don’t we have a loosened version of badges from ci-wg discussions? We tried to help with those requirements, and perhaps lower the bar on some requirements like code coverage percentage, 90% being very hard to reach, and other problematic issues such as reproducible builds. We had talked about having our “own” version of badges. | John: we tried to add more context around some of the requirements, code coverage was a specific one. One of the questions was around conditional builds / hardware / platform dependencies. The compromise would be that if you don’t have access to the hardware for testing, you can back off automated testing for platforms you don’t have access to. | John: also some exceptions around reproducible builds. JC: yes, that’s my recollection as well. | John: are there other problematic requirements? JC: code signing, Rez and MaterialX is looking into it. | Jonathan: these are all worthwhile goals, but not all goals are worth holding projects up to. Carol: not fair to hold projects from being adopted just for not meeting a Gold standard when none of the existing adopted projects have achieved that. | John: is there a desire to get some of the historical projects to that level, or does the group think the Gold requirements are not relevant? | Nick: different people may have different interpretations of the requirements, we should have a survey at the TAC level, make a spreadsheet across all projects, without a dashboard it will be difficult to make progress. John: a central effort coordinated by the TAC? Nick: yes, if done at the TSC level, it will fight for other priorities. Carol: a lot of the TSC members know that this is important, but are not SMEs in security for instance, so hard to evaluate the time commitment, what needs to happen to meet the requirements. Most of the projects don’t have this kind of talent (especially for security issues). Makes it hard to prioritize it. OpenEXR is different since it is exposed in other contexts (part of OS). OCIO should work towards this, but how do we prioritize it against all the other requirements. We don’t have extra dev cycles, so is the ASWF TAC asking projects to remove resources from features to meeting these requirements. Until the TAC gives a mandate and a deadline, it won’t happen. Nick: every time a security requirement is brought up, it is suggested that a TSC member should take training to get certified in security, but we don’t have this time to dedicated. | John: would specific steps to be accomplished something that would help give clarity to the TSCs? We would make this explicit to avoid ambiguity / interpretation. | Erik N: it always helps to know the scope of the problem. Would it be a good exercise for the TAC to figure out which projects have the highest security exposure and understand the scope of that exposure. Build a plan to focus on highest priority. | Eric E: could change acceptance requirement from overall badge to specific requirements? John: the badges are a framework around project operation, if you have these infrastructure pieces in place, it doesn’t mean you’ve solved all your security problems, it means you’ve put the processes in place. But it’s not just security, it’s also project sustainability in general. One big challenge is that we’re splitting hairs instead of having specific requirements / steps to take to make progress. For instance requirement for uninstalling. Some of that may be a next level thing to look at, pick out the stuff that doesn’t matter. | Nick (Chat): Silver is incompatible with reasonable usage of cmake. “The project MUST provide a way to easily install and uninstall the software produced by the project using a commonly-used convention. {N/A justification} {Met “ | Erik N: do projects use security scanning tools? John: not sure we have done that formally. Jonathan: most of our projects use static and dynamic analysis, some of the issues get flagged by those scans. Most of our projects already run those scans, and there are aspects of the badges that cover those requirements. I do think that many of the recommendations in the OpenSFF badges are good, and our project has benefited from the testing requirements. It’s more using the Gold badge as a gate we should step away from, and none of our projects have passed that. | Erik N: sounds like the badge needs to be underpinned by clearly measurable metrics, and projects should have to undergo a periodic review to maintain the badge. Jonathan: but none of our projects have achieved a Gold badge, so maintenance is in the future! | John: this could be covered in the annual review process, could be plugged into there. | Jonathan: Passing badge in OpenSFF has strong ASWF goals, and it’s a good requirement for Incubation stage. Achieving that badge was revelatory for MaterialX, and was very useful. | Erik R: OTIO has adopted a “federation of repos” approach, we have a core repo, then separate repos for GUI apps, adapters… Those other repos aren’t the primary project, separate. Do we have to hold all those things to the same standard, or does it only apply to OTIO core? | John: although wg-ci has done some work, sounds like there’s “next level” analysis of the requirements needed. Seems like a missing piece that’s complicating things. | Carol: I think this would be helpful to have projects continue to work towards those requirements, these are “good things to do”, no one is really arguing against that, except for requirements that aren’t achievable. Signed releases may not make sense for some projects for instance. How do we help existing accepted projects to make projects towards Gold badge, and how to we come up with clear steps to get there. But the other discussion should be to remove the Gold badge requirement to become an adopted project. We’re likely to adopt project in the future no matter what. | John: seems to make sense, what is the requirement for adopting a project? There seems to be different directions for this evaluation. We could go one for a long time, but we don’t have quorum. Where I have seen a challenge is that when you are in a subjective area, there’s not a clear outline of how to get there. How could we measure characteristics so a project and see if it’s ready. Jonathan: could the tweak to the language to be to “have made notable project towards a Gold badge”. We would be stating that the Gold badge is aspirational, have made progress about Passing badge (JF: what about Silver?). The other requirements we have placed around project relevance and acceptance are already capture well. | JF: does the TAC still have a role to influence adopted level projects? | John: there can be “progress” after Adopted level. Could the TAC set an expectation that a certain amount of time after adoption a project reaches a specific requirement. There are still strides and improvements a project can make after adoption? | Carol: passing should be the guideline for adoption, and we need something clear and measurable requirements from projects, especially around reviews | John: this has been a good discussion, will start a PR to capture where I think everyone is at, will share with the group, we can continue the discussion and if we get some alignment, we can review at the next meeting. We can go back to ci-wg to come up with a practical guide on how to achieve there requirements for project, take the work we did and get it into more concrete steps. | Jonathan: this sounds great, the concrete change that would make the most sense would be to make sure that all adopted projects meet the requirements we set. | John: will take a stab at putting something together in time for next meeting. | . | Agenda of upcoming reviews may be reshuffled to get OTIO come before OpenEXR and give a full meeting per project review | .

OTIO maintainers can contribute to them, but we want to focus on OTIO core | . | OTIO format transition . | Progress from legacy editorial formats to OTIO | We feel we’ve reached a tipping point of having OTIO in the conversation | . | 2023 Ecosystem Highlights . | Lots of help from the community on CI/CD improvement and updated C++ adoption | AVID hosted an OTIO breakfast table at HPA 2022 | Mention in MovieLabs Interoperability in Media Creation white paper | MovieLabs created a demo of their cloud pipeline vision built around OpenTimelineIO, OpenAssetIO and RV | OTIO Vendor Working Group starting to take form | . | OTIO Vendor Working Group . | Meets at NAB and IBC each year | Started with an Adobe-hosted discussion at IBC 2022 and has become a forum to align vendors on a shared standard for timeline interchange | At the IBC 2023 meeting, Adobe passed the torch to Avid to lead for the group | A rotating cast of OTIO TSC members attend when possible | Represents a promising model where the TSC and Vendor Working Group can collaborate to align the project goals and vendor goals | Align needs of studios and vendors | Eric E: why are there two groups? What’s the difference? Eric: we’ve seen this come up when vendors want to talk about how they need to put their proprietary data in OTIO, we’re happy to talk with vendors on how to do that, do we really want to create standards Effects. There are some things the TSC can address, but we don’t necessarily want to tell vendors what to do. It felt a bit more comfortable to do it this way. Also may be somewhat cultural, the way Open Source software works and the way commercial software works is a bit different. This also allows vendors to avoid committing to roadmaps. This is a good question, and think about why we have 2 groups. David: having the followed the progress of this group, Adobe started it, created a meeting at IBC 2 years ago, other vendors like Avid had heard about OTIO, but questions were general. Other companies joined like Autodesk, more at the product manager level. Interaction at a higher level is a good thing to have, might be a bit too “fluffy” for the TSC, but good to have an adjacent place where you can have a different type of conversation at the business / product management level, and have Ben Schofield bring requirements back to TSC. | Eric E: Jeff Hodges from Adobe has been in every one of these meetings, and will report notes back to TSC. For instance a “fluffy” line item was the idea of creating booth badging to demonstrate support for OTIO. So not something that would be addressed at the TSC level. | Carol: this fits in the model of other projects, I see similarities with the OCIO UX/UI WG, attended by implementation engineers, what’s discussed there is very different than what’s discussed in TSC. Someone from TSC always attends those meetings and reports back. As project grow, it’s normal to have more than just one meeting. Also follows the ACES development mentality, where they have a separate architecture meeting / group, separate from implementation group. Eric: thank you for the feedback from OCIO, this is very helpful. | Josh: vendors are much more focussed on broadcast industry, whereas ASWF is more SIGGRAPH than NAB/IBC. So may not be simple for TSC members to attend NAB / IBC meetings. This is why we asked Jeff Hodges to join our TSC, and can represent TSC. | David: we heard other projects like OpenFX have a lot of activities in broadcast, so will expand ASWF activities at NAB, HPA Tech Retreat, and possibly IBC | . | Vendor Adoption . | Now available with native OTIO support: . | Blackmagic Design: DaVinci Resolve | Colorfront: Transkoder | DNEG: xStudio | . | Announced in progress: . | Adobe Premiere Pro | . | Already shipping: . | Nuke Studio, Hiero, RV, cineSync Play, Cezanne, Matchbox, tlRender, etc . | Nuke Studio demonstrated OTIO round tripping | . | . | . | 2024 Focus . | Complete Adapter break-out release | Continue supporting application integrators | Documentation scrub . | Not just communicating with developers | . | High demand schema enhancements . | Source Media Stream / Channel selection | Progress towards color effects | . | . | ASWF Project Lifecycle . | Incubation -&gt; Adopted . | Missing: using an ADOPTERS file or showcased on the project’s website | . | . | Best Practices Badge . | Stuck 82% complete | Stuck on “The project MUST have a least one primary developer who knows how to design secure software” | Also Code Analysis requirements. Jean-Christophe has done a lot of work but his (and our) time is constrained. Hit some roadblocks with code cleanliness, LFX security integration. | Would be helpful to get help / resources on that. | . | Requests for Help from TAC 2022 . | TAC members, please ask for active OTIO participation from: . | Apple - Final Cut Pro X Team | Adobe - Premiere Pro team, established | Avid - Media Composer Team, established | BMD - DaVinci Resolve, DONE | . | . | Requests for Help from TAC 2023 . | OpenSFF badges | . | . | Any questions? . | Eric E: very impressed with vendor adoption. Do we have a sense of studio adoption? . | Eric R: OTIO may be used in more places that we think / know. It’s been tough to get a feel for that. Disney Feature Animation may be working on this? Josh: yes, this is in progress. Eric: Animal Logic did a presentation on their adoption. Netflix is increasing its use every day. If you hear interesting rumblings about studios using OTIO, we want to hear about it. Also AMPAS has a WG on archival, and have been talking about OTIO to recommend as the archival format for timeline information. | Larry: great presentation. All projects have the same problem if knowing what it gets built into. In past couple of days, there’s been a conversation surrounding on long / short / nomination for VFX Oscar, maybe we can get info on what packages got used on what projects. Maybe easier to ask about all projects together rather than asking piecemeal. Eric R: both encouraging and disappointing. But it makes sense to ask about all projects. Eric E: support that if anyone knows what projects where used on the long list. Larry: no one has replied unfortunately. It’s a side convo on the OSL channel, but will move it somewhere else. David: would be great to be able to come to Open Source Forum with a list before the ceremony, would be a great tool for promotion and to elevate the work we do and show the range. Show how critical our projects are to the motion picture industry. | Eric E: sounds like OTIO has been adopted by vendors and studios, what would people consider about moving to adopted stage. Not trying to belittle the requirements? | Eric R: from project perspective would really like this. John: this is has been an ongoing conversation on the badging requirements site, a lot of requirements needing clarification. Don’t think we can resolve this in 2 minutes. Would like to get a straw poll about looking at current requirements that are giving projects the most confusion on how to achieve, and perhaps boxing those out for the time being until we can get clarity, and keeping those aside from requirements for adopted stage, and reintroduce them later and give help projects. Would this generally help? | Eric E: it’s adopted when we say its adopted? | Carol: is 82% to passing or Gold? Eric R: it’s to Passing. OSL had achieved passing. I would like to “Adopt” OTIO today, but maybe we do a bit more work around this. | John: I bet we can look through requirements, quickly eyeball a half dozen that are most problematic, block those out for now, I’ve talked with OpenSFF project, they want to find paths to help our projects better achieve those requirements. Let’s work through those details and incorporate feedback into requirements. We don’t want to hold people in purgatory. | Larry: I would not advocate dropping security requirements, but they could be separated than the status of going from incubated from adoption. Once a package is built in to all the major apps, studios, if that’s not “Adopted”, what do words even mean? Maybe we have a separate “suitable for security” status. John: maybe we’ve overloaded the “adopted” term. | Nick: we don’t want to keep projects in “purgatory”. We’ve been having this conversation for very long on OTIO, I’d like to be “adopted” before I retire. Maybe we can work towards end of March adoption, are we going to have this conversation next year? John: I think we can move fast. I think within the badge there’s a couple of requirements that are adding a lot of unclarity, let’s identify those. I’ve walked some project leads through those, sometimes projects are already doing requirements, or can do it trivially. Let’s box out the problematic ones, figure out how to address them, and deal with problems on how to address them. It’s not a bad idea, but it’s not clear how to get there. And now block transition to adopted stage. Hopefully process of clarity will make it simple to do. Hopefully an outcome that will work. | Carol: but we we just want to get OTIO over Passing, no other project is at Gold (or even Silver). John: analysis from JF spreadsheet, or projects are probably already hitting all of those. When we get into the more practical, there’s a handful we have issues with. | Nick: would like to have dates attached to it. John: can we work through this on next TAC meeting, identity the ones we want to box out? That should be a straightforward process. Larry: there are other projects that got to passing, so they can give advice. Eric R: there’s a mix of issues, for instance documenting security issue reporting is not easy. But static analysis is less simple, and it’s been hard to find time to spend on those. Also not the strong point of our developers. John: also unclear what’s “good enough”. | Eric R: what if we could together work through some of those points, and maybe that would give us an idea of what’s needed to be done. John: yes we can sync over next couple weeks. | . | . | . | . ",

Also special tags for documentation, “more difficult”. Hoping this can be a good tool, potentially for dev days as well. | Please reach out if you have questions | . | OpenSSF badging . | Thank you to all the projects who have made project | Spreadsheet has been updated | We’re starting to identify requirements we may be able to waive at this point | Identified requirements that are most difficult to meet | We may not have the time to make final determination on these items here, we can discuss this on the Slack, and take a vote | Carol: there’s a couple we may not want to cancel out and insist they get done. The main issue for some projects is that we haven’t event looked at the Gold requirements, we’re at 70% of Silver badge, but haven’t really looked at the Gold since still working on Silver. Some of the Gold requirements may not be all that difficult to achieve. | John: I can extract the “3 and above” line items, and we can figure out which are those are achievable. | No requirement to do them in order, but I can see why it was done that way. | Jonathan: MaterialX has been focussed on Silver badge since that seemed achievable (96%), haven’t been looking as closely to Gold badge. | Cary: have been looking at “low hanging fruit”, easy to knock off. Carol: we haven’t been approaching it that way, but can switch methodology and see if we can achieve some of those Gold items. | Andrew: if CloTributor is getting turned on, you will meet one of the requirements for Gold. | John: now that we have a different focus for guidance, would it make sense to wait until next TAC meeting to take another pass to tick off “low hanging fruit” Gold items? | Carol: how many projects have time to make progress on Silver? | Larry: a goal for the next meeting would be to get rid of the question marks, only met / unmet / not applicable. Don’t be afraid to mark something as unmet. We don’t necessarily know what is difficult because there are too many unfilled items. | Larry: the form itself is a bit confusing, there some ambiguity between “unmet” as “we haven’t done it” vs “unmet” as “not applicable”. But we should just mark everything as “unmet”. | Cary: I don’t have comment access to spreadsheet? John: no, update the form, and I have a script to pull from the backend database. I did tag people in the spreadsheet. | Cary: some issues like i18n, for OpenEXR we will say we meet that, but someone may disagree. If I can put forward an argument that we meet a requirement that I believe holds water, I will say “met” until someone reviews it. | John: it’s really based on honor system. | Action item: change ? to something else | . | MaterialX Annual Review (Jonathan) . | MaterialX Annual Review Slides | 2nd Annual Review | Started at ILM in 2012 | First used on Force Awakens in 2015 | Industry collaborations . | Autodesk | . | Technical Steering Committee . | 15 members representing 11 companies . | Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, Epic, IKEA, ILM, Khronos, NVIDIA, Pixar, SideFX, SPI | 5 voting members, 10 stakeholders | 56 meetings since joining ASWF | . | . | MaterialX Contributors by Year . | major spike this year, likely due to Dev Days, thank you to the team (8 - 10 contributors) | others are industry members (40 unique contributors) | Seems like we want to maximize diversity of contributors and companies | . | New MateriaX integrations by Year . | Apple Vision Pro | Chaos VRay | Autodesk 3DS Max | Autodesk (?) | . | Notable events . | OpenPBR Surface . | A new open surface shading model, organized as a subproject of MaterialX | Developed in collaboration with Adobe and Autodesk | Currently at v.02 with a production release planned this year | . | Open MaterialX Graph Editors . | The first two open-source graphical editors for MaterialX content . | MaterialX Graph Editor, developed by Emma Holthouser at Lucasfilm, based on ImGui | Quiltix Graph Editor developed by Prism Pipeline, base on Hydra | . | . | Metal Shading Language . | Apple contributed support for Metal Shading Language (MSL) | A key component of the MaterialX integration for VisionOS | Early days of Apple/MaterialX collaboration | . | New Pattern Nodes . | Autodesk and SideFX contributed a new set of pattern nodes | Defined as graphs of existing primitives, so no new client code is required | Now integrated into Houdini 20 | . | . | Area of focus for 2024 . | Improvements to MaterialX for OpenPBR (BSDF nodes, layering rules) | Improvements to USD / MaterialX integration (color spaces, versioning). Hoping it can become a new material archival format (digital backlot) | Initial non-photorealistic rendering library. Working with community to design this. | New USD Materials Working Group within the AOUSD. Design the spec for how MaterialX materials should behave in USD. Jonathan and Anders Langland at NVIDIA leading WG | . | Progress on OpenSSF Badge . | Silver Badge: 96% | Gold Badge: 65% | Raised C++ coverage to 88%, though rendering modules are not yet included (can’t run those tests under GH Actions for now) | Two security requirements remain for Silver Badge | . | We got a lot of energy from Dev Days and want to be part of it again. | Questions? . | David: want to use your slide on number of contributors and feedback on Dev Days at Open Source forum. If any projects showing spike after Dev Days, would like to use that as well. Will have big emphasis on Dev Days and Summer Learning Program to encourage development of new engineers. | Carol: for next Dev Days, want better ways to track contributions. But this is the good example to pull out. Jonathan: yes, it was very clear that this is valuable. | Carol: anything you need from the TAC or LF? Jonathan: we want to become an Adopted project, that would be really good! Larry: that project has had real world impact, even outside the industry! | . | John: vote to renew? Larry can we vote to also graduate? John: we can vote based on the badge? Larry: trying to replicate what we did with OSL. Gordon: all of our projects are compliant? Larry: no, none are since we’ve upped the requirements. Carol: that was the discussion with OTIO and others, consensus was that we want to adopt all the projects, but want to do our due diligence first, then make exceptions if we have to. But can be argued both ways. I would be good with a “conditional” adoption. Chris: they are far along, and can be an example for all. John: so does someone want to motion conditional approval? | JF: unfortunately we don’t have quorum (14 voting members present, 20 absent) | . | Swift WG Proposal (Tyler Furby) . | Swift WG Proposal Slides | Proposing both Switch and C/C++ interoperability between the many projects across the ASWF landscape while exploring… | Built 13 projects across the ASWF without a single line of CMake through the tooling of SPM enabled by C++ interoperability in Swift 5.9 | Requires zero of very minor changes to existing libraries for this to work | 0% CMake, 100% Switch Package Management | Goals . | Collaboration with the ASWF to allow existing projects and libraries to be consumed by the Switch Package Manager in the form of Package.swift files at project roots | Availability of plugins, and other tooling to aid in bringing existing libraries to SPM | Creating safe, easy to use… | . | Non Goals . | Existing C/C++ libraries should not be modified, or modified very little (acceptable minor changes would be in the form of moving C++ includes out of namespace blocks) or adding clang attributes to existing classes and types | Rewriting existing C/++ or Python code into Switch | Supporting versions of Swift prior to Swift 5.9 for CXX libraries | . | Deliverables . | Universal Scene Description USD for the Swift programming language, SwiftUSD | Monolithic Swift Package dependency (MetaverseKit) which successfully builds 13 existing ASWF projects, including dependencies of these libraries such as TBB and Python | Make MetaverseKit monolithic Switch package obsolete through industry adoption of Swift Package… | . | Support . | Wabi Foundation (@wabiverse), an American nonprofit organization dedicate to fostering the evolution of Swift and the language in which it interoperates with across the industry and open-source Metaverse | Dedicated engineers at the direction of the industry | . | Questions . | JF: would WG take on CI? Tyler: yes would help with CI, including making sure not to break other OSes. Tyler: we wouldn’t be adding anything to the official projects. Will want to coordinate with project maintainers, just needs a single file in the root, can add a GitHub Action workflows. Projects who don’t want to add that, we could add the official project as a submodule so it doesn’t touch the official project. | Ben Giles: is there something across the projects you are able to build without any changes? C only bindings? Tyler: USD had a couple of namespaces in includes, but not sure if any ASWF projects had this, mostly TBB and Python. It went pretty smoothly. It was possible to change things without affecting linkage. Ben: why a Swift specific WG instead of a FFI (Foreign Function Interface) base WG? Tyler: both sound good, so that could be an approach as well. Ben: not saying Swift is not important, but our customers all have different languages they like to use internally. Tyler: yes, an interesting point. | . | John: we can take vote to mailing list since we don’t have quorum. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | CLOTributor . | Rez has had a couple of “drive by” contributions | 74 ASWF issues tagged on CLOtributor | Anything with help-wanted tag without someone assigned to it, can add additional tags | Already got value out of it | . | FMX 2024 Open Source Track . | Emily: starting to fill out speaker list, if you are planning to go to FMX and want to present, let me know. Doesn’t have to be related to a ASWF project, but has to be open source | David: if a TAC member isn’t going to FMX but someone in your company who has been working on a project / familiar with the work and could speak, please let us know. We want to gather a group of open source people who are active in the field for a panel, not necessarily having to prepare a presentation | . | Security Threat Model . | Trying to get some security support for our project | Working with the Open Source Security Improvement Fund | Can help with making “threat models” for a project, not as in depth as a full security audit, but can help figure out what to concentrate on. | Example for the Eclipse Mosquito project | If you are a TSC lead, please take a look at this, could something like this be useful to your project? Could it help with your security posture? Would also help with security audits. But please take a look at what got done. | JF: is there a ballpark as to how much this would cost? John: doing a security audit with another project, a deeper audit, around $50K. A threat model analysis should be less than that. Also opportunities to group several projects in a single engagement. Don’t worry too much about the cost, will try to be as efficient as possible. Would an analysis like this be useful? Many of the TSC Chairs are unclear of how to approach security, could be a tool to give a pragmatic place to start. Cary: would love to read a project like this on a project I’m more familiar with, would be very valuable. John: for other foundation, did an audit on a single project, which then allowed the other projects to better understand the result. So we could pick one ASWF project to start, would take a month or two. | Cary: do they just “do it themselves”, or is the project highly involved? John: for an audit, there is interview / discovery and tooling, so they don’t just go off and do in a vacuum, they want to understand the context. JC: when doing a threat model in a company, there will be someone who leads and has to be very familiar with the project, otherwise the threat model won’t be that valuable. | Alex: how would the report come back to the project? Would it be a public document with a lot of security issues in the open that might not be fixed? John: if you look at Mosquito project document, there will be a list of vulnerabilities the project needs to deal with. Starting with that in our projects may not be the right approach. In a threat model, they will produce a report that can be used in a public forum, helping to understand the threat model the project might face. So help you understand how security relates to the specific project. You get a series of actionable points to take away. Alex: improving security is important, and understanding how it works for our projects. For companies, it’s a double edged sword, when these projects become public, and companies need to act on these reports before the report is public. Cannot leave known issues unfixed. John: there would be responsible disclosure. | JC: (in chat thread) a good explanation of what a threat model is | Scott: I assume the way to put out the report is probably do up CVEs as well. Also, not sure if the Linux Foundation does this, but apparently there’s something called CNAs that can manage creating and updating CVEs (I could be completely wrong about this | JC: I wouldn’t necessarily expect CVEs to come out of threat model exercise. It can (if you happen to find some vulnerabilities, but you don’t need to create CVEs if you just fix the issues | Scott: From what I understand, groups such as Debian depend on CVEs to exist to prioritize updating a package or not. | Spencer: CVEs are typically generated by software vendors when they discover vulnerabilities in released products, security companies/experts, and - probably less so - end users. | Scott: Sounds good. I don’t know how the ASWF projects handles generating CVEs. | Larry: On the contrary, what we have seen on some of our projects is that there are a ton of people we’ve never met before who seem to be in the business/hobby of fuzzing packages and approaching them for CVEs to be filed, in order to… I dunno, claim credit for finding them? Rarely have they seemed like legit security issues and could generally have been handled with less panic by just filing an issue. | JC: CVEs are often (sadly) used as a tool, not in the positive way. It’s often used as a tool against project maintainers. | Scott: Yeah, I’ve been following the creator of cURL on Mastodon and they’ve been banging their head against people generating CVEs for non-issues. Including some reports that are generated by LLMs. | Larry: Many projects (both gcc and llvm/clang, for example) have recently produced documents that detail all the things they will no longer consider to be security issues because they’re overwhelmed by this stuff. It’s such a black mark to have an unfixed CVE, you feel like you have to fix it right away and that can overwhelm the dev capacities of many projects. | Spencer: Welcome to the world of bug bounties. A very good way to reward people for researching and finding security issues but it’s generated a whole industry of people that take it well beyond anything useful. HackerOne | . | nanoColor WG proposal (Carol) . | project proposal | working with Doug Walked, and Material X leadership | FYI at the TAC level, call for involvement if this interests you | overlap with the reasons we are starting the Color Interop forum | OCIO, OpenUSD and MaterialX working on this document, but we want collaboration with other projects, but trying to solve specific issues in the context of rendering, materials and textures, want to keep it focussed on a specific context, also want a working prototype at SIGGRAPH. | Want to avoid fragmentation as projects need to solve these problems. | Looking for input on the work more than anything else. | Eric E: what does this do that OCIO doesn’t, or vice versa? What would the core functions be? Carol: looking at small / light version of OCIO, only core concepts. Minimized dependencies, so you can run it on a piece of hardware. No support for external files like 3D LUT files for instance. Limited scope of color operations, only analytic instead of table driven. This charter is high level since we haven’t decided yet as to what the technical details would look like. But want first to make sure people are OK with this plan. | Larry: imagine where there is a zero dependency, single header implementation that would give you interop with the 12 most important color spaces supported by OCIO, that’s what I’m hoping for. Eric E: need to read the document. | Gary: OpenFX is looking for a common set of baseline color spaces right now, we’d love this. | Carol: we’ll create a WG proposal right now if that’s required, want to start right away, don’t want to put more overhead. Larry: not sure why would need to make it an official WG, we’re already collaborating with OCIO, and you already have the structure to support this. Carol: we use the name Working Groups inside of OCIO, this would be an OCIO WG with cross-project collaboration. John: that sounds fine. | . | Zero Trust Working Group Proposal (Jim Helman) . | At MovieLabs we have 2030 vision, with security as we move to the cloud | The “perimeter” is now in the cloud, Spencer developed a security architecture based on Zero Trust. Zero Trust controls being added to TPN | At last year’s SIGGRAPH we made a proof of concept, but had issues with how to pass security tokens around. | Want to document best practices for ASWF projects so they can have the required hooks to integrate in an environment where authentication / security checks are required. | Have been socializing this, Google and AWS are very interested. Autodesk, Foundry and Adobe also interested. We have a critical mass of interest. | Looking for feedback on the proposal . | Focussed on Zero Trust, not looking at CVE, CIs, dependencies… Wanted narrowly scoped / focussed on Zero Trust | As opposed to talking about a Security Working Group | Also looking for involvement | . | Have some logistical questions. MovieLabs can help organizing. How is leadership of a WG established and maintained? | When objectives of a WG are established, does it shutdown? John: can work with you to answer logistical questions. If anyone has interest, GitHub issue is listed in agenda. Also if you have interest in participating. | Larry: can you append to the issue / proposal if you have identified which projects and people within these projects you identified could be good to participate? And make sure you have buy-in from those people? | Jim: one item would be to identify which projects would most likely need to operate in a Zero Trust environment. Purely local library projects may not apply for instance. Will go through the list of projects and reach out. | . | OpenQMC: no update? . | Eric E: correct | . | Vote on OpenQMC project . | Has it stalled at the vote? Should we discuss this further in an upcoming TAC meeting? | Carol: was a bit confused by the email, but yes, seems we need to have more time to discuss, we didn’t have time to discuss it after the presentation. | John: TAC meetings are trying to get filled up, but will try to find some time. | . | OpenLensIO Proposal (James) . | Having computer issues, can you bring up slides? | Presentation Link | This is my first engagement with ASWF or any open source projects. I’m at Mo-Sys, we make camera tracking software for virtual production. Have a software engineering background. Involved with SMPTE RIS group, see a lot of positive work, and goodwill between competitors in the VP environment to try to standardize and improve the process for VP. | Virtual Production Context . | VP is an umbrella term for real-time VFX | VP requires live accurate camera tracking and les modelling | Lens modelling is more than just Focus, Iris and Zoom | Camera and lens data can be recorded for traditional VFX (especially as the quality of the data can improve): want to deliver data that can be used in VFX | . | Current State of the Art . | Render engines and VFX tools must correctly interpret many different lens models | Lens calibration is painful! | Manufacturers like Mo-Sys have built proprietary systems | In the absence of a standard, lens models are diverging | Models are complicated: multiple lens elements, anamorphic lenses, camera mounts / shims | . | Why OpenLensIO? . | Much is already published / open but with different models | Standardizing to improve interoperability | The mathematical model itself is not commercially sensitive | Encourage manufactures to publish lens files to make VP easier and more accessible and publish their distortion models. Every lens and camera needs to be calibrated on set to generate data that’s usable in AR or in post. It can be done as part of on-set prep for high end productions, but can become a real pain for productions. In cinematic environment could have 18 lenses and 3 cameras, need to calibrate every combination, could take a whole day. If more of that work can happen at the manufacturer where they know the characteristics of the lenses based on a standard, would encourage manufacturers to publish in a known format. | Seems a good place where an open source community can help, we need to bring back things to a standard. We can agree on the math, and then an OpenLensIO community can state that this is the best possible mathematical model we can agree on, the reference implementation can derive from that. | . | Goals . | Generic, practical, end-to-end mathematical model . | Nail down the math, at first for a spherical lens | End-to-end model, not just a computer vision models, but incorporate known requirements for media production (overscan for instance) | . | Training resources and documentation . | A big knowledge gap, most people who don’t work with VP day to day don’t understand the importance of lens modeling | . | Reference implementations . | Could include shader code, for instance an ST map | Reference implementations for transport of the data: data usually sent from tracking system to render engine, but how that’s done is undefined. Make it easier for producers and consumers of the data to use it. | . | Framework for an open lens library . | As lookup tables. A lens file describes describes distortion characteristics of the lens for every zoom and (?) value | Could be open sourced, would be game changing for Virtual Production | If lenses are supported by main software vendors and packages, and supported by tracking providing, we then create a resource like OCIO, encouraging manufacturers to contribute to it | . | Is it a WG on its own? Or part of OpenUSD? | . | Feedback? Next Steps? . | Carol: thank you for presenting, we recognize this is necessary work, needs to happen. Trying to figure out how to get everybody to agree. Question is whether ASWF is the right place to help achieve these goals, what we can bring to this effort. So this needs to happen, but why specifically the ASWF? We have some examples that are example libraries in DPEL, but most of our projects are software. Are you imagining a software library? | James: not just a library of lens definitions, it’s also about the software that makes it usable. Happy to be redirected somewhere else if you don’t think it fits here. Our lens library is open to our customers, I want to do this work anyway and will continue to pursue it. Is the foundation the right place to do this? How much is the software critical? I think the core is not the raw data, it’s about the software that makes the raw data usable. Transport could be one reference implementation, shaders could be another. Could also be a node in VFX compositing software, could be a plugin to Unreal. There are lots of software use cases. | Carol: how is the software helping become something that can be used by any application. Different than what other groups are trying to do. | Michael: USD is not an ASWF projects, but there are WGs, in particular the USD-Camera WG, have been looking at both virtual and practical cameras. We have people from ARRI, Cooke, VES, ASC… There have been some deliverables, so you should present to this group, there are a bunch of people not on TAC call. Also OTIO are involved in USD Camera, data that could be coming off set can be interesting in both VFX and editorial. This seems like a very important effort. James: yes, will check those out. | Nick: on behalf of USD Camera group, we would love to have you present, lenses have come up recently for discussion, great opportunity for collaboration. #wg-usd-camera | JT: USD Camera WG Wiki. We have a channel on the ASWF slack server also, #wg-usd-camera | Eric E: do you look at characterizing other aspects of the camera, colorimetry, depth of field? James: those are outside of the scope of this specific effort, but in scope of SMPTE RIS Camera Tracking group. Hopefully some of the work emerging from that will start forming standards and guidelines. But this is a specific pain point about lenses that’s separate from the cameras. | John: this is proposed as a WG, does the TAC want to move forward? Michael: makes sense to first talk to the folks who are already working on this? James: yes, this makes sense, we will figure out where this can fit, and come back to TAC if it is worth being its own entity / separate enough. | Jim Geldudick: working on whether any of the work we do in RIS could flow into ASWF groups / projects, we have similar groups between TAC and WGs, we have a camera test coming up considering outside of lens mapping. Hoping to share more going forward. Why we starting RIS was to create standards, have been working towards this in the last 3 years. Similar to what was presented for nanoOCIO earlier. | Larry: neat project, this is important work. Not sure where it should live, there are overlapping efforts happening in different places, good to shop around, not just where it should live, but also how to deal with overlapping efforts. Even if it ends up incubating somewhere else, once you have a software infrastructure, that could be hosted in ASWF. You need to figure out what’s the best place for this to have its infancy, you may have more shared interested in groups that are already looking at some of these issues. But it is important work and needs to work somewhere. | Nick: highly complementary to USD Camera work, would love to further discuss this with you. | John: will keep this on the agenda and reach back | James: you can reach me via email at james@mo-sys.com | Jim Geduldick (chat): 3 camera shoot with up to 12 lenses per body takes us quite a while to calibrate across spherical and anamorphic. That could just be for 1st unit. And getting X number of samples per sense with (OpenCV) model is very time consuming. | Scott (chat): For some reason, this sounds like a project and not a WG. Especially if the goal is creating some API to handle the camera data. | Nick (chat): We treat a somewhat end-to-end camera model focussing on various aspects such as lens metadata, characterizing various components of a camera, and mappings to interactive cameras. | Jim Helman (chat): Links to some of the RIS OSVP camera stuff: RIS OSVP Metadata RIS-OSVP Metadata Toolkit | JT (chat): In high end live event media production(my main industry) we also use this at the camera/lens end, calibration and projection management software middleware to the projector lens output end, which is closely related to in, it’s just the other direction. This tech is very narrow and specific in live event high tech, and very hardware specific. | Jim Geduldick (chat): Agreed it’s the same tools across VP for film and tv that flows into live XR and AR / Simulcam. | Carol (chat): I wonder where the ASC sits on this too | Michael (chat): Some folks from ASC show up at the USD Camera WG | Jim Geduldick (chat): You can also reach out to me Jim@spaceboylabs.com for more questions on SMPTE RIS | . | . | .

John to provide paper trail | Scott (chat): GitHub Issues is good enough for me. | . | No updated on OpenQMC | No update on Open Source Track at FMX . | David: we will reach out to some of you, one spot left for a presentation, has to be someone who is already in Europe, if you know someone who is part of our ecosystem who could present on an open source topic, please send their name to David and Emily | . | Security Threat model analysis for ASWF projects #615 . | Some comments added to the ticket | John: Don’t know if some projects have discussed it internally? . | No updates | Please discuss at project level | Nick: for the 90% coverage, does that apply to OTIO the library, or OTIO the library + utilities + …? John: it’s a great question that leads into next topic… | John: the way the requirement is written, wording calls for “90% statement coverage”. So a FLOSS tool has to exist. Also does the project have the required hardware to do the testing. For demo code, that may be outside the goal, the focus is the core code. Nick: could we annotate this? Would like to forestall arguments in TSCs and avoid hair splitting. John: yes we can work to upstream with OpenSFF badge definition and for now annotate our own. Larry: for OIIO we do include the utilities, anything the user considers a deliverable, but exclude the viewer since there’s no practical way to do it for now. Nick: that seems like the model to follow. Eric: if we can come up with some sort of language, what Larry said is reasonable, but want project guidance. Don’t want to incentivize projects to not offer useful tools to avoid bringing down coverage number. Kimball: in OpenEXR, we make sure example code compiles, but don’t necessarily have deep tests, which seems reasonable. John: most projects may be able to get to 80% coverage, 90% seems more difficult. Larry: passing is 70, silver is 80, gold is 90%. Projects are struggling to hit 80%, and 90% is unrealistic without sucking up too many development resources. Cary: OpenEXR is at 82%, seems pushing it further would be diminishing return. | . | John: We would omit some requirements until we have better language on how to achieve them. | Reproducible build: a lot of projects don’t distribute binaries | GitHub Pages and ReadTheDocs don’t put out headers to satisfy this requirement, but this is really meant for non-static sites. | This is where we’ve landed, are there concerns to “box these out”? Larry: I’m still skeptical about “higher than passing” requirements as part of the adoption process at all. Cary: the ones listed here are the ones OpenEXR hasn’t achieved. I’m on board with security threat model audit, concern will be a fair bit of effort to be told what we likely already know, but would be good to be told we haven’t missed something obvious, so I’m up for that. I don’t see any of these requirements that OpenEXR is going to find valuable / worth our time. So I would vote in favor of deprecating these requirements. Alex: is this above OpenSFF? Isn’t OpenEXR already at 100%? John: this is for Gold level, OpenEXR is not at Gold yet. Carol: there are 2 important things here that we are toying with: security is important, in different ways for different projects in foundation. OpenEXR has gone furthest, but one reason is that this is a project where security really matters and can have big consequences. Would like to heard from projects where the time put into this may not be as necessary, do removing these requirements help getting projects to Adopted stage, since that’s the main goal. We’ve heard from projects that are close, we haven’t heard from projects that are not close. Eric: from OTIO perspective, one of the challenges is that our core team has declined a bit, where we have time to spend our attention, we are at critical inflection point of major vendors who want to adopt us but are asking for some critical features. So “which checkboxes” are more important to hit? I’m probably going to be more focussed on features requested by vendors. We would love to graduate to Adopted phase, but will be hard to find the time to do this. Also Jonathan brought up MaterialX statement coverage, since can’t run GPU code in CI. Creating a minimum bar for coverage may create an incentive not to turn on certain CI tests that would lower your coverage. Jonathan: these are all good goals, but reaching Silver/Gold should be separate from reaching Accepted status. | John: thought were were closer to consensus, so we’ll need to circle back on this. Carol: don’t think we’re super far to updating the badge requirements, we should still do this. There are two separate things: adjusting the requirements, and tying Silver/Gold status to project Accepted status. David: we’ve talked about this a lot, can you explain if it is possible to separate the Silver / Gold from the Graduation of the project. John: the TAC can do what it wants, it aligns with what other communities have done. If the idea is that the TAC views these requirements as not necessary to move through the lifecycle. But seeing other industries that were in similar positions, they are more and more looking at these kinds of “gauges” to review the software they are using. Everyone is starting to require ways to gauge the quality of the software we use and produce. But if the TAC decides it’s not a tool it wants to use… Larry: no one is saying that this isn’t a tool we want to use, but advancing from from Incubating to Graduated (Adopted) shouldn’t be tied on Silver / Gold. The list of exclusions is likely good, but it should be an “extra mark of quality”. If foundational packages in our industry are listed as “Incubating”, that’s a problem. John: the TAC is welcome to do what it feels is appropriate for its lifecycle requirements. David: what needs to happen for the TAC to make this decision, is it a vote? John: yes, that would be a vote to change lifecycle requirements. David: can the TAC work on the wording of this proposal to separate the Silver / Gold requirements from the Graduating process and vote on that at the next TAC meeting? Larry: we’ve already graduated projects that didn’t meet those projects / made exceptions. Carol: yes, we can draft language and put it in a PR. John: please put a PR together. David: let’s do it | From Chat: . | Eric: OTIO is at 80% | Larry: I think OIIO is in the upper 7x% and every 0.1% extra is a lot of additional work. I am still working to get to 80% but I would have a hard time justifying going higher given the amount of work it took to get from 75 to 80. | Jonathan: MaterialX currently has 88% statement coverage in unit tests, but we’re intentionally omitting all of our GPU-based rendering libraries, as we don’t yet have a way of running their unit tests on GitHub Actions. Our progress towards a Silver Badge is stuck at 96%, with the last two requirements both being related to security. | John: I think the gaps from MaterialX are about the same as OpenEXR from my review | Nick: A concern I have is that if acceptance is gated on achieving these goals, it is a disencentive to overly invest in a project. Hey finance! We’d like to invest more in this project we want to donate to ASWF! Great, have they accepted the project? No, it’s gated on us spending hundreds more hours of work Umm, can you check with them, that can’t be right? | Larry: I think these are all good goals but reaching silver and gold should be entirely orthogonal to the transition from “incubating” to “acceptance”. It should be an additional merit badge or whatever. | Carol: Yeah. I mean I guess we really need to hear from LF why it’s not an option? Because it sounds like maybe its a problem? | Nick: The projects all feel like they are in a kind of limbo ~~ aswf logo-clouds all our projects, yet so many are not “accepted”. Very awkward ~ much prefer the “achievement” aspect, rather than “limbo” aspect. | Eric: I also want to reiterate - security is very important to me, especially in interchange formats where the files me make and read might be flowing across airgaps and aren’t likely to be able to be scanned for being maliciously malformed. | JT Nelson: As a contractor for the industry in the IT, security and dataservices channels, my focus and people like me are on MPAA security best practices compliance by content creator 3rd party studios. Just FYI https://www.motionpictures.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sup_english.pdf | Larry: To close out the last topic, I want to reiterate that none of John’s work shepherding the OpenSSF requirements is wasted. We absolutely should keep going on this and try over time to have project meet as many of the requirements as possible AND have some kind of designation for projects that meet this high standard. My only grumpiness is that it shouldn’t be a requirement for incubation -&gt; adoption. | . | . | Working Group for Rust Bindings #489 . | Scott Wilson | Presentation Slides | Where We Were by Last Presentation . | Progress Ground to a halt | Group focus at the time was misaligned . | We tried to build C and Rust bindings to help see the Rust bindings | Focus on getting babble (formally cppmm) developed instead of using what was already available | . | . | What’s Changed? . | Changed priority to use binding generators that already exist (cpp, cxx, etc) | Changed meeting time from every second week to once a month | . | OpenIMageIO Bindings . | Reasons to build bindings . | Relatively easy API to build bindings for | A useful library to have in the Rust ecosystem | I personally really like the library | . | Development in 3 stages . | Unsafe “sys” bindings (slightly over half way complete) [https://github.com/vfx-rs/oiio-bind/issues/29] | Safe “API” bindings | Migration over to the openIMageIO project and crates.io release | . | Goal is to have the bindings ready for testing by end of summer | . | PTex Bindings . | Added wrapper for the PTex writer APIs . | Supports writing halfs, floats and ints | . | Switched over to the cxx binding generator | Added wrapper for the reader APIs . | Supports reading floats and face info adjacency data | . | Build system updated to better support pkg-config variables | Future plans are to continue on with the reader APIs and plan for a version 1.0 release | . | USD Bindings . | Progress has slowed down due to developer time and size of project | . | Babble . | Went through another rewrite to get a pybind style binding generator | Refocus on generating a C API then later Rust bindings from the C API | . | Questions? . | Larry: how do you decide to use cxx vs Babble? Pros and cons? Is it a way to get both C and Rust bindings? Scott: with cxx there’s still a lot of hand writing to do, you have to implement each function by hand, tell the binding generator how everything works. With Babble a lot of this can be automatically generated, with some caveats requiring human intervention. There’s also something called autocxx which I haven’t tried and can do something similar. cxx at a 1.0 release, already exists, being used, other packages depend on it. Babble can do some really cool things, but not ready for use yet. Will we want to replace everything we’ve done with Babble, or stick with cxx remains TBD. | . | John: we will vote on renewal offline due to lack of quorum. | . | New Project Proposal - Pillow #631 . | Jeffrey Clark “Alex”, forked from PIL | Will explain how Pillow is aligned with ASWF | In 2019 TideLift Lifter paid for work | Lifter Advocate in 2023/2024 | TideLift is like a ‘RedHat for everything but the kernel” | Working to learn on VFX + open source | Lifter Advocacy | Get a job in Industry | Pillow + ASWF . | Benefits to working together | We could use some help, for instance the CLA (Pillow currently has none) | Infrastructure, community: transitioning from Travis to GHA | Ran into Dev Days from October 2023, which got me interested, contributed to OpenImageIO wheels packaging. Got a lot of help from JC and Larry, not finished yet, but hoping to finish it. | Seems at ASWF still has a lot of “stuff” to be done. | . | Specific Alignments . | 1.5M repositories / 15k packages on GitHub depend on Pillow | . | Infrastructure . | JC helped to clarify what ASWF does for its projects, CLA seems most meaningful to Pillow. Larry clarified that dev resources are not provided. | Give and take? | Keep up with Python releases | Publish wheels for all ASWF projects | We have a security contributor who deals with CVEs | . | Make Pillow and VFX better together . | #1888 in Pillow issue tracker: support for higher bitdepth | . | Thank you for the time to present! | John: questions? . | Michael: I’ve used Pillow before, can you give a brief overview of what Pillow covers? Alex: a low level image processing library for Python. Michael: are there operators like a “histogram”? Alex: all matters from basic operators, resizing, blurring, changing image type, the proposal has the right description. We carried over the PIL documentation, lots of great tutorials and examples of how to use. Also quite common in data science, some overlap there. | Carol: thanks for the presentation! Everybody appreciates the importance and prevalence of Pillow, I’m not sure that “alignment” works here. We may alignment philosophically, but it can also meant the project ecosystem and applications. Would be interested if there are examples of using it in VFX, and if not, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. We could be collaborators, but moving a project into ASWF may not be the best fit? There’s a lot of things that Pillow does that OIIO already does and has Python bindings for. There may be other places which are a best fit? We have a focus / scope… Alex: yes, I agree with that. Carol: that’s just my opinion of course, and would love to see more. Also if you have directions you are planning to take the project that would relate to VFX? Alex: since I don’t work in VFX, that could be difficult. The opportunity to jump into a working group like this is rare, for instance I don’t have a way to reach out to data science industry. Scott (chat): I agree with Carol. The VFX use case is probably a subset of what Pillow is/can be used for. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s another group within the Linux Foundation that would be an excellent home, but we’re happy to have you hear no matter what! | . | John: thank you, we will further discuss the proposal at next TAC meeting | . | .

Emily: no, not yet, send me a note if you are interested | John: earliest we’ve had the date locked down! | Ken: are we doing cross promotion for projects outside of ASWF? We have some papers related to OpenVDB, so if we can promote them, that would help? David: yes, we do, if we know about these papers, we are glad to promote the “brotherhood of open source”, let Emily know | . | FMX . | Emily: that’s situated, we have talks around ORI, JF, David. Let us know if you are planning to be there. On the Wednesday of FMX, 3 presentations, part of trying to grow our presence in Europe, a lot will be doing on around that. If you know someone going to FMX, send them our way. | . | Volunteer for SLP (Carol) . | “Insert guilt trip here” | Coming up very quickly, we’ve done a great job getting applications and web site up and running, earlier than we ever have. | We’ve moved up timelines around SLP to give us more breathing room. We have over 130 valid learner applications, have already done some filtering. Program is focused on people from under represented people in the technical side of the industry. | Looking for volunteers at various levels of commitment in hours | Even if you can’t contribute over the summer, there’s one category coming soon (in the next week or so) is that we need people to review applications. We do a double blind review process, remove identifying information. Each application is reviewed by 2 or 3 people, with 100+ applications, we need people to review applications. | Application may seem long, but you can skip sections for positions you aren’t interested in. | SLP Volunteer Application Form | As TAC members, please all sign up to review applications, and share the blurb in the agenda item with your company and social channels. | A great way to get new people involved in our community! | . | Start definition of TAC chairperson roles - John . | Everyone on the TAC encouraged to review the item, reviews greatly appreciated | Want to start getting this operational before too long | . | Implications of xz hack - Larry . | Does everyone know what it is? | Blog Post on OpenSSF site | 3 year social engineering effort | Kimball: leveraging peer pressure | John: we could spin off a separate group to bring TAC recommendations | Larry: special call out to Cary Philips who has been way ahead of the curve staying on top of these issues for OpenEXR | Larry: we often talk about engineering resources on projects, “there’s lots of projects out in the world where only 1 or 2 people are doing the work, maybe it’s not so bad”. When there’s a discrepancy between the goals of the project and available resources, that can make it tempting to accept any contributions without giving them the proper scrutiny. So incentive to get projects properly staffed. Also we have programs to get new people involved, but we need to think carefully about how much effort we put into recruiting new people we don’t know / don’t have industry connections vs putting more effort into people already in the “circle of trust” and who may better correspond to the people who have the required expertise for our projects. I am not turning down outside help, but we need to think about the pros and cons. | John: would it make sense to have a group that digs into this to bring recommendations to the TAC? | Kimball: the Security WG which has been quiet for a while should get involved, whether we need to modify the OpenSFF badging requirements. Perhaps also ask the D&amp;I committee for input. Bullying was used to get the initial patches into the xz project, so how do we make sure that doesn’t happen. Spencer: the oss-fuzzing project was convinced to turn off some tests that would have found the backdoor. Is the combination of social engineering and manipulation of test tools that resulted in going undetected. | John: we currently don’t have a Security WG, had felt WG CI might be the place to discuss this? Larry: CI WG is poorly attended by projects. JC: would be happy if there was a separate group of people who wanted to look at it, I wrote some thoughts on this. It’s important to figure out as a group how we can protected ourselves against this. If someone wants to participate, that would be great. John: I can help you get this going if you want. | Cary: OpenEXR chipping away at OpenSFF requirements, dependabot, had been questioning whether this was worth it, but with the xz incident, it makes it clear it was worth it. Our projects are resource starved, and we do get some random contributions with small fixes. Natural inclination is to bend over backward to accept contributions, but something that looks innocuous may not be. | Kimball: that’s why we have the PR review process | Cary: there’s nothing I’ve done on OpenEXR that can’t be deployed to other projects, nothing is complicated. I’m going to report back at next OpenEXR TAC, and could be deployed to other project. | Is there something happening at the LF level? John: there’s the blog post on OpenSFF web site. There is a Community Day at next week’s SOSS conference where a “desktop simulation” of a supply chain attack will be run. Can follow some of the guidance from there. | Phil: every project will be looking at these techniques, and already doing most of them, but may not be enough to protect ourselves. Every open source project has the same challenges. | John: a lot of great tooling and documentation within OpenSSF, leveraged by OpenEXR. Let’s get a playbook for the other projects based on what Cary did for OpenEXR. | Cary: a lot of the work is boiler plate | John: will work with JC to get a separate group going | Thoughts from JC on xz hack implications | JC (Chat): There is no security-wg right? . | John: Not presently - I think it somewhat part of the CI WG | Scott: There is a slack channel, but I think the group was having troubles with trying to figure out what the scope of the group is. | JC: That’s because we don’t… Last time we talked about it, it was decided that wg-ci would take the security stuff. | Kimball: There’s a slack channel, maybe I was overzealous in calling it a WG | Ben Giles: Threat analysis would be good as a start. I have done this in the past for … actors that have the ability to create or use cover. We’re not there, but there would be commercial/IP equivalent prior art. Reminds me of Ken Thompson’s C compiler backdoor for login | Kimball: I like the idea of this WG as we need to balance performance with security, and need to understand the implications to large fields of bespoke pipeline scripts… 🙂 | . | . | Zero Trust Working Group - Jim Helman / Daryll Stauss . | ASWF Zero Trust WG Slide Deck | Background and Purpose . | Legacy solutions relied on perimeter security for media creation: secure the facility with firewalls and have artists work entirely inside the perimeter with minimal additional security checks | the complexity of productions has increased and attacks have evolved, the perimeter security model has become less effective. Zero Trust solutions, which add end to end security between the user and the service, improve both the efficiency and security of the production. | This working group will develop standards and best practices for implementing zero trust solutions in media production applications | Proposal | . | Today’s production infrastructure: datacenter and hybrid cloud . | See diagram on page 3 | . | Production in the cloud . | See diagram on page 4 | The cloud is a global production resource outside of facilities’ infrastructures | The application is moved to the data. Workflows run in the cloud | Everything happens outside of facility security perimeters | . | The Problem . | Multiple facilities, data centers, cloud computing, and SaaS applications make defining perimeters difficult | Passing data between vendors on the production makes perimeters porous | BYOD, work from home, and working on location increase efficiency but are all challenges to perimeter security | VPNs require security management, lower performance, and provide little to no granularity of access | Applications and plugins increasingly rely on network services making defining and managing the perimeter more difficult | Automation and software-defined workflows improve efficiency but also increase the API connections across infrastructures and organizations | . | The Solution: Zero Trust (ZT) . | In ZT nothing is trusted without first being authenticated | ZT authenticates a user, and perhaps a machine, rather than just trusting everything inside a perimeter | In ZT, authentication is mutual. The service authenticates the user/client. The client authenticates the server. | Client applications and plug-ins using network services need to incorporate ZT, acquiring and transmitting authentication tokens, and authenticating the server (eg via its HTTPS certificate) | Network services incorporate ZT by authenticating the user/client and checking that the user is authorized to do the activity | . | Sharing authentication data between media applications, with a single sign on, reduces friction for the artist | . | Standardization Benefits . | Make implementing ZT solution easier | Avoid duplication of efforts for software ASWF projects | Increase security by having trusted implementations and recommended policies | Lower the impact on artists by reducing the number of separate authentication requests from applications | There may be future projects that involve code / libraries. But also things can be done around best practices, OS-level key stores. | . | Engagement . | Participation . | MovieLabs, Daryll Strauss, Chris Vienneau, Spencer Stephens, Matt Daw | Amazon, Blake Franzen | Google, Toby Scales | Foundry, Dan Hutchinson | Autodesk, Claude Robillard | Adobe, TBD | . | Relevant ASWF Projects . | Used with plug-ins accessing network services: OpenAssetIO | Client/Server systems: OpenCue (cf issues 218, 344, 425) | For currently non-core use cases: OpenReview (already patched w/one approach), OpenImageIO (if I/O proxy used to access network resources) | Potential projects waiting in the wings: Google OpenProductionDataIO | . | . | TAC #621 has proposed charter | JF: would a manifest of resource access be in scope? Daryll: I don’t know of a standard to document this stuff. Spencer: that’s the problem with pulling the security to the perimeter. ZT simplifies the problem, that reduces complexity and increases security. Jim: we are working with TPN for a draft of Zero Trust controls, will be out before the end of the year. | Eric: Would it be in scope to advocate with DCC vendors to adopt some of this? From a project perspective, we just look at paths on disk, we don’t handle a lot of authorization. Jim: that’s why we’ve been talking with Adobe and Autodesk, as long as DCC uses plugins to allow data to come in, there needs to be a common way to do this. Having every plugin pop up an HTML widget to request (redundant) authentication is not a good user experience. JF: “SSO within an application”? Gordon: ideally want SSO within a session, if you want the full benefit of Zero Trust, there’s going to be a lot we need to solve. For the WG, did we consider one of the goals to come back with a proposal to the TAC for a code project? Jim: yes, that’s a goal. Gordon: would it be a common library, what should be the role of our open source projects be. Maybe a recommendation rather than a proposal, multi-phase recommendation. How should the ASWF think about ZT, what does it mean? Or does it affect the DCCs, would love to see that. | Jim: second deliverable talks about next steps, and whether a library is needed, or can just use existing OS infrastructure (key stores) | Daryll: likely leads to building libraries to avoid redundancy | Spencer: also what existing libraries we could already use. Want to leverage libraries developed by security-conscious developers. Code we produce would leverage existing libraries. | Jim: WG typically don’t generate code, it’s more of an incubation / sandbox project. This is why we scoped it this way. | Eric: to me ZT lies on how studios implement their pipelines, they have to understand what their roles are. At Netflix we have an OAuth framework for this. Why is this best housed at the ASWF rather than within a WG at MovieLabs for instance? Jim: that’s another possibility, we thought it would be good in ASWF since focussed in good software practices, and relevant to a number of the projects. Also you already have most of the major DCCs participating, and a more public venue than some of MovieLabs projects. | Eric: we have people representing all the parties, and a good framework for collaboration. | Cary: will echo what Eric was saying, most of our projects are “computation engines”, from an OpenEXR perspective, we don’t “do most of that”, for instance I don’t have to worry about authentication. Same for MaterialX for instance. Most of our projects don’t deal with those issues, but the DCC vendors who rely on our infrastructure. Obviously this is a good initiative that should be supported, maybe ASWF is the right forum. Don’t think we strictly prescribe the types of projects we take on. But a lot of project maintainers here may think it doesn’t really affect their project. | Jim: it may be that some of the file manipulation projects may need to become network savvy, same as how ffmpeg can take URLs. You can mount a bucket locally, but that may not be the best solution. | Larry: asking to Cary, do you imagine that it’s that far a stretch for an application using OpenEXR might want to call open() passing a URL rather than a filename on disk? | Cary: if we got a PR adding that kind of functionality a couple of years ago, we would perhaps have accepted it. But we realize “we don’t know what we don’t know”, and we aren’t steeped in security issues. Guiding us in that direction is a good thing. | Toby: the idea of doing it here rather than studio side, you have a lot more power and influence over the devices, but here was want to focus on decentralized ZT, how do we take all the security benefits of the ZT model and spread it to all the solutions here. Spelling out that this is the preferred way going forward for projects under ASWF looking to take on the benefits of ZT models. | Spencer: the way infrastructure is being used is changing, we’re moving towards decentralized infrastructure. | John: sounds like we have a lot of interest, not sure we have quorum? Should we take this offline and discuss at next TAC meeting? | Cary: I think at WG is a good idea, if a year in we decide | Wave: presenting a motion, Carol seconds | No oppose / abstain: vote passes | Gordon: we should have a 3 month check in, not just wait a year, since it’s new for us. And maybe TAC can provide feedback, would like to see touch points. | John: good idea, we’ll adjust the schedule. | Larry: should have asked this before the vote, but who from the projects should be on the WG / participating, or will someone from the projects will show up and do some of the work. Wave: will show up initially, I’m interested. Jim: we have Foundry / OpenAssetIO, so we have some participation. Gordon: we also have Autodesk in here. Larry: I have people in SPE who may want to participate and will connect with the WG. | Eric: would love it if something would work with 2030 Greenlight stuff. Jim: that’s a great idea, we are doing PoCs and working with partners, great place to prototype something. Eric: would love to be able to collaborate with 2030 Greenlight initiative. | John: will follow up with onboarding | . | Chat: . | Spencer: MovieLabs has produced a video on zero trust and production security | Ben: Is it more about authorization than authentication? Security metadata (ACLs) on artifacts being necessary but not sufficient for ZT? | Spencer: Both. Whether ACLs are sufficient is a matter for risk assessment, using ACLs is one way ZT AuthZ can be implemented | Ben: Sure— I suppose I was highlighting that it’s necessary to have ACLs on the data itself so that authorization is possible? Then the authentication can be useful in being the go/no go? | Deke Kincaid: Seems relevant to openrv &amp; xstudio | Carol: To me, seems like a good use a of a working group for initial discovery. Even if, as Cary states, there might not be much initial application to projects directly, it might impact us eventually. | Eric R: USD referencing could get interesting in this world, what if your references point to assets sitting at various sub-vendors working on a shot? | Michael: It’s expected that a studio would implement their own Asset Resolver in USD, and many do, and those usually involve authentication… | John: A working group could generate code ( for example, Working Group for RUST bindings does - though that WG is designed around upstreaming into other projects so it somewhat makes sense ). | . | .

    "content": ". | SLP 2024 - Carol . | Deadline for reviewing applications has passed, we’re looking for mentors, guest mentors (fill in for vacation) and well as people for the Speaker Series. | . | TAC Chairperson Role - John . | Some comments in chat. Any concerns until we move forward? | A number of people +! it. | Carol: there’s probably more to flesh out in terms of what happens if the vice chair has to exit, do we hold a second election, does the vice chair have to serve a full year before they can become chair… So need more details. | John: if there are no concerns, we’ll merge this and start working on an execution plan. | . | Pillow / Swift WG Proposal . | Do we want to block off some time? | Larry: can we just do this now? John: is there more discussion? or are we just saying not for now? | Carol: there are two different “stories”. For Pillow, if they can go off and come back with use cases in VFX? Larry: it doesn’t read EXR files… Kimball: should it merge with OIIO? Carol: it may not be worth ASWF time, we already have / use OIIO, so not a useful use of resources. John: any concerns with this as the feedback? Kimball: fine by me. John: will provide the feedback, we can always onboard them to Linux Foundation as unfunded projects. | Swift WG: Carol haven’t read updates on discussion, would want to see who this would benefit, a couple of projects / companies to “sponsor” this WG and statement of participation. John: can provide feedback as well. | Larry: these are 2 cases where project proposals came from outside our community (not member companies or projects, no one stepped forward to champion), given how tight the TAC schedule is, I am concerned about load of multiple project proposals. Should there be a bit of a “barrier”, come in with sponsorship of a project or member company with a commitment to participate. Don’t want people to just use ASWF as a stamp of approval for a project which may not be all that relevant. John: should we have a TAC vote to put on agenda? Larry: needing a TAC sponsor would be a good first step. David: TAC or member sponsor. Larry: TAC has representatives from all members? David: only premier members, not general members. John: I can put some wording on the lifecycle document. Larry: we don’t need to be too particular about who the sponsor is, but we want to make sure that project proposals are relevant first. John: will put something together for TAC review. | Nick (chat): Did Rust WG get similar sponsorship? I’m not spotting how Rust &amp; Swift differ here. Both have advocates in member companies, but neither is a bottom line investment for any member company, that I know of. Kimball: Was a different time, but a member org / representative did sponsor / propose that… Carol: Who are the advocates for swift? Apple? Anyone else? Nick: I mean beyond Apple, I don’t think Pixar is unique is using Swift in production. Carol: Cool, this is the info we’re looking for! Eric: I also wonder if Disney feature animation might have interest? Nick: Anyone doing work with Apple’s headset is using Swift. To your question Eric, it’s public record that Disney is working on a number of headset based projects. Scott: Yeah, when the Rust WG was approved, we had someone at Amazon be our sponsor, but I think he’s since left Amazon/the ASWF. Nick: So I’m just drawing a line between headset work and Swift as being interesting to ASWF member companies. Apple headsets of course, I acknowledge the existence of Meta. Dhruv: Might be a stretch, but quite a few of the member companies use apple products like Mac’s , phones etc and provide apps for them. Larry: The proposers of Rust WG were associated with member companies, and at least as importantly, were people known to us with a track record of getting things done useful to production. Dhruv: So as much of a rust fanboy as I am, I think swift is more applicable. Carol: Yeah this is useful. I am definitely not saying no to the swift wg, just asking for them to get a list of their proponents and who would be involved in making it a success before we vote to approve it. Larry: If somebody from Apple wants to be a major champion and participant in the WG, that totally changes the picture. Is it “we like if people use Swift”, or “we will be enthusiastic participants in the WG with our time and resources?”. Dhruv: I’ll discuss with Wave. Time is the hardest one since we are actively contributing to so many projects already. Perhaps we can revisit after WWDC24 because we get a pressure relief after that. Michael: I asked Tyler to try and get some other folks in the ASWF community to step forward to help drive it and show interest, but I haven’t heard anything on that. I’m happy to contribute if there is interest, but I haven’t seen it yet. I hope that changes this year, but we’ll have to wait and see. | . | XZ Security Follow Up - John . | One thing I forgot to mention - we will be holding a follow up meeting on the xz vulnerability and actions for ASWF projects on Monday at 12noon PT - register at Zoom call | . | OpenEXR Annual Review - Cary . | 2024 OpenEXR TAC Project Update | “Glass Half Full”: admire the caustics in the image | OpenEXR Project Mission . | The goal of the OpenEXR project is to keep the EXR format reliable and modern and to maintain its place as the preferred image format for entertainment content creation. | … | . | Steering Committee | OpenEXR/Imath Releases . | Last TAC Update end of 2022 | . | Commits . | Way more of the work happened before ASWF, but removing pre-history, downwards trend in volume, but picked up in 2023 | . | Commits: TSC Members . | Haven’t formally identified roles within the project | Kimball is the architect, drives the advance of the project, everyone else as the “sous chefs”.

There was a weird situation where it has fallen into disrepair, had been done by someone outside the project. This is much better. Pillow is very accessible on PyPI, so that’s often what people start with. Having OpenEXR available on PyPI is great. | Cary: this is always below our radar, the problem was that it was out there and people were using it. Our party line was “if you want Python bindings, use OpenImageIO”. But that exhibits a mindset of working at a large studio with a large engineering staff, building behind the firewall with large infrastructure. But for a lot of people, if you can’t pip install, it doesn’t exist. We’ve come to that rather late, but it’s a philosophy we need to embrace. PyPI setup for OpenImageIO may be complete yet (?), at least there’s a start on it. For revamped Python bindings, I see something very basic / barebones, nothing tricky, but will be useful, and it’s what people will get when they do the natural thing of “pip install openexr” | . | Project Weaknesses / Needs . | Windows support | Hardware-we-don’t-have support | Widening the contributor community . | Some contributions on Dev Days, hasn’t panned out into longer term support, except one developer at ILM | . | Transition planning | . | OpenEXR voted unanimously to be continued for one more year | Jonathan (Chat): Great presentation, Cary, and we’d love to learn more about the OpenEXR team’s approach to fuzz testing. Chris: Great presentation Cary. Do you have a specific list of needs on the windows side? LarrY: Another OpenEXR roadmap item I don’t think was mentioned is GPU decompression and/or direct loading. NVIDIA and Epic have both discussed lending a hand there as well. Cary: Mostly just random support issues, “X fails on Windows”, often CMake related. Chris: cmake issues are definitely a pain to track down … there’s so much variability in how it can be used. | . | Rez Annual Review - Stephen . | 2024 rez annual project review | Project Info . | Brief Description: a lightweight cross-platform package manager written in Python.

Would be good if TAC or TAC adjacent members who know someone using rez, please let them know we want to talk to them. | . | Motion to renew? John . | Kimball makes motion, Larry seconds | All yeah, no oppose / abstain | Rez is renewed for a year | John: we’re trying to get better about doing these motions | Stephen: if we can keep up this momentum, we may push for adoption in the coming year before next review | . | . | Dev Days 2024 - Carol . | We have dates, Sept 25-26, locked in, helps people plan in advance. | We’re looking for general “intent to participate” from projects - there will be a more formal process soon, but if you could reply here, or let myself or Larry know if your project/company wants to participate this year, would be amazing! | If your project or company has a “pretty good idea” you would like to participate, we would like to know so we can start working on website, press releases. Let me and Larry know. Larry: every project that participated was enthusiastic, encourage other projects to participate. | Jonathan (chat): count MaterialX in | Kimball: my company will participate, and OpenEXR as well | Larry (chat): SPI is in, and so is OpenImageIO. Want to say yes for OSL, but not sure we can come up with one day tasks | Carol: we’ll have a more formal participation process, will be coming next. | Cary: a few obstacles last year, but wasn’t that hard. ILM is in again | . | . | Open Source Days 2024 - Emily . | Call for speakers is open, please submit . | Use cases, best practices | If you have heard someone give an interesting talk or heard an interesting topic, reach out to me | Also looking for program committee to review CFP submissions, a 2 hour commitment. Would like to have a few more folks to contribute from TAC to make sure we have relevant content. | . | Ben Giles (chat): I had some fairly positive responses internally on my attending SIGGRAPH or related to discuss our 10-bit colour Wayland compositor and my trials and tribulations. I love that people here may be interested! Are there other events or people I should be highlighting? Happy to discuss offline as well. 4:4:4 chroma subsampling also related… Emily: You should submit to speak at ASWF Open Source Days during SIGGRAPH. Ben: Thanks Emily, will do. It’s been very encouraged getting positive feedback from ASWF folks. ASWF community ROCKS! We have access to some artists and TDs that can help with a demo. Is there anything in particular people would like to see working in our compositor? Whether that’s a particular ASWF project, pipeline, or tool? I’ll note we currently use Blender and a lot of open source kit because Wayland is not part of the VFX Ref Platform. Would love to get more tools onto Wayland like Houdini, Maya, Resolve, Nuke, etc… John Mertic (Linux Foundation) I’d love to chat about getting Wayland into VFX Ref Platform (I think we spoke about Workstation Experience WG or similar?). Carol: Working with OpenReviewInitiative comes to mind. We’d love to come, if we (startup vendor), are welcome. We work with OSS projects, particularly around Wayland and the graphics stack generally. | . | . ",

Several TAC members will be at Digipro | . | Implications of xz Backdoor #652 . | JC: thanks for everyone that joined, we are going to work on the items in issue #652 | John: will turn these into “programs” for the projects | Kimball: it’s not a per project problem anymore, but we will pull binary assets from DPEL, or should this be another project? Have we thought about someone embedding something malicious in DPEL? John: not sure we got to this level of detail. Kimball: OpenEXR is relying on pulling test images, could be an attack vector. Larry: it’s hard to imagine that going away, but may be different from blobs getting incorporated into software builds? Kimball: XZ attack unpacked malicious payload from test data. We can have policies for individual projects, but thinking about the cross project policies. John: a worthwhile next discussion. Larry: OIIO has a lot of images in its own test suite, they are binary, but also some images are from regression test suite from fuzz tests, so they are malicious by design. Kimball: we should have a follow up conversation. John: yes, there are actionable items we need to work on. | . | Dev Days 2024 Participation #662 . | Finalized project participation form, can be shared later today. | Carol: we will share soon, will put out the form, deadline is going to be around mid June. You will have to submit the form by mid June so we can have everything ready to announce at SIGGRAPH. | . | Operationalizing the TAC Roles plan #665 | Clarify policy on incorporating Zoom chat to TAC meeting notes #667 | ReadtheDocs Inventory #672 | . | OpenImageIO Review #509 . | OpenImageIO TAC Review Slides | Larry / Daniel: Not just the TAC annual Review, but also our 1yr Anniversary | Mission . | OpenImageIO is a toolset for reading, writing, and manipulating image files of any image format relevant to VFX / animation via a format-agnostic API with a feature set, scalability and robustness needed for feature film production | . | Major Components . | CLI tools | Python bindings: ImageBufAlgo, ImageBuf | Image format plugins | . | Ecosystem role . | Founded by Larry Gritz in 2008k joined ASWF in 2023 | TSC: SPI, Weta, Blender, ARRI, Disney TV, Animal Logic, Autodesk, Laika | Dependency of ASWF+ OSL, OCIO, MaterialX, OpenUSD | Depends on OpenEXR, OpenColorIO, OpenVDB | Embedded in: Maya, Houdini, Katana, Blender, Arnold, 3Delight, Gaffer… | Used in approximately all studio pipelines… | . | First ASWF year highlights . | 334 git commits, 41 contributors, 29 of which are first time contributors | Licensing change to Apache-2.0: 99.86% LOC, 93% of files | OpenImageIO 2.5 release . | Improved color management, especially with OCIO 2.2 | oiiotool –parallel-frames | TextureSystem color management | Hundreds of fixes and enhancements | . | Dev Days: 8 contributions | OpenSSF: 100% passing, 87% silver, 65% gold | . | Eric: how did you get so many first time contributors? Larry: we were shocked by the stats, looked at the logs, seems to be right. We get a lot of diverse contributions. Daniel: it “snuck up” as we were putting the stats together. | Roadmap: 3.0 release this fall . | New mins: C++17. gcc9, python 3.7, OpenEXR 3.1, more | Deprecate a lot of old cruft (3.0 == can break compat) | Got rid of boost! | Self-build many dependencies if missing . | We have a wide range of dependencies to wrangle, downstream builds can be tricky, especially on Windows. | . | Rust bindings, Python wheel (we hope?) . | Python wheel: Another simple way to get a “one line” install | Rust bindings: almost all the way there | . | New file formats: JXL, RED . | From new contributors | . | Hundreds of other improvements from the past year . | Many back ported to existing releases | . | . | Readmap: Long-term goals . | Color management improvements . | Collab with OCIO + color interop forum | . | Metadata strategy cleanup | GPU: . | CUDA / OptiX implementation of TextureSystem | Direct read of images into GPU mem (collab with OpenEXR?) | . | Get our security act together . | Leverage work from OpenEXR | . | Overdue overhauls of: RAW, Movie files, HEIC | . | What’s working? . | Used as extensively as ever, growing | Essential part of the VFX software ecosystem . | Hard to find a DCC or studio pipeline that doesn’t use it | . | New features still being added / improved | TSC / meetings / extra eyes and hands | . | Engineering Contributions . | Lots of “drive-by” contributions (OIIO has &gt; 200 contributors) | Very few people with sustained, dedicated time | What percentage of “fully resourced” are we? . | 30-50% maybe? | There are features people are waiting for we can’t get to | . | . | Specific shortfalls (all part-time, 10-20% FTE) . | Ongoing part-time . | Support, issue investigation, dependency wrangling, CI, security, releasing (ongoing) | Windows | . | Short term more work, then less ongoing: . | Metadata strategy cleanup | Color management | DSLR raw overhaul | . | Several months of big work, then less ongoing? . | GPU stuff | . | . | Parting wish: Mackerel! . | “Secret” catch phrase for when an issue comes up which doesn’t need to be addressed by Larry (“teach someone to fish” analogy) | Not asking for entire FTEs | If 5-6 big companies who use OIIO extensively… . | Each had just 1 person dedicate consistent 20% time to OIIO… | Mostly doing things their own company will use (plus a little maintenance)… | . | That would probably double or triple the development velocity of OpenImageIO | . | Open Discussion . | JF: did joining ASWF meet expectations? Larry: “a solid B”. TSC really helps, more people answering questions, contributing things that would have waited for me before. More eyeballs and reviews helps as well. Only place we fall short is that I end up still doing a lot of heavy lifting, as well as some small things. Too many commits still from me, but sometimes it’s just 1 line commits, day to day maintenance. Would be good to have more people contributed consistently. We are doing surprisingly well, but wish we had a few more people with dedicated time from their organizations. Overall a big net positive. Larry: my specific fear was that we would join ASWF and I would still carry full load + extra meeting and overhead, and would end up a net drain. That was not the case, and was a net positive. Happy it’s in ASWF, helps stabilize its future. But there’s a sober assessment that I’m still doing the lion’s share of the work on my own time. | Chat: Joe Bryant: O3DE also sees surprise contributions from the larger chip manufacturers in APAC. Ben Giles: Not a Rust person— does the work for creating bindings there help for creating FFI bindings generally (LuaJIT for a random example? Scott: I can answer that (I’m building the Rust bindings for OIIO). Short answer is no, because we’re using a binding generator called CXX, which does the C++ -&gt; C -&gt; Rust dance behind the scenes. However, Anders has been working on a C++ to C tool that is in an interesting spot, but probably not production ready yet. Ben: Awesome, thanks Scott, that was far more appropriate than the LLM’s response. I may hit you up on Slack if that’s cool. No hurry in responding! Scott: Yeah, go for it! Feel free to ask any questions you have, and I’ll answer as soon as I can. Ben: As the FFI I do is typically Lua (or variants) and Python, I now understand why Rust is different. My question around the validity of Swift WG was “why not make it easy to FFI with any language” which is basically providing FFI friendly (C) headers. But I now see I I may have been naive. Scott: Yeah, C++ to C is not very trivial. If you want to do automatic binding generation, then that’s really, really hard. Anders has gone through maybe 3-4 attempts at his tool before he got to where he’s at. Tyler: I can answer on Swift related stuff — The way that Swift interop works is automatic generation of the Swift (object oriented) code of the existing C++ codebase. But it never enters “pure-C” land if that makes sense. Going the other way; the headers automatically generated from Swift can be included in C++ but not “pure-C” as well. Ben: That’s very helpful, thank you. I believe mojolang is the same. I take back my questioning of whether a broader effort is better— we have Lua clients, so perhaps I was being selfish. I prefer naive. I wonder what SWIG would say? It would be paragraph after paragraph in Esperanto flavoured English Tyler: I can reach out on slack and show you some of the generated Swift code and/or generated C++ headers if you’re interesting in seeing how some of the resulting product looks. Ben: We have the weight to push clients using Lua (and variants) to Swift on Linux if makes for better ergonomics on all sides. | Chat: Joe: So being a part of ASWF has helped organization, but possible not with contributions? Larry: There are definitely contributions. But I think a project like this has two different classes of contributions: (1) tactical: individual fixes or even features that scratch their own itch but then don’t necessarily come back until they or their org has another specific itch, and (2) strategic: sustained time that allows long term engineering improvements. I think we are currently very healthy on the tactical side, and I have no doubt that this improved as we jointed the ASWF. But the strategic contributions are still harder to come by. Joe: Thanks, I am still new to being an ED for O3DE, and absorbing how some of the larger open source projects and foundations are run, their challenges, etc. I have found that foundation/academy members tend to provide the more strategic contributors, and the general public tends to provide the more tactical contributors. Ben: I’m sure OIIO is used in science, medicine, and engineering. I used GDAL in a previous life and am happy to have moved on… I hope it’s easy to keep your focus while accommodating contributions from STEM more generally. In my experience (say, 10-bit colour in Wayland, or shader writing for the compositor)… tech artists, TDs, researchers, industry are all able to work together. We use a lot of ASWF projects even though we support more than M&amp;E. ASWF products tend to be at the upper end of capability, so it “just works” elsewhere. USD is proof of that! | . | Motion to renew . | Kimball proposes, Carol seconds | Renewed for another year! | . | . | USD Working Group Review #518 . | Alexander / Nick | USD WG TAC Review Slides | USD WG is not a project, we’re a community WG for USD. While we discuss lots of technical details, this is a place for ASWF to come around topics related to USD. Showcase work done, highlight proposals that come up on USD proposals repository, educate on topics around USD, and have 5 sub WGs that dig into technical details. | 1060+ members on Slack | 11 Active Chairs running main WG + 5 sub WGs, thank you! | 90+ meetings a year across all groups | 35 presentations in main USDWG in the past 12 months, many published on Wiki: recordings can be watched | 14 whitepapers | 1 bake-off: over Xmas / New Years baked USD cakes | 245 assets in assets WG, plus 60-70 additional files that document behaviors | 1 dancing potato | Work Products Showcase 2023 . | The Assets effort has become a valuable and often referenced library . | Shadeball is in USD format, chess game, fully fledged detailed assets | . | Port GLTF tests to USD | The Camera group has fledged a formal proposal . | Schema to represent physical camera in USD | . | Neutral platform to bring together other bodies; the work in camera brought together VES, ASC, ASWF and SMPTE in a joint forum . | Various issues around metadata | . | . | Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD) . | ASWF and AOUSD are complementary . | ASWF represents a talented and focused constituency | AOUSD is the place where that knowledge is formalized and integrated into the larger USD ecosystem | . | ASWF-AOUSD liaison agreement in place fosters that collaboration | The first concrete collaboration is the ASWF MaterialX + AOUSD Materials WG | More to come, stay tuned | . | USD-WG Tightening Scope . | We are discovering the clear value adds of our efforts | Neutral platform to bridge communities | A place for the ASWF community to share triumphs | Practical reference for best practices | Continuous exploration of automation, quality control, expectations of consistency | Pushing boundaries of what can be done . | To generate proposals and consensus on direction | . | Less focus on broadening scope and more focus on bringing value to scoped areas we’ve adopted | Specification of MaterialX in USD has shifted to AOUSD | Detailed implementation on deployment to the web is shifting to other forums such as GitHub PRs against the OpenUSD repo by the involved vendors. A consistent WebAssembly build of USD that can run in browser.

So we have options if we fill up. | . | Swift WG . | Scott: can’t comment on the Swift side, but was talking with Furby, we’re thinking of turning these into a single WG which is more than just Swift and Rust, but also C bindings, Python bindings, what can we do to share all the information we have, and continue to build bindings for different languages. Will have a meeting to discuss what this WG should look like, whether it should be a WG or project. | John: lots of +1s in chat | Larry (chat): A combined binding group can also do the deep thinking about which language bindings are worth doing and why. Scott: That’s likely going to be one of the goals. The idea is if we decide that there should be support for language XYZ, then that’ll turn into a sub-working group. But, we’ll have to figure out some set of rules to say “there’s enough interest to add this to the list of bindings we support. | Gary (chat): OpenFX may get some Rust bindings at some point, so we’d love to be in the loop on this. Great idea. | . | LFX Calendars . | Overall calendar for all ASWF meetings, also a specific per project calendar. Can also set up a vanity subdomain for calendars if you want. | Can get zoom info. If your group records a meeting, you can access the recording by clicking on a past meeting in the calendar. | Alexander: can everyone see the recording? John: depends how you set up your recording, can restrict to just your meetings. Alexander: can we get rid of the old calendars? John: yes, we would retire the old calendar. If projects want a transition period that’s OK, or we can turn if off ASAP. Kimball: can we forward / redirect? John: not really, built into the groups.io service. We are working on iCal export, coming shortly. Carol: that would would be the main blocker to retire the old one. Useful to have visibility into all meetings. John: will ask team as to when iCal export will be available, and we’ll turn off old calendars then. Erik: make sure the calendar updates correctly, people have subscriptions to old calendars that don’t update. John: challenge is more calendar clients. Google Calendar only refreshes external iCal calendars every 24h, macOS clients does it quicker. That can be a challenge. Erik: our issues were around time changes. John: LFX side has done work to fix those issues, so should be better. | John: will be able to color code projects as well in the calendar. | John: in Project Center can access URL for calendar will forward to it. Also link from ASWF main site | Larry: is there any reason to not create the vanity URLs for every project? Seems like a good default. John: happy to do this. Larry / Carol: yes, go for it. | John: will set up calendar redirects for everyone, and will get update as to when iCal export is available. | Larry: goes along with docs RTD subdomains, having a few “canonical” URLs helps to make things discoverable. Of course redirection from old link is important. But everyone should want to have https://docs.myproject.org | John: some projects will want to clean up links first | Larry (chat): calendar.aswf.io is great, I won’t forget that or have to hunt for it. | . | GPU support on CI runners : OpenVDB / Ken . | FeatureVDB coming into OpenVDB | CI needs GPU | When can we have it? We can use internal machines | JF: GPU builders available available through AWS CodeBuild (OCIO) or new for-pay GitHub Builders. Post in #wg-ci and we can make this work. | . | nanobind : Ken . | Ken: a Python binding library we’ve started using at NVIDIA, has better support for GPUs | Matthew Cong: | VDB Python Bindings : pybind11 to nanobind | GPU Accelerated Python Bindings for NanoVDB . | NanovVDB enables GPU support for the VDB data structure | Want to enable Python programmers to use GPU-accelerated NanoVDB functionality | Example applications for GPU acceleration: . | Volume queries and sampling | Interconversion between sparse and dense representations | Mesh to SDF, points to VDB etc | . | Implement bindings with nanobind’s built-in CPU/GPU array exchange support . | pointsToGrid(ndarray&lt;float, shape&lt;any, 3&gt;,device::cuda&gt; tensor) | . | Allows VDB to be used seamlessly with PyTorch, TensorFlow and other GPU-accelerated frameworks | . | Example video of MonkeyMesh moving through sphere with collision detection, all done on GPU. | A modern and efficient Python binding library akin to Boost.Python and pybind11 | Developed by Wenzel Jakob, same person who created pybind11 . | Faster compile time, smaller binaries (26.3% reduction in the case of OpenVDB), and lower runtime… | . | Implications for OpenVDB . | OpenVDB Python bindings are currently implemented using pybind11 | Want to support nanoToOpenVDB and openToNanoVDB conversion in Python | In order for the underlying C++ object to be portable across two sets of bindings, they need to be built with the same binding library . | Usual requirements of Python and C++ ABI compatibility for object exchange across dynamic library boundaries also apply | . | Need to also port the OpenVDBPython bindings from Pybind11 to NanoBind | Small risk to break external Python bindings, but we think this risk is small | . | Proposed Course of Action . | Move ahead with the port of Python bindings from Pybind11 to NanoBind . | Introduces a minimal optional dependency on nanobind for OpenVDB | . | Small risk of breaking external Python bindings that translate OpenVDB types at the C++ level . | Python API for OpenVDB remains identical | Change from Boost.Python to pybind11 for OpenVDB was recent and there have been no issues reported | . | Python support for Open to NanoVDB conversion enables workflow acceleration | Improved array exchange support makes the ecosystem more modular and improves the reach of VDB for ML frameworks | OpenVDB and NanoVDB become trailblazers for GPU accelerated Python-based workflows | . | Larry: why is VFX Platform 2022 the earliest version that can be supported? Some projects need to support 2021. Matthew: 2022 upgrades from Python 3.7 to 3.9, and nanobind supports Python 3.8 minimum. Larry: interesting constraint, I know a lot of studios are still on Python 3.7. Other question: pybind11 makes it possible for one project to use the other project’s types in its public API. Would this cause issues with nanobind with interconnected projects? Should all our projects switch? Matthew: it’s more fragile than that, if you have different versions of Pybind11, bindings might not interact. So not sure that just being in the pybind11 ecosystem makes you safe from that if you have different pybind11 versions. Ran into such an issue yesterday, one version of pybind11 aliasing another version. It’s a fragile thing to start with, passing C++ objects between DSOs. | Kimball: say OpenEXR sticks with pybind11, but want to make a tool that accesses VDBs, what are the implications. Are there automatic conversions between data types so arrays can pass through? Matthew: nanobind generalizes on top of pybind11 which uses the “python buffer protocol”, nanobind uses “dlpack support”, like the “python buffer protocol” extended to support GPU devices. It’s an open source spec, is being / has been adopted as the next generation buffer protocol for Python. Think of it like “numpy extended to the GPU device”. Kimball: if one project switches to nanobind, all of us will have to switch? Matthew: discussion on implications of matching bindings to different C++ types. Kimball: VDB internalized imath types in the past, will you need to create your own version of imath objects if imath doesn’t switch to nanobind? Matthew: there are imath vector types and OpenVDB vector types, could do on the fly conversions using Python type casters. Gordon: does this bring in libraries that would cause issues in more constrained scenarios? Matthew: no hardware dependencies, nanobind is lightweight, always built as a static library which emulates the header-only functionality of pybind11. | Ken: no red flags? Larry: the opposite, thanks for the presentation, may cause other projects to think about what comes next after pybind11, especially when Python 3.7 requirement goes away. | Ken: apparently another ASWF project had considered it? Matthew: it was USD (not ASWF). Matthew: yes, discussed in USD WG. | Eric R: In this context where they’re describing dropped features, what do they mean by embedding: “Multi-intepreter, Embedding: The ability to embed Python in an executable or run several independent Python interpreters in the same process is unsupported. Nanobind caters to bindings only. Multi-interpreter support would require TLS lookups for nanobind data structures, which is undesirable.” Trying to figure out implications of embedding, a lot of apps embed Python interpreters, wasn’t sure if the term “embedding” means what I think it means in this context. Would be a blocker if we can’t use bindings from embeded Python interpreter. Matthew: like embedded Python interpreter in Maya? Larry: you can also use pybind11 to embed the interpreter in your app, when I first heard of nanobind I though that wasn’t there? JC: pybind11 embedding This is what pybind11 documents, nanobind doesn’t support this and likely won’t support it. It means that nanobind doesn’t provide an easy to embed an interpreter, but you can still use the CPython API to achieve the same goal. | John: will follow up with Matthew and Ken if there are more questions. | Ken: we promised the TSC we would bring this up and see if there are any loud objections, doesn’t sound like there are any | Gordon (chat): would be around dependencies: does this change introduce new library or hardware dependencies that might make it harder to use this in more constrained applications? | Eric R (chat): In this context where they’re describing dropped features, what do they mean by embedding: “Multi-intepreter, Embedding: The ability to embed Python in an executable or run several independent Python interpreters in the same process is unsupported. Nanobind caters to bindings only. Multi-interpreter support would require TLS lookups for nanobind data structures, which is undesirable.” | Matthew (chat): FWIW, I think Pixar plans to move OpenUSD from Boost::Python to PyBind11, and intentionally not NanoBind b/c it gives up some critical features like custom holders and binding classes w/ multiple inheritance. | Alexander (chat): USDWG boost::python -&gt; pybind11 | JC (chat): This is what’s not available in nanobind | . | Dev Days 2024 . | Carol: project application form is live, should be easy for projects to fill out. Also link to Dev Days Wiki | Worked to consolidate info from last year’s Dev Days that were spread between projects. So before you apply, read the project guidelines. We’re also looking on feedback, put together based on last year’s Dev Days. Lists expectations as to what you need to do before (go through Good First Issues, use CLOtributor, choosing a Dev Days Lead, creating a project specific landing page). We want you to think about these requirements before signing up your project for Dev Days. Think about how you want participants to communicate with you during Dev Days so we don’t have to go back and forth as much. We’re going to give projects about a month to look through this and decide if they want to participate. Mid June deadline, may push a bit. We know that July is busy for SIGGRAPH, and August is vacation, and event is in September, so we want to be ahead of the game. Open to feedback / schedule. Next big date will be participant registration at Open Source Days. Keep adding Good First Issues, don’t expect project to have 100% readiness when submitting form, but want at least some of the prep work done. | John: participant registration will be live before Open Source Days (say 15 July), but big push / launch at Open Source Days | Link to OCIO to show what a project specific page can look like. OCIO has this on your Wiki, you can have yours wherever you like (Wiki, GitHub) | Larry: on CLOtributor there are “magic” words to use in project Issues that are critical. You need to follow CLOtributor’s nomenclature when rating issue difficulty in order for it to get picked up. CLOtributor Don’t always love the choices it made, but it’s fine. Carol: we’re requiring the use of labels “good first issue” and “help wanted”. Larry: in CLOtributor docs, they mention something like “mentor available” which is a neat idea. John: that’s a good one, will add to the docs. Carol: want to make sure we don’t create too much work. | Carol: Sept 25-26, or maybe 26-27? We’ll get the typos fixed! | . | Operationalizing the TAC Roles plan . | Approved at previous TAC meeting | We can get this going . | Want to elect a vice chair, do we want to get this started now? | Rotation: rotate at end of the year, or push out later? | . | Objections against starting nominations for vice chair? We probably need all the time we can get. Larry: vice chair to Kimball? John: yes. Also for timing when would this run? | John: we’ll open the call for vice chair, get a few people interested, discuss at next meeting | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Dev Days . | Registration form is out there (TODO: add link). | Larry: repeat of last year, info on the page. Projects are requested to put their wiki page together as per requirements. | Carol: please register, deadline is June 15th so you wouldn’t have to worry during SIGGRAPH. Registration is easy, can update issues after that. Take a stab at your project page and good first issues and continue to refine. Tell us you want to participate. Larry: deadline is for project to say they will participate and mentor participants, biggest thing is to have a bunch of issues for people to work on, appropriate 1 day tasks, tag them accordingly | . | Open Source Days . | Emily: schedule is posted on web site, registration is open | Talked to most projects about virtual town halls and bofs, schedule being finalized, talk to me if you haven’t talked to me yet | Working on Beers of a Feather, currently scheduled for Sunday night a “Flight Club”. But it’s also Papers Fast Forward, so considering moving to Monday Night so people don’t have to choose, trying to see if there’s a conflict on Monday night. | Carol: keep it on Sundays, it’s right after the event, but we had same conflict last week. There will be conflicts on Monday which we don’t know about. | David: any other reactions? Show of hands for conflict with Papers Fast Forward | Matthew Low (chat): Electronic Theater is Monday (and Wednesday) evening | Ken: when are timeslots assigned? Emily: there is a spreadsheet with that info, have OpenVDB on 3PM. Let me know if there is a conflict and I can rearrange. | . | Operation of TAC Roles (John) . | Asked about TAC vice chair, have someone come forward, Larry. Willing to be vice chair for rest of year. We can make this official. | Larry: only a temporary reprieve! We want someone else to step in at the end of the year. | Kimball: move to vote. Seconds. Vote, unanimous. | Larry: based on Digipro model, 2 person rotating on 2 years. So there’s always one existing and one new person per year. Gives you a finite period of time where you have to do extra duty and there’s someone to help you. Will make sure to get someone else to do this next year. | JT (Chat): Yup, this rotation model w/one old and one new, is a popular model in many circles, even with 3 people in the rotation, then you skip one or more after you are out and then are eligable again. I’ll see if I can get a written/link reference for this, but it’s quite a popular governance model in some circles. | . | Engineering Contribution Assessment (Larry) . | David asked me to think about metrics we could us to measure the mandate for contributions, get more out of the engineering contributions. | Put together a spreadsheet after pitching to the governing board, got positive response / feedback. Will send invites to spreadsheet | A panel for members that involves self reporting. Figure out which projects are important to your organization, which projects are you putting resources into. You can read explanations in spreadsheet. Looking at which projects are being contributed to at which level. Also looking a contribution friction. | Collaboration between governing board and TAC rep | Meant to be a source of “introspection” in your organization. Maybe you think you are putting in your FTE, but if you can’t say where, you may not. | How long does it take to send in contributions, want to spark internal conversation. | Not about “name and shame”, but we hope it helps give a view into who is struggling and who has found good processes. | Similar panel for project leadership, which organizations do you think are contributing resources, will be interesting to see if these answers match up with member companies and identify disconnects | Also ask to estimate how fully resourced a project is. If you imagine there’s an engineering resource level that would allow all goals to be met, what would that be. | John to send spreadsheet invite to project leaders and company representatives. If you have questions, feel free to ask on Slack or DM me (Larry). If you feel there’s something relevant that people should know about a project or company, please add it as a note to the spreadsheet. In the spirit of the dependency spreadsheet, try to get on a single page where everybody is. | Want to discuss this at next Governing Board strategy meeting in a month so would like to have feedback by then, but this is a living document that can be updated over time. | . | CI WG Review (JF) . | CI Working Group TAC Review Slides | Ken: will there be slides? JF: yes | Ken: what about CUDA version? JF to check. JF: what do you need? Ken: nothing older than 11.6, but would prefer 12. TODO | Ken: default runners are now twice as big as before, since we first asked for additional hardware, should we re-evaluate? JF: yes, best to use free runners if possible. | Daniel Heckenberg (chat): CUDA Compatibility. V535 should be able to run CUDA 12x | Larry (chat): I would encourage all projects that build things and depend on the infrastructure to at least occasionally send a representative to the WG. It really is a small group and quite often questions come up about project needs and we don’t have good project representation on hand to answer. | Doug (chat): It’s unfortunate that the meeting is scheduled against the USD WG. Larry: Neither group had their schedules handed down on stone tablets. Things can be moved. Carol: It might be worth trying to figure a way to call things out for projects when those items come up, even as a back-up for when project representation can’t be there. Where we can’t always be at meetings, we can do better at async communication. Happy to try and create a path for that. Larry: CI WG only meeds 1/month, we can even designate a subset of those (1/quarter?) as instances designated for wider participation sought, so busy people don’t need to come every time. | John: can we do a vote? . | Kimbal: propose to extend CI WG. Eric: I’ll second. Carried, WG renewed | . | . | OpenCue Review (Diego) . | OpenCue TAC Review Slides | Diego Tavares, TSC Chair | TSC: . | Brian Cipriano | Benjamin Diners (Imageworks) | Imageworks | AWS | . | Agenda . | OpenCue History | . | History . | OpenCue is an open source render system | developed by Imageworks from 20 years ago | Used throughout pipeline since 2003 when cue3 was developed (predecessor) | Open Source 2019, joined ASWF | Graduated to adopted on 2021 | 2023: Matt Chambers won Sci-Tech award | By proxy OpenCue was awarded | . | Review . | TSC chair handoff - brian is still part of the project | Preliminary version of CueWeb (web version of the GUI) presented to the TSC | Several UI improvements and bugfixes | Blender plugin, almost ready to be merged and released | Performance improvements on the database schema, made system more stable and faster | New feature for Out-of-memory prevention, important for system management | Update python dependencies (Pyside 6), allows running on Apple Silicon | . | Goals . | Upgrade Cuebot (server module) to Java 21 | Review communication channels | AWS Open Job Description protocol (OpenJd-Deadline) . | hopefully can reuse a job description between different render managers | . | Enhance Windows support . | More companies enhanced on running OpenCue on Windows, already works, but not fully featured. Make it fully featured on Windows, especially features that heavily depend on POSIX filesystem | . | CueWeb release . | Both web and Qt based UIs (for in-DCC integration) | . | . | Challenges . | Big number of stale PRs and Issues . | Actions . | Use TSC meeting to discuss pending issues and PRs at least 5 items per meeting | . | . | Project homepage (opencue.io) is rarely updated . | Actions . | TSC meeting agenda on Blog page | Blog post cards on the homepage | Show project activity / show that it is under development, and allow people to catch up on latest news without having to look at PRs and Issues on the GitHub repo | . | . | . | Larry: often a chance for project to ask the TAC if there are things that other members of the community can do to help. Diego: could use help on how to create good communication channels, how they are using Slack, how they are maintaining their community. Want to make sure that communication channels are open, how they can reach us and where do we talk. | Carol: on the question about the website, a lot of our websites are a landing page on how to get to other stuff. Instead of adding meeting notes to web site, you might just update links to make it easier for people to get to those resources. Could link to Wiki for instance (easiest for meeting notes), make your Slack channel more prominent. Diego: didn’t know we had a Confluence, that’s a good place to have our meeting agenda. Larry: a lot of projects post the TSC agenda to the Slack ahead of the meeting, and summary after the meeting. So makes it possible to quickly keep up on top level discussions without having to go into the details. Carol: vast majority of projects are now Slack centric and have picked that as main communication method. OCIO treats mailing list for release announcements, or announce an event, but that’s about it. | JF: motion to renew. Larry: seconds. Unanimous, renewed. | . | . ",

Overhead of registering is minimal, OCIO has a good wiki page. We have a few months to do rest of prep | . | Clarify policy on incorporating Zoom chat to TAC meeting notes #667 | Engineering Contribution Matrix . | Project leads: please update | . | PyPI account: please add aswf-pypi user to your project, same as ReadTheDocs. Will put link on Slack channel | Zoom polling for TAC votes: #702 . | John: PCC has a voting feature, but it would be offline voting, we’ve done this from time to time, maybe TAC wants to go that way. Otherwise it’s the consensus voting. | JF: no support in Zoom polling to designate who has voting rights | . | Zoom comments: OK to include? #667 . | Kimball: seems OK, especially if editorialized | Stephen (Chat): Sometimes it’s nice to be able to add a comment to the conversation for consideration, but not require the spotlight to do so, especially as speaking into a room of 25+ people, it can be tricky to get a word in edgewise. | . | . | OpenFX Annual Review - Gary #514 . | OpenFX Annual Review Slide Deck | First full year as ASWF member, overall things have been quite good, seeing benefits of being ASWF member. | Still challenges | Moving to a 1.5 release for SIGGRAPH, our last 1.4 release was 10 years ago, so we’re definitely making stronger progress | Organization Status . | Stats . | Contributors . | 8-10 people attend every TSC, sometimes we get 10-12 | Only 3 GitHub committers &amp; 4-6 GitHub reviewers - need more! | . | GitHub users: up 2x since last year | GitHub visitors: up 2x since last year | Git stats . | Commits up 87% | Contributors down 6% | Forks up 60%, starts up 15% (380 vs 321) | . | Monthly TSC meetings are solid, reliable, helpful and well attended | Mailing list: 50+ members | Slack: 148 members (this is our primary communication channel now) . | Up from 98 in June 2023 | . | Discord: 50 members | . | Updates . | New website is live | 1.5 is coming by SIGGRAPH 2024: color, OpenGl, GPU, new properties | . | . | Organization Status: Discussion . | We are starting to move much faster than we did pre-ASWF. Monthly meetings help a lot, and the ASWF’s resources really help offload the admin work, as well as helping set direction and give us goals to reach for | But we’d like to go even faster if we can | We will always be slower than some open source projects because we have major commercial users, and because OpenFX is a mature plugin standard, so we need to get buy-in from both hosts and plugins before committing a change to the standard. But we can do better around release engineering and support libs | We’re trying to pull people together and get consensus on how to extend OpenFX both into new areas and deeper into existing use cases, to ensure OpenFX is the standard for visual effects for many years | Color management (headline feature for 1.5) is a great case study: being part of ASWF has enabled us to work more closely with OCIO to define how effects and host apps should communication color information. We hope to do the same thing with OTIO to help transport effect definitions in timelines in a portable way. | . | Project Status . | Tech . | Gpu support for Metal, OpenCL in addition to CUDA: complete (98%) . | Vulkan support is on the list | . | Overlay drawing support for non-OpenGL hosts: complete | Conan &amp; Auto CI builds | In process . | Automated release process | Color Management: use OCIO | Improved spatial clip management | . | . | Outreach . | Working with other ASWF groups: OTIO, OpenCOlorIO, CI working group . | OTIO: helping define effects definition schema | OCIO: using that to specify clip color spaces in OpenFX | CI: helping set up CI and Conan | . | Non-ASWF groups: ASC and SMPTE re: “frame decision lists” . | Open standard for recording framing decisions, analogous to EDLs but for spatial framing (cropping, pan&amp;scan etc) | . | . | . | Outlook . | Focus Areas . | Adding color management - our top priority right now | Adding plugin and host example and test code for all new features | Solid CI and release process | Helping everyone migrate away from OpenGL (GPU buffers and DrawSuite) | Support Vulkan image buffers, as demand grows | Supporting OTIO’s effect definition standard | . | Needs . | More contributors / committers / reviewers | More input from new people | More git and github expertise amount the TSC | Help to support our example plugins, and plugin and host support libs | Better documentation of host feature support | . | Ideas . | Would folks be interested in ASWF open source events at NAB or IBC? . | Since we’re in the 2D post space, most of our users and contributors are more likely to attend NAB than SIGGRAPH | David: want to move this forward, let’s set up a meeting with Emily to figure out what to do at NAB next year. Start thinking about what that could be. Gary: I have plenty of good ideas. NAB is now actively promoting open source, had dedicated space in South Hall | David: are you aware of Dev Days? Do you intend to participate? Gary: haven’t been able to get someone in TSC to volunteer to do the ground work. David: would be interested in hearing if Dev Days would fit, or not. If not, what would be the mechanism? We have evidence from last year that it works, but may not be for all the projects. How can we help you to get more engagement, we can take this offline. | . | Could we create a job board to match projects with developers? | . | . | Questions? . | Larry: curious about lack of familiarity with Git / GitHub? Are you drawing from a different population, less familiar with open source processes? Usually we see this with people new to working on a project with other developers. There are resources we could point you to, tutorials, perhaps where other projects could help? Gary: I do have a collection of these resources I draw upon and send to people. Everyone on the TSC is on GitHub, but we are drawing from a “traditionally closed source” population, people who grew up with CVS and Subversion, and have made Git work like that, in a centralized way in their organization. So trying to drag them into the 21st century! It’s working, getting more PR from group members. Larry: we have some of those issues on other projects as well. Gary: also more a question a time, having people submit PRs instead of sending patches via email. People on TSC see the benefits of the CI process provided by GitHub. So we’re getting there. | Eric: we’ve talked about OTIO in the past, all sorts of overlap between projects. At the TAC level, have we talked about some kind of “cross project summit” so we can hammer out issues at the ecosystem level? How do we create a nice hand off between projects. How can the ASWF facilitate that, a meeting of the minds for a day. Gary: we had a subcommittee working on color, there were some TAC level decisions that forked off nanocolor group, how do we define a well known set of colorspaces that everyone can use. So that process has worked out well. Eric: maybe it makes sense to keep things things more topic focussed? But OpenFX schema definition has overlap with OTIO, have been working with ACES Metadata File (AMF), places where that overlaps with a lot of the domains with work in. Not sure what’s the best way to create cross project alignment. Gary: maybe that is the right way, we identify the needs, and then get people together to do it. This group (TAC) isn’t going to figure out the right set of color spaces. Larry: but this group is the right place to indicate that this topic exists, you have everyone’s ear! Now you can take it off to a separate group. Eric: haven’t been paying close attention to color interop forum due to personal interests, but how do we communicate what the color pipeline is so we can repro in various pieces of software. Maybe I should have been paying more attention there? | . | Larry (chat): Dev Days can be (it is hoped) one way to attract new people. It’s also a forcing function for the project to get its contributor docs and process into decent shape. | Stephen (chat): A “Cross-Project Request Board” sounds like a great way to get dev talent to cross-pollinate on projects outside of Dev Days. ASWF bounty board? JC (chat): Like Clotributor? What would be different? Doug: We have an initiative called the ASWF Color Interop Forum that is working on cross-project color topics. Stephen: I think of it as different sides of an awareness coin. Sure, I can go seek out specific issues if I know what I’m looking to go solve for someone, but I don’t know what a project really needs that isn’t accurately decomposed into GitHub issues, and many issues don’t decompose that neatly. Not knowing that a project needs help with a conan issue, I’m not likely to go looking for conan issues, or know what project has posted up such an issue. Eric: Maybe related, if OTIO binds Imath and OpenEXR binds Imath, how do we make sure I can pass v2f from one to the other? | Eric: Ffmpeg only takes PRs through mailing lists | We don’t have quorum (11 of 23) for a vote to renew, will do offline | . | New Working Group Proposal - ASWF Language Interop WG Tyler / Scott #704 . | Language Interop WG Slide Deck | Languages: dedicated to providing C++ interop, and between various programming languages, each as a sub working group . | C | Python | Rust | Swift | . | Other languages to be identified by the TAC / TSC… | Goals . | Collaboration with the ASWF in the mission to allow all of its existing projects and libraries to interop with these other programming languages, following eah respective language’s best practices and standard | Through the availability of plugins and other tooling… | . | Non-goals . | Existing C++ libraries should not be modified, or modified very little | Not rewriting existing C++ libraries into these other languages | . | Responsibilities . | ASWF language interop WG . | Organize sub projects / WGs and make sure we’re all on the same page with general design decision, communication etc | Decide if a language is going to be included as an interop target (project will likely start with C, Python and Rust, with Swift being the first language that will likely be accepted as well depending on how we decide to set the bar…) | . | . | Deliverables . | OpenEXR, OIIO, Ptex and USD for Rust | OpenTimelineIO for Swift | USD for Swift | Subsequent products to be identified by TAC / TSC | . | Questions? . | JF: is language specific in scope? Tyle / Scott: I think it is, for instance if a project has figured out how to do it with CI, we want to spread it to other languages. Since every project uses Python, the sub WG for Python can share that knowledge. Similarly with Rust. | Kimball: OpenEXR is heading towards ABI stability, make it so our library is more reliable so you don’t have to recompile every year. Have you had thoughts around ABI compatibility? Tyler: speaking generally? Swift is not currently ABI stable on Linux, it is on Mac, they are working towards ABI stability on Linux, but not there yet. Swift generates its own Swift code looking at C++ headers, works for most code. There are extensions one might want to provide, and require manual effort for a “safe” API, Swift is different in this case, whereas for Rust you would write the C wrapper. Rust might be the more stable / fuller API. Kimball: you can use SWIG to generate bindings, not sure it’s a great solution, but if you run against new version of OpenEXR, could generate different bindings, so how to make sure the bindings are stable. Tyler: versioning the bindings to the respective versions of the library, may be able to use multiple versions of the bindings. Definitely doable in Swift, the API is creates can be based on a namespaced version of a C++ API. There should be a lot of focus on that, preserving the previous versions of a library, consistent with the versions of a binding. | Eric E: there’s sometimes a tension between making the API isomorphic to C++, and making it idiomatic to the target language. Rust wants memory safe, Python wants object oriented… Tyler: it should relate to the API be targeted, and shouldn’t be a playground for language specific tools. Oriented towards the use case of the library, before going too far into the feature of a language, let’s get the vanilla features of the bindings work. Rust can get more intricate with memory management, but we should be able to provide the standard, base API. Scott: the goal is that it should “feel familar” in the language, with some exceptions like error handling, where C++ can do it in many different ways, whereas Rust does it in a single way. Eric E: is the audience someone who knows the library and wants to learn a new language, or already know the language and want to learn a new library. Scott: both could be satisfied, Rust uses traits for object oriented inheritance. Would need to be figured out. | Michael: I really like the framing of this WG, this is a challenge that ASWF has had since the beginning, people who have a passion for specific languages, picking a couple of languages, do it as a single effort, and allow people from different languages to collaborate. These languages all tend to have a package manager that people agree on (Rust, Python, Swift), so part and parcel of the bindings is a policy for the package manager. To Eric’s point: I will offer the example of USD, if you look at the SDF API (one of the lower level libraries in USD), it’s a very Pythonic API, but made the USD Python API a one to one mapping to C++ API, so there are examples to study. The Swift bindings for OTIO are rather idiomatic for Swift. | Larry: there was a comment in non-goals, don’t want to introduce a bunch of heavy PRs in the projects without having to change the projects. I think it’s a good non-goal, but don’t be shy about making suggestions to the projects. If you find yourself thinking that a design decision in a project makes some bindings hard, don’t hesitate to communicate this. Putting Rust bindings on these libraries is a good goal, and there are Rust concepts that make C++ safer, so could improve life for C++ folks as well. So that kind of feedback is good, don’t be shy to make it. Tyler: for Swift it requires built in Clang attributes, to see difference between a mutable reference vs a shared reference. Would these attributes be acceptable? | John: we are at time, we can continue offline. Meeting at next TAC meeting. Kimball: yes bring it up at next one. | Kimball: is it a WG or a project? | Eric (Chat): Maybe related, if OTIO binds Imath and OpenEXR binds Imath, how do we make sure I can pass v2f from one to the other? KimbalL: That is less “maybe” and more “definitely” related to my question - and to be clear, do not expect an answer day one, just didn’t see it clearly in the goals, so wanted to point that out as a thought… JC: They’d probably have to be bound using the same tool (pybind, nano bind) and the tool’s version they were built with would need to have a compatible ABI. For example, pybind11 exposes an ABI that will affect the generated libraries. | Eric (chat): OTIO leans into idiomatic bindings - there are a lot of pluses and minuses. The maintenance overhead is high, but they’re quite nice to use. Michael: In the general Swift/CXX interop tooling that Apple has made available lean into what Larry is talking about - essentially annotate the C++ code to get better bindings. | Eric (chat): +1 to Larry - OTIO’s original design wanted to use a memory management model that made it easier to bind. (Our success level on that goal is open for debate) | . | . | . ",

Will sit in on virtual town halls as well. Please send me any highlights. | . | Dev Days 2024 #662 . | 5 projects officially apply, we are past the deadline, but Carol and Larry said they can still accept projects, don’t need to have every issue identified, but still can register your interest. | Carol: would also like to know from projects who have decided not to participate, what could we do to help you as well. Looking for feedback. | Larry: we’ve been collecting contributions from Projects and WGs, many of the projects are understaffed, so Dev Days is a way to address that. Once we publish the results, hopefully we will get participation from member companies. If you are a project that feels like it is under resources, participating to Dev Days may help. | . | Adjust requirements for the OpenSSF Badge at the Adopted Stage #556 | ASWF PyPI Account . | Please add ASWF account to PyPI to ensure continuity | . | LX calendar . | Waiting for update from team | . | . | Engineering Contribution Survey - Larry . | Contribution Survey | A few projects / companies not yet filled in | Some really interesting trends | On the issue of “fiction”, most organizations report that once they have participated in a project, the median time to send contributions is short. The first PR sent to a project can take a “random” amount of time (typically a few weeks). | Wondering if companies saying what projects matter to them vs what projects see companies contributing to, there seems to be an alignment. | OCIO is saying that they are reporting more contributions from companies than what companies are saying | Area of extended discussion is going to be looking at how we ask companies to report which projects are critical to them. And compare that to what companies report they are dedicating resources, that is quite different. Some projects are used by “everybody” as critical resources, yet only 1 or 2 companies believe they are putting dedicated resources into it. | Shaping up to look like there are some shortfalls, not necessarily in places we expected. | Will report back when we have all the data | David: if you haven’t completed the data, please do. Thank you Larry for setting this up, this is the information we need to decide where to invest to grow our engineering contributions. | Joe Bryant (chat): For O3DE I am finding that many contributors from companies are actually working on the project during off time, and not in official capacity of their company. Maybe this explains the discrepancy? | . | New Working Group Proposal - ASWF Language Interop WG #704 . | Michael: I like the way this is framed. Would be a shame if lessons learned in Rust WG were missed by other language bindings. I’m a fan of Swift so definitely would like to see this work. Doesn’t seem out of left field, Rust has been up and down getting momentum going, may be a good way to get more people involved. | John: are there any concerns? | JF: doesn’t seem to be taking away resources from any other efforts. | John: plan is to fold in the Rust WG? | Tyler yes | JF: we have quorum (just) | Michael: propose, Carol second | All approve, congratulations, will work with you to get things going. | Tyler: thank you! | . | Adjusting Requirements for Project Adopted Stage - John . | Looking at requirements, pulling out requirements for which there isn’t a clear path . | 10 requirements sidelined for now (see PR) | . | Larry: a lot of projects got to passing level easily, but tripped over silver and gold | Hitting the same issues, clusted in 2 areas: . | Things which are outside our area of expertise and unclear how they apply to project, and unclear how to get there. Often around security issues, and beyond our abilities like a security audit | Another group of things that people have a desire to do, but unclear what would allow checking off the item | . | The badging effort clearly had a focus on web facing projects with logins and passwords, a lot of those don’t apply to our projects. We wanted to align the requirements with the scope of what’s relevant to our projects. So this is the list we came down to. | We would like projects to achieve the goal of achieving Silver or better, sidelining those specific requirements | John: Cary did a good job of trailblazing, let’s set up “office hours” between projects leads to share insights gained by Cary. | On the security side of things, we are working on an external group do a “security thread assessment” which should help. It’s a hard area of expertise, ASWF is not unique, I see this in other foundations which struggle in this area. We can bring in support to help give guidance. It’s not always an easy thing to do. | Sounds like a great post siggraph activity. | This gets us on par with a lot of other open source projects. | Spencer: question about the security review: 5 year seems exceedingly long, given the evolving threat environment and code changes. John: yes, valid to do this more often, but cost / time commitment is high. Within 5 years is a typical open source requirement, once we get to a better place we could tighten this requirement. Spencer: would love to be included in any such security discussions. | JF: propose to accept. Jonathan: second. | Adopted! | John: thank you, we won’t kick off “office hours” until after SIGGRAPH | John: projects can apply to graduate based on new requirements. Supposed to be at next review, but could be earlier. Sat with Erik Reineke from OTIO, maybe half a day of work to get it done. | John: will annotate requirements spreadsheet | Larry: there is overlap between projects that report difficulty meeting requirements with projects reporting lack of resources, especially for longer term “strategic” requirements. Highest self reported was 50%. I suspect that every project that isn’t meeting all OpenSSF requirements may think “we want to meet this requirement, we can, but we haven’t had the time”. So looking at Dev Day issues, could be some OpenSSF requirements, could knock out a couple of issues in Dev Days. | John: documentation can be a good entry level way to get involved. Also happy to help / give guidance. This community is good at taking requirements seriously. | . | D&amp;I Accessibility subgroup - Carol . | We have a great guest speaker in July, different day and time, posted to Slack, will be a great talk, please join the call if you are able to, should be a great talk. | . | Rez - creating a sub group - JC . | Sub group for creating environments and launchers | If anyone in the TAC is interested, please reach out | . | The OpenVDB National Anthem . | YouTube Video | . | .

Will update the landscape to add a direct URL. | Have a feature to have an ical icon | Please take next 2 weeks to test this. Probably not high priority before SIGGRAPH, we’ll decommission the lists.aswf.io calendars after SIGGRAPH. If a project wants to keep it, they can, but will be responsible for maintaining them | KimbalL: what’s the domain for the TAC? John: would be under ical.aswf.io but not working yet. | Scott: for the WGs, how are you planning to deal with those? John: we can share source URLs, share through the Landscape | JC: will there be a procedure to transition from mailing list calendar to LFX calendar? Rez still using the mailing list calendar, how will be moving users? John: will be manual / need to communicate directly. If projects want to maintain the original, we can do that. | . | Dev Days 2024 #662 . | 6 projects registered, but still a window to register | registration form and web site will be up next week | . | Open Source Days 2024 #650 . | Update from Emily later in the meeting | . | Engineering Contribution Assessment . | Larry: hoping that next TAC meeting just before SIGGRAPH. Is that still on? John: week we’re doing virtual town halls… | Larry: if we have it, would like to give final update, so if people see each other in person after that, have a topic of conversation. | Carol: would it be better to do it at leadership meeting? Larry: was going to give a couple of high level slides, but may not be time for real discussion. We don’t need to have a meeting just for that. | David: could we have time at the 8AM meeting before open source days? Larry: could be available for that. Also if there’s a slot where there’s no talk in the room we have reserved, could have an informal meeting there as well. Wish I had done this earlier so I could have booked a slot to give a talk on this. But if there is an open slot, I would do it. John: let’s talk offline, we can figure something out. | Only 2-3 projects haven’t updated | . | Atlassian Cloud Migration (Andy) . | Atlassian Cloud Migration | For all the projects that have Atlassian products managed by LF | ASWF is no longer using JIRA | Wiki is having problems for last 3 weeks, trying to figure it out, but hopefully we can put it to the side. | Benefits of Atlassian Cloud . | Costs reduction ($300/$500 per month) | Removal of infrastructure management | Easier scalability | Improved applications dependencies and compatibilities | Obtaining updates and in real time | INcreased availability and reliability | … | . | Easier Scalability . | Cloud systems can scale both vertically… | . | Getting Easy Updates in Real Time . | Atlassian Cloud upgrades the products constantly and in real time, the products are always on the latest version available. | . | Centralized Governance . | Accelerated administration with a centralized mission control center. | . | Improved Security . | Atlassian Cloud products will always have the latest security patches available without any interaction required. | . | Data privacy and compliance | Q3 2024 . | Internal LF JIRA and Confluence have been migrated (June 26) | Q3 - All OSS projects need to be migrated | Next steps after this presentation . | New Atlassian sites are created | Ensure Open Source License for granted… | . | . | Atlassian Jira Standard Tier features . | More information as presented in Atlassian Pricing . | Standard tier | . | User limit per site: 20K instead of 50K | . | FAQ . | Reason for the move | Who do I contact if I ahve further questions, comments or concerns | Can I login to the cloud side using my LFID account | How would I login? . | The users can login at atlassian.com with their email address | . | What can I do if I can’t login to the cloud? | New URLs: . | https://lf-project.atlassian.net | Confluence/Wiki link: https://lf-project.atlassian.net/wiki/home | . | Vanity URLs would require a paid instance | … | . | Kimball: we’ve had issues with plugins, no idea if we’re using them? Andy: we’re having issues with the self hosted version in last 3 weeks, haven’t seen any plugins outside the normal / not cloud compatible. JT: will there be forwarding? Andy: Wiki space will move to the same space name under the new URL, but top level URLs will change. Should be able to do some basic URL forwarding. | JF: could you use LF as an IdP? Andy: related to email addresses. The SAML integration that Atlassian Cloud offers requires that you are locked into a set of domain email addresses. LF identity are based on external email addresses, so we can’t use LF ID as an IdP, even with a paid tier. | JF: seems that Atlassian really wants everyone to move to cloud version. Andy: migrated to datacenter versions last year, we were still getting free licenses. Some Atlassian customers with self-hosted requirements will likely force datacenter to go on for ever. But LF doesn’t really have resources to manage these products, have to patch CVEs regularly, issues managing systems. This is not our “bread and butter”, there have been internal discussions relative to costs passed on to projects, costs likely to go up, tacking on administrative overhead. For now only passing on the cloud costs, not the admin costs. | Andy: current instance is located in EU, so it is GDPR compliant. If we had a force a region, we could use a different region. LF Jira / Confluence was re-homed to the US. | Kimball: we’re having a less than stellar integration with Okta. Andy: LF ID is using Auth0, which is owned by Okta, but we can’t use LF ID anyway. | Gordon: do we have metrics on usage? Andy: don’t have the metrics, especially right now. Had metrics for JIRA which allowed us to turn it off, so that was easier. But this Confluence is used actively. If we wanted to switch to another Wiki, recommendation would be to use the GitHub wiki. A lot less feature full, but tied to everything we’re already doing. | Scott (chat): My only concern is from what I understand, Australia does have laws in place that can break encryption, and Atlassian may have to break encryption if the government asks (as they are an Asustralian company). If this is fine, or I completely misunderstood/misremembered, then cool. Kimball (chat): I’d have to ask / remember, but I feel like they have a mechanism to manage the sovereignty in different regions (if you require), not that I think we particularly care about that? Ben: (chat) The Australian government can only break encryption when organizations refuse or are unable to defend critical infrastructure. I don’t think it would apply here. Scott: Well, worst case, we could always move the wiki to something like mdbook or something. Gary: We’re using the wiki, but could switch to an open-source wiki in a heartbeat. +1 for move to gh wiki — keep things simple. JT: A feature analysis would reveal if any unique or advanced features of our wiki is being used, especially ones that don’t have GH equivalents. Off of the top of my head, many if not most of the advanced features not provided on GH are not being used, just OTH, needs a close look IMO and experience. Ben: It seems silly in hindsight to be held up if it’s mostly just a wiki? Carol: I mean, I get that it’s easy-ish to move going forward, but what about our histories? Let’s move to the cloud first and then decide this move later. Ben: For equations it needs to be GH pages, not wiki. It does not do LaTeX. | Gordon: why did we originally pick this? Andy: at the time Confluence was supported by LF, and GitHub wiki wasn’t very well developed. | John: we will need to do this urgent migration, and we can discuss future migrations after SIGGRAPH | . | OpenQMC . | Guy Martin from NVIDIA presented NVIDIA legal position on IP considerations in OpenQMC project proposal | ASWF to consult with LF for further clarification of IP implications | . | Open Source Days (Emily) . | BoFs not currently posted on the SIGGRAPH site yet (having issues) but posted on ASWF site. | Templates have been posted | David: registered attendees? Emily: 160 in person, 40 virtual. This is fantastic. David: our biggest registration ever! A lot of credit to Emily and team. And thank you for everyone presenting at Town Halls, BoFs and Open Source Days | Carol: what’s the max we can hold in the room? Emily: we may past the max for our room, but you get 50% attrition, and people come in and out during the day, so shouldn’t be an issue. David: we talked about calling it “full”, but for now we’re leaving registration open. | Emily: will touch base with Larry about potential for eng contributions discussion | . | . ",

John: not sure. Andy: not away of anything like that, would need to open support ticket. John: is this to have someone join a specific meeting? Eric: yes, to communicate with guest speakers for instance. John: you may need to have access to the management console. We can ask if there could be an explicit link. Andy: I’ve asked but haven’t had a response yet. Eric: not a showstopper, just an inconvenience | . | Dev Days 2024 #662 . | John: applications are open, but if any project still wants to join | Larry: projects can jump in at any time if you can do the prep. People who are leaders in the company: if you are people who need to / want to participate, time is getting close, especially if there are CLAs to be signed, start that well ahead of time. | . | Engineering Contribution Assessment #685 . | Larry: please watch the video from ASWF Open Source Days on YouTube, nicely encapsulated in the talk | During SIGGRAPH, people were coming up saying information was interesting, and are interested in “matchmaking”, we have resources, and want to get people together | Dev Days is the good first step in that direction, getting a few people familiar with projects | . | Project Proposal - OpenQMC #434 . | Eric E: working in the background on onboarding | Lorna: great conversations internally at SIGGRAPH, looking at paper work, also how we can support to move this forward.

Should we get started in next week or two? Or wait longer? | Carol: if we could push to next month that would be great, projects are working towards releases after SIGGRAPH but don’t want to kick the can too far down the road. | John: Could we look at Aug 28th and block the hour? | Larry: can we impose on Cary to make sure he can be there? Pick a specific issue and walk all the projects through? That could help build momentum | Cary: wanted to offer a hands on, step through how we configured the OpenEXR repo. Not super complicated, I’m out for 10 days between now and 28th, so doesn’t leave much time to prepare. | John: sure, if that’s easier for the group. So Sept 25th instead? Cary: that’s at Dev Days. Is there something simple you could walk us through on Aug 28th? Cary: yes, I should be able to put something together. Some things I don’t have a very deep understanding of, but just followed the instructions. Need to refresh my memory. Also struggling with CodeQL build failures. | John: will get this on the calendar, and we can record. Cary: if you can figure out what you want to tackle. Cary: have some notes on Confluence, that’s what we will go over. | OpenEXR Wiki Project Security Hardening Steps | . | Establish a slack channel for SPK #780 . | Ryan: we announced spk at Digipro, we have a separate Slack instance, people are lukewarm at adding another Slack instance, it would seem like it would be useful to have a channel in ASWF Slack, but it’s not an ASWF project yet. | Larry: there’s a bit of a tension we recognize, we don’t want to be in the business of doling out resources to non-ASWF projects, opens the door to everyone trying to “ride our coat tails”. But we want the ASWF communication channels to handle anything of concern to the members. Some member companies are interested in this project. Do the TAC reps from the members feel we should do this? | John: is there potential interest of this project becoming an ASWF project? Ryan: the project is healthy, it’s not in need of support, we’re not necessarily “in need”, but none of us have anything against that idea. What’s not clear is “who else is going to want to participate”, if it just remains ILM / Imageworks, we have a functional process, so there might not be a gain to become a project. Larry: there’s no rush, there’s no problem with having it incubate where it is. It has proven that to companies can work together. My personal feeling is that it’s not quite in the right stage in its lifecycle to join ASWF, hasn’t become “fundamental” to many people, or unable to grow without it. But could grow into important shared resource, at which point we would not hesitate to submit it. | Carol: we’re just talking about a Slack channel? Anyone has the ability to create one, right? Are we concerned about number of new Slack users? Doesn’t seem to be much. | John: cost aspect is if you have people not already in our Slack instance. | Emily: if we do it, it should be an “unofficial” channel, we don’t want a number of projects to create channels. Maybe it becomes an “interested users” Channel. Larry: Ryan and I are sensitive to not wanting to abuse our position as members, would love to have this disambiguated by someone outside Sony / ILM say “yes this would be useful”. | Larry: let’s continue on its existing Slack channel for now, in the coming months if we see more ASWF members participating, then we can revisit? It sounds like it’s mostly for me and Ryan for now. Ryan: it’s fine, there may be other member studios interested which is my motivation, but happy to revisit in a few months. Larry: let’s let it “bootstrap” until it becomes apparent | . | Open Source Days . | Emily 370 people on site, best attendance to date. Thank you to everyone who participated | Larry: thanks for getting videos up quickly, was able to point people to it. | Emily: links changed due to an edit. Larry: viewer counts as well. | Virtual Town Hall recordings will be up this week | Eric R: loved presentations about topics that wasn’t their own projects, like Kimball’s presentation about making software to last 50 years. Cary: we barely scratched the surface on this topic! Eric: great to get people thinking about this. Would love to hear part 2! | Larry: great keynote by Darin as well. Emily invited him. | . | . ",

It does feel like it’s the right thing, it’s a new project without a lot of adoption yet. JF: this is a from scratch project, not an existing one being onboarded. Carol: would have no issue with renewing in sandbox stage. | John: it feels like the adoption is the only blocker at this point, if that’s an area where we can help with, let us know. Everything else looks like great progress. | Larry: in the high level schematic, is there a “marketing” task to help drive adoption and we could help with? Are people who need to follow this helping to bootstrap? Robert: we’ve been working on getting things “ship shap”, Tom Cowland had been a fantastic champion early on, he is somewhat less involved now, so we need to ramp up the “evangelism”. | John: do we have quorum?

I have a vested interest in making this work, but impressed by the progress. Missed the criteria recap, but seems to be doing quite well and would support move into incubation. | Larry: my thoughts echo this, made incredible progress, and there are clearly people using the components in production, on a solid footing, and wanted to say that SIGGRAPH showing was great. You may have undersold how good the presentations were, and the impressive demos, showed a lot of momentum. This is a real project at this point! | John: some work on the badge requirements, not “impossible” work, that needs to come together, but it’s not that hard, mostly documentation. Erik: will reach back out to John once the Dneg folks are back from vacation. | . | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Scope: an informal meeting where Cary Phillips from OpenEXR shares the work done on OpenEXR to help meet the OpenSSF Best Practices Requirements for ASWF project graduation. | Confluence Page | Based on experience with OpenEXR, not an expert! It’s not rocket science, you can work your way through every step without being an expert. If ayone knows more, happy to hear about it. | Thought sharing experience was worthwhile | Most important is fuzz testing. We’ve been using Google Fuzz testing since 4-5 years. Great service, but requires a fair amount of configuration. Will schedule a later session to focus on that since it’s non trivial. OpenEXR had a fuzz test as part of test suite, so hooking into Google service was reasonable straightforward, but ended up rewriting it (Peter Hilman did this). | Requirement for “security policy”: certain security researchers want vulnerability made public (CVE). Thought it was a demerit and to be avoided, but actually it’s a “good thing” to show publicly resolved CVEs. So when someone reports a vulnerability, fix it. We don’t file CVEs ourselves, but if someone else wants to file one, once the fix has been made, we go through the NIST site and update the info for which releases contain the bug and which fix it. We list them at OpenEXR Security Document | Feel free to copy this security document | Every project should have a security email address, LF can help set up. security@openexr.com forwards to the TSC private email. A few years ago someone sent an email to security@openexr.com but didn’t get a response for a few weeks / months, then filed a public CVE. But turns out their email had been blocked by Google Groups. So no guarantee that an email will land in the right place. | So also enable the GitHub mechanism for filing security advisories. Now that I’ve configured the repo and turned this feature on, the Security tab will now take you directly to the SECURITY.md file. If you don’t have this file, I forget what this looks like. But you should see a Report a Vulnerability button. | Statement of commitment: OpenEXR says acknowledge in 48h, patch in 14 days. Our obligations as project maintainers are serious, 48h / 14 days seems like a reasonable commitment. | For the range of supported versions, borrowed statement from OIIO. Will commit to patching the latest version, and a set of previous releases which may only be patched on request, and some older releases we can’t / won’t patch. | Security Expectations: explaining the nature of the library / project, what it involves, what it does / doesn’t do. A lot of security issues don’t apply to a project like OpenEXR: it has no interface, no web component. So this is a place to make these statements. And here are the steps we’ve taken to make sure it is “legit”. Expected audience is someone who stumbles across the library, and needs to know if there’s some attention to security. We want to show that we are taking these issues seriously. | A lot of issues around security have to do around vulnerabilities from dependencies. OpenEXR has very limited external dependencies, but that’s important to outline. | In general, it would make sense if all ASWF projects followed the same template. If anyone wants to improve on the template, by all means, but feel free to copy and tailor to your project. | Signed releases: I had little to do with OpenEXR before 2018 / ASWF foundation, there was a long history of maintenance of OpenEXR that went on at ILM / Dreamworks / Weta that I was only somewhat aware of. The software was originally hosted on GNU Savannah instead of GitHub. We signed the release tarballs using GnuGPG. On the GitHub release page, what you get “out of the box” on GitHub is the tarball in .zip and .tar.gz format, I don’t know enough about the GitHub implementation, but if you click on the link, you get a download, not sure if it’s created on the fly or pre-created, but that’s the out of the box GitHub feature. Potential vulnerability is that a malicious actor could inject something into the process, so the link gives you something you don’t think it is. So you can not use this feature and instead build the tar file explicitly and generating a key based on the content you know to be good, and then uploading that key so that when someone downloads the specific release artefact that you built, and also downloads the GPGkey, they can use to verify that what you downloaded is what you intended. But you have to manage these GPG keys, which is a pain. The process for OpenEXR sort of fell by the wayside since I didn’t understand it so well. | When it was decided to implement the policy, found the Sigstore service which manages holding the keys. It’s a service you can sign up for which will automatically generate the key file and upload it for you. In openexr/.github/workflows/release-sign.yml it uses the Sigstore service with pre-built GitHub Actions. This workflow is triggered when a releases is published: it downloads the tarball, generates the key, and uploads the key. | In the SECURITY.md, I added a paragraph on how to use sigstore through Python: pip install sigstore ; sigstore verify github --cert.... This seems like a proper implementation of release artefact signing. When there are issues, it comes from Linux distro managers who are very concerned that the code they build and distribute with their OS distribution has been verified. So unlikely to get concern from anyone but distro maintainers. sigstore is a project of the LF / OpenSSF, so it’s the mechanism of choice. | JC: I contributed a change in https://github.com/sigstore/gh-action-sigstore-python for your exact use case so that you can use it without having to manually create the archive. https://github.com/sigstore/gh-action-sigstore-python/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#changed | Stephen Mackenzie: PyPI may also support some kind of signed release, so could be used for Python projects. So maybe there’s a secure way to use GPG keys for PyPI releases. Cary: that’s a good point. OpenEXR’s Python support is 15 years ago someone implemented Python bindings for OpenEXR, published them on PyPI, so if you did pip install openexr it wasn’t our project. It was then abandoned, but someone took it over and turned it over to us. So we’ve only “owned” the OpenEXR package recently. The state of the Python bindings for OpenEXR is “useful enough that some people rely on it”, but no one in film industry uses it (that I know of). So my perspective is that OpenEXR is primarily a C++ library, but that’s in the process of changing it. | We’re using the command line github tool to upload the release artefact. | Signed release tags is another requirement. On the releases page, the green circle with a check, as well as green Verified tags in the tags page. There’s a mechanism to embed a signature in a tag. This is also an option you can enable for the repo, not clear where we enabled that in the repo settings. The individual who will make the release will reference the GPG key in their GitHub local setup. Last step before creating a release is to create the tag for that release. When you draft a release, I don’t let the “publish release” process to create the tag, I create the tag myself with tag -s to associate the signature. I will then publish the release from the pre-created tag. | Gary: Usually you create the key manually, offline, and upload the private key as a secret. Then use the secret in the gh action And upload the pub key to your site for confirmation | Dependabot: I have developed a love / hate relationship with dependabot. It’s a service which mostly keeps your GitHub Actions up to date. | StepSecurity. Enter your GitHub repo and click Analyze, it will file a pull request that enhances your configuration in certain ways. There’s about a half dozen things it does, when I created the Pull Request, it will have a lot of “stuff” in it, better to step through the difference parameters one by one so you can see what it’s suggesting in isolation rather than all at once. | You can pin actions to a SHA instead of a version tag. This will transform your workflow file where actions reference a specific SHA-1 hash, and will put the version in a comment. If your action just says “use this action at this version”, it’s conceivable that a malicious actor could intercept this and run a different action than what you think. Specifying the SHA makes sure you are using the version you think. The workaround that Dependabot uses is the comment after the SHA-1. It makes things a bit harder to read. But this is the stated principle of hardening that’s worth instituting. | When you configure this, Dependabot will send PRs to upgrade to new versions, for instance yesterday got a PR to bump a SHA for codeql, and somehow only the last of 3 changes as the version as a comment. | What I don’t like about dependabot is that’s it’s a constant stream of updates, maybe that’s good, “cost of doing business”, but it feels like a lot of change / churn. Seems we’re getting more dependabot PRs rather than real code updates, it clutters your PR list. But upside is that it’s important to stay on top of your GHA dependencies. | When the PR comes through, provides a description of what changed, but typically don’t have a deep understanding of what it means. In one case accepted a change which broke something in our CI. codeql started failing, was a regression in one of the releases, notified them and they are working on it. You will get a deluge of updates, you will have to decide how to deal with it. Constant updates / stay on bleeding edge, or more intermittently. You can respond in a comment with a special @dependabot comment that can shut it up about certain things. For instance our website doesn’t build with latest version of Sphinx, so you can tell dependabot to ignore major versions, but still provide updates to version in use. | JC: you can also configure it via the .github folder, there’s a dependabot config file, there’s a parameter where you can specify a version range for your dependencies. Cary: yes, we have a .github/dependabot.yml as well as using the PR comments. https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#ignore | I set up Dependabot SHA pinning through stepsecurity.io, which was my introduction to it. Also workflows should have write permissions only where explicitly requested. Every workflow should have a permissions: contents: read and only add write for sections where you upload a build artefact. Someone contacted me to show that this is the proper configuration to make sure that by default workflows shouldn’t be able to modify the repo. Restrict permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN in stepsecurity.io does this. | John: would it make sense to scope one or two of these items that would be good to start with? What would be 2 things that would be good to have everyone do? Cary: maybe do a sweep through the projects to see which ones are doing these things and which are not. All of this is “drop in” easy to do, just takes a bit of someone’s time to read through the documentation and figure out what to do. When the idea of this session came up, I could take the release signing workflow and submit a PR to projects that don’t have it, but I think it’s better for someone on the project to do it. Stephen: yes, should be better to distribute the knowledge / work. I wonder if maybe there’s a more granular way to handle it. Maybe we can pick one item per month, for instance OSS-Fuzz, next month it’s signed releases, and so on. John: signed releases are a good example of something that’s fairly “drop in” to do, not a tremendous amount of work, especially since there’s a template. Maybe that’s a good starting point? Could we get everyone to do that, and at the next meeting figure out if there are any issues? Cary: currently approach is that every project has the badge requirements, and it’s up to them to work through the requirements according to their resources. What if we flipped this around and said “let’s get every project set up with signed releases?”. John: that makes sense, try what you have done here, see if it works for them, come back at next call, see if there are pain points, and figure out how to get projects not on the call to do this. Cary: would be good to look at the badge requirements spreadsheet, get everyone to step through the issues together. | That kind of thing may align with Dev Days, except we don’t want newbies doing this. John: could be something we push through the TAC. Most of the projects have struggled getting signed releases going, so could be a good one to get started? JC: each project releases differently, have talked to most of the projects as to how they release they Python bindings, everyone does it slightly differently, which is normal. So signing could be tricky for some projects like MaterialX. Would like to build some resources for this. | John: #1 thing that every project misses is signed releases, so that sounds like a good one to start. We may not hit 100% of the use cases, maybe find the oddballs, next new project that comes in, here’s how to do signed releases, here are exceptions… Seems like a common problem everyone has. Not trivial, but not hard. | Cary: OpenEXR is simplest from a structure point of view since we just build C++ libraries. What I’ve done applies to the simplest projects, may be more involved for other projects. John: for now we’re trying to sign the source releases, not the binaries. JC: there are 2 aspects to signing: you can sign like what Cary did on OpenEXR, and then there’s attestation / provenance, “SLSA framework”: you sign your releases, but also provide a trace / proof of how it was generated, and prove it wasn’t tampered in any way. That’s the next level, what OpenEXR is doing is already a good step. John: yes, this is where everyone needs to go over time. JC: GitHub supports SLSA natively, it’s built in in some ways. You can now have an attestation tab. This Git entry is for Go, there are others as well. | Cary: based on the spreadsheet, will file issues with projects on how to address what we’ve talked about here. | John: will make a call out to technical project leads, point them to your instructions, and follow up at next call. | .

Each has a team: . | Session One – September 9 at 4:00 pm PT: Picking a project, CLAs, and general participation questions. Meeting Link. Session Two – September 16 at 10:00 am PT: Picking an issue and GitHub related questions. Meeting Link. Session Three – September 23 at 4:00 pm PT: CMake and build environments. Meeting Link. | . | If you want to support office hours / participate, that would be more than welcome. | . | Office Hours Update . | Brain Dump from Cary on security work done on OpenEXR | Call for action: implement signed releases and signed tags for every project | Let’s have all projects work through small chunks, and iterate through the requirements. | All leads were invited, but anyone can join | Meeting Link | Recording | Matthew Low (chat): Would it be possible to reschedule Project Leads Office Hours to a time that doesn’t conflict with existing ASWF meetings? The current schedule conflicts w/ the USD Working Group | . | LFX Voting - Yarille . | Two votes went out via LFX voting, if you didn’t get an email with the call for vote, it goes directly to voting members. Would be great to close out these two votes. | John: we got positive feedback from the process. | Kimball: yes, was easy to login and click vote | . | Update on OpenQMC . | John / Framestore: talked to Eric E at SIGGRAPH, got a lot of feedback, should be able to come back to TAC at next meeting. | John M: yes should be able to cover in next TAC meeting | Eric E: may take a bit longer to get feedback from NVIDIA | . | OpenAPV Project Proposal - Youngkon Lim . | Slide Deck | Main reason behind joining ASWF activities | APV - Advanced Professional Video Codec | Motivation . | Improvement of smartphone cameras . | multiple lenses, 100x zoom, 200M pixel, RAW formats | . | Increasing demands on beyond consumer quality video with smartphones . | Smartphones are much easier to carry and convenient to set up | Content creators targeting SNS platform uses smartphone | Cloud based post production tools are getting popular | . | Conventional video codecs such as AVC, HEVC, VVC, AV1 are not suitable for professional use as they have been designed for lossy compression of video for mass distribution | Professional Video Codec . | main purpose: capturing video for post production (multiple rounds of various types of editing) | coding tools: intra frame coding only | target quality: visually lossless | target bitrate: 200 mbps - 2gbps | . | Conventional Video Codec . | Encoding video for mass distribution | Coding tools: Intra and Inter frame coding | Target quality: lossy | Target Bitrate: 1mbps - 50mbps | . | . | Strategy . | Industry needs a free public open professional video codec . | No professional video codecs available as open standard, open source SW, royalty free . | APV at intersection of: . | Royalty Free | Public Standard | Open Source: easily accessible / implementable | . | . | . | . | APV - Advanced Professional Video . | Professional video codec designed for resource constrained devices . | Very low complexity (less than JPEG) | SW implementation on encoders on smartphones and desktop/laptop/cloud computers | . | High throughput, high fidelity oriented . | Intra-only coding for supporting easy editing | tile structure coding for parallel processing | entropy coding for high-birtate up to several gbps | no loop/post filter to increase pixel precision | . | Better compression efficiency than other professional video codec . | around 20% better than well-known professional video codec for 2K, 4K video (4:2:2) | . | . | OpenAPV . | Advanced Professional Video Codec has been developed with the technologies more than 20 year old only to be royalty (risk) free | Specification of APV will be published as IETF RFCs for free public access . | Advanced Professional Video | RTP payload format for APV | . | OpenAPV project to develop / distribution open source SW of APV . | Preferred license is BSD 3-clause (no concerns about the patents) | Samsung is ready to contribute the complete encoder / decoder implementation to kick start the process | . | . | EVS Essential Video Codec . | Royalty (risk) free video codec for general contents distribution . | Baseline profile is built with more than 20 year old technologies | Standardized as ISO/IEC 23094-1 (MPEG-5 Part 1) | . | Compression efficiency of baseline profile is comparable to HEVC and encoding profile… | . | Questions . | Eric R: how would you compare to JPEG-2000, and have you had dialogue with Alliance for Open Media who developers AV1. | Don’t have direct comparison against J2K, but can ask engineers | Samsung is member of AOM, had considered AOM venue for this codec, but it was complicated. The codec is very simple compared to AV1, so OK to developer by ourselves. | . | Larry: a very exciting project, would like to touch on licensing issue. Based on my experience, a lot of people would be more comfortable with Apache 2, I appreciate that you are trying to make it low risk by only using 20 year old technologies to mitigate patent issues. But Apache 2 can be helpful since the project won’t be static, there will be contributions, Apache gives more insurance that additions to project don’t add patent encumbrance. I understand the difficulty of releasing under Apache 2, but in order to consume the resulting code, Apache 2 gives more guarantees in the future. Extra safety from Apache 2 may be worth it in the future. Great presentation. | We are already comparing Apache 2 vs BSD internally, also if ASWF prefers Apache 2, that’s a factor. We feel that BSD 3-Clause may be more open, but Apache 2 may be better for future contributions. | . | Kimball: remember to consider that we often need tiled capabilities so we don’t have to decode the whole frame, is that possible? Also we typically need higher bit depth. | We definitely consider that point, we have tiled support, each tile can be individually encoded / decoded. | You can look at IETF draft and see the supported profiles, including 10 and 12 bit. | . | Eric R: support for Alpha channels? . | Yes, support for additional channels | . | Eric R: ability to store 4:4:4? . | Yes, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 | . | Carol: we talked a bit about ASWF vs AOM, what do you expect from ASWF, why is it important for you to join ASWF for this project? Visibility / adoption from our members? . | AOM is super busy for AV2 which is more a distribution codec, so don’t want to divert their focus. Also for this type of codec, more aligned with ASWF requirements (professional grade codecs). So for APV we feel it aligns more with ASWF. | Carol: that makes sense. When we accept new projects in sandbox mode, I like to ask what the contributing company expects to get out of it. Commitment to making it open is awesome. People from our community should have some interest. | We’ve looked at other projects in ASWF and saw synergies with other projects. | . | JF: where do you see initial resources commitment coming from? . | This may not require initial development, but we may want to see this integrated in multiple projects, optimization, integration in apps. We have some pre-discussions with several companies interested in joining the activity, so there could be people outside ASWF interested in joining the work. ORI could be interested in using the codec. So we can have some contributions this way. And Samsung will dedicate some people to support the activity. We expect engineers to join. | . | Larry: is the codec GPU friendly? . | Not tested yet, codec targets resource constrained environments but we can test. | We support HDR | . | . | John: TAC will take some time to digest the proposal and take a vote offline. We will work to “tee this up”. | . | Don’t think we have anyone from Zero Trust WG on the call, so we will reschedule. | . ",

We don’t have visibility into that. | Jonathan: lots of new folks coming into the channel, but none have asked about specific issues. Maybe share the raw numbers we should expect? | Yarille: should have updated numbers - 80 | Larry: will tell us the number of who signed up, but doesn’t break down by project unless they volunteer the info. Sometimes people jump around at the last minute. | Carol: we increased since the last time, after PR posts. Everybody should still repost in your networks the blog post. Would be good to put something in your channel about Dev Days explicitly. Please look at Good First Issues for instance. | Larry: would like to know if there are companies with large blocks of people participating | JT (chat): I think I mentioned custom github tag for dev days last year, used like the good first issue tag, that seems like a good idea to me for people that will scan the repo for inspiration. | Eric R (chat): OTIO has had two people reach out to say they intend to participate | . | Project Leads Office Hours #760 . | Next week, we know it’s hard to mix with TAC / USD | Working on signed releases, Cary put together great material, a couple of projects have taken this on | Identify a project that hasn’t done it and help | . | . | Proposal to vote on MaterialX becoming an Adopted member #840 . | Jonathan: we presented to the group in February, overview of our projects.

How many projects in ASWF leverage these assets? Can we show that these assets are being used for existing projects, do we have that visibility. Also any modifications to OpenPBR model, I can help with that. Matthew: we got the contribution agreement signed, will stand up GitHub repo tomorrow and get first contribution added. We are in a great spot. | John: we will take this to LFX vote! | . | . | OpenAPV #803 . | Youngkwon: we had internal discussion about Apache via BSD 3-Clause, we see that BSD 3-Clause has benefits over Apache 2, cannot verbally summarize it, but can share what our legal counsel says. Could be similar to OpenEXR? Larry: most of these projects existed before Apache 2.0 existed, and the license switch would have been too difficult. If those projects started today, they might have started with a different license. Youngkwon: we still prefer BSD 3-Clause unless ASWF has real issue with that. | Carol (chat): Yeah OCIO just can’t switch | Larry (chat): OIIO did switch when it entered the foundation, after 15 years of BSD (which it chose in 2008 only because that was the common one at the time). | Matthew (chat): OpenVDB also recently relicensed | Comparison with other codecs: we don’t have a license for ProRes, our engineers have some tests based on ffmpeg, it shows that OpenAPV has a bit more gain (19%). Eric R: when you say ffmpeg implementation, is that using ffmpeg implementation of ProRes? Youngkown: hard to confirm that, that implementation hasn’t been “blessed” by the owner. Eric: wanted to see an indepth analysis of where it sits in the codec landscape, looking forward to JPEG family codecs. Especially HT J2K for instance, already available inside Resolve, then OpenJPEG implementation of that codec. So maybe a good one to one comparison? Taking on the work of bringing in a new codec into the world is a long path to adopting a codec. There’s all the work around standardizing the container around the codec, what would we advocate. Want to start from metrics to see that the codec is worth putting the effort into. Youngkwon: we don’t have a direct comparison with H2K, but can be compared indirectly through ffmpeg implementations. We also have considered HT J2K, but had issues with patents / IP. Eric R: we haven’t seen IP issues for HT J2K, but can depend on the context / point of view. Youngkown: yes, different between a service provider vs a device manufacturer. | Youngkwon: about the performance comparison, can’t provide official numbers for now, but we have tested APV on flagship phones, S series, full HD 1920x1080 60P 4:2:2 10 bit video, target bit rate of 400 mbps, phone could encode up to 120 FPS, decoding a bit more complex, around 86 FPS. Target was to encode 4K 60P in real-time, so in that range of complexity. | Sam: are you going to release an ffmpeg patch? Youngkwon: working on it, will release it source code that way. Simple GitHub under OpenAPV org, can grab it that way and test it. Sam: do you think you can add something to the APV repo talking about licensing? Would be great to have a summary on the web site to point legal council to so we can convince them to add the codec. Youngkown: we do have licensing terms there. Just the standard BSD 3-Clause license. Sam: would be good to have a description that there are no known IP issues. Eric R: the license is the copyright on the code, but is there an attestation that the code is no IP encumbered. Don’t know if there’s legal language that’s typically used for that? Youngkwon: we could mention some of that. We have done extensive search on existing literature and have found nothing newer than 20 years, and haven’t added anything patents held by us. There could always be a surprise, but based on knowledge and process, we don’t believe there are applicable patents. | Larry (chat): Apache-2.0 says that the contributors of the code attest that any patents they may hold on it are considered licensed for use in the context of using that code base. | John: we are at the hour, so we can continue the conversation. Youngkown: can continue discussion via email / Slack | . | . ",

    "content": ". | John: timing for this call was brought up. Running into issue that there’s no good time slot, this time conflicts with USD meetings (off cadence from TAC), but also avoids some other conflicts. Or should we have a secondary timeslot that we would flip between the two? Larry: sounds reasonable, as long as they are recorded. Gary: I’m flexible so good with me. | John: if we picked a second time, what would that be? Stephen: best answered by people who couldn’t attend today. John: main conflict with USD? JF: same with WG CI. Stephen: timeband between noon and 4PM Easter is crowded. Larry: any earlier than this cuts out Australia / New Zealand. John: do we look at a later time? Would work better later? But then can be an issue for Europe. | John: Tuesday could be a bit more open. | JF: is there enough overlap with CI WG to want to merge? Stephen: does LFX tools have heat map of best attended meeting? Overlapping with another meeting may not be that big of an issue if the other meeting has fewer attendees? John: we have data on attendees, USD WG has 217 people who registered. | We could try for the DPEL TSC meeting on Tuesdays at one. | JF: if every project moves to adopted phase, are we done? | John: will put out poll on the tech leads channel of sticking to current slot vs Tuesday offset from DPEL TSC. | . | Signing releases . | MaterialX did it, and moved on their graduation | Other project leads, any feedback? | Gary: giving it a try now, instructions are clear. Mostly stuck on how to test it without generating lots of extra releases. Larry: “release and hope it works”? Gary: yes, I could do that. But would like to see it run end to end. | John: have to ‘test in production’? Gary: workflow based on tags and releases. Eric: haven’t worked through this yet, hopefully next week. In general any of the work we do are happening in normal CI builds, release just promotes artifacts to PyPI. Not sure what the expense is to cryptographically sign every build we do. John: intention is not every build, but every release. Eric: but if every build is signed, then every build is a release candidate. When we create a release, it just grabs the artifacts from the build and promotes those. Gary: using release-sign.yml which does something different. Eric: makes sense to only sign the release, doesn’t really matter either way? Gary: it does matter to testing though, don’t want a “weird” release sitting up GitHub that you have to delete / move tags around. | John: this adds an artifact to the existing release? You can try putting this in place. Eric: can you manually trigger an action? Gary: yes, I added the manual trigger, but then it doesn’t have a tag. I can probably debug that, hardwire an existing tag. But was wondering what everybody else is doing. | John: can you unpublish releases? Gary: yes. John: could you unpublish and republish an old release? Gary: yes, that’s an interesting idea, I’ll try it. | John: based on Eric’s process, this would sit on the end of the process? Eric: yes, we are creating a release in GitHub. Would merge this to our workflow of “stuff that happens on a release”. We have one that is the same trigger on release publish. We need to make this happen before the PyPI publish since the signature has to show on PyPI. Gary: as long as you don’t have to re-download the artifacts. I don’t have anything that happens “on publish”. Eric: will look how this will work with PyPI. We’re using a PyPA GitHub action, you may be able to pass it the signing artifacts. | Eric: looks like PyPI Publish can generate its own attestation objects. So may not need this whole workflow at all? But we’ll want to sign the source artifacts. Makes dealing with PyPI specifics easier. John: PyPI steering packages towards doing this. Eric: would be good if this was done more extensively. | John: looks like we have OpenFX in progress, and OTIO soon. | Larry: haven’t started yet, it’s on my list, looking to have the time. Missed the first office hours with Cary. | Stephen: same story for Rez. We do our OpenSSF in big batches, Jean-Christophe has done a lot. We marked Cary’s ticket as a duplicate since we already had a ticket. | John: we have people who now have experience so can help answer questions. Maybe use the #technical-leads channel to ask for help. | Stephen: for reproducibility of GitHub Actions, there are solutions out there for ways to run a local GitHub Actions container as a local host that you connect to your project, there are different ways to debug GitHub Actions “live”. Could be something we should be aware of across projects, how you can dig in and debug stuff without having to make a release. JF: could be a topic for WG-CI, or a Wiki article. Gary: you want to be able to run workflows with simulated triggers. Stephen: there’s another approach where the GitHub Actions can install a tool that you can attach to remotely. There is likely a well known approach. ACT | Eric: tool to debug actions you are developing | Eric: there should be a way to have a dry run of a release. But so many things in action are built to have side effects. | Gary: if CI WG had recommendations / walkthroughs for GHA debugging / local runs, that would be very helpful. | . | Dependabot . | John: are projects using Dependabot to keep actions up to date? | Stephen: those updates can be annoying | John: you can group them and reduce frequency? | Stephen: yes we do that. Dependabot at first wasn’t helpful, there’s a major update in something we relied on, and Dependabot was complaining about something we couldn’t update. | JF: Stephen helped aswf-docker to move past logjam, but it’s now asking for a new version of Python Black which another dependency doesn’t support yet. | Eric: you can tell it to ignore certain dependencies for a while. | Stephen: Rez vendors several of its dependencies, so Dependabot doesn’t know about these | Larry: other projects have trouble incorporating Dependabot paradigm since they are trying to be able to build in different environments they need to build in, like studio environments. There isn’t a single nailed down environment, including older environments. Haven’t turned it on for my projects, since not sure how to deal with the noise it would generate. | John: main requirement is to have a mechanism to stay on top of dependencies, Dependabot is a mechanism for that, but doesn’t work as well for C/C++. Larry: what does it mean to “stay on top of it?” John: “project must monitor or periodically check their external dependencies”. Larry: there may not be a single version of external dependencies, you may have to support building against a range of versions, even known insecure ones. Eric: perhaps the intent was if you are generating binary artifacts you are downloading? Larry: not generating binaries for now, but will be generating Python wheels. For that purpose, we can make sure that for the binaries we build, we use “acceptable” versions. Larry: we feel obligated to run CI against wide range of versions. If / when we produce binaries, those will have to be built against “known good” dependencies. | John: if someone were to pull your code and pull dependencies themselves, they should be able to get the “good ones”? Larry: both of the projects I run test not only against VFX Platform, but also latest versions, and sometimes from main / nightly / top of tree to guard against surprises. Stephen: sometimes a lot of Dependabot updating is to keep 2 things under control: does your CI system have vulnerabilities and could supply chain attack people downstream of you, and are the things that your project works with will create downstream supply chain attacks by projects that use yours. Most ASWF projects aren’t getting used in that context? It may be irrelevant for some projects. | John: SBOMs can also help mitigate, attestation of dependencies and known vulnerabilities. The point is to pay attention to dependencies! End users can make decisions for their own use cases. | Eric: the OpenSSF lets you enter a description string / qualifier, so projects can document that way that they support builds against older versions? John: true, but the idea is to attest that we pay attention to dependencies. Doesn’t mean you can’t test against older / vulnerable versions. | . | Sounds like signed releases is still the outstanding TODO, setting up StepSecurity may be a good objective, in particular pining actions to specific SHA-1 hashes | .

    "content": ". | General Updates . | Move Technical Charter and license scan requirements to the Sandbox s #824 . | Reflected the need to address all housekeeping tasks before project proposal to TAC, for instance had issue with project naming | Also license scanning | Before we get to sandbox stage | Eric: for license scan, what if a process wants to get into sandbox to get access to resources for a license scan? John: if they are needing that, LF can do that ahead of time, and help isolate potential issues. So they can have good guidance when they get to the TAC. We’re not expecting 100% perfect, but want to check major items. Catch anything that says “proprietary” for instance. Started doing that with many projects, sometimes TAC doesn’t catch it and that delays the process. | . | OpenQMC #434 . | No updates | . | Create voting guidelines #855 . | Misalignment on voting expectations for OpenAPV | PR should align with our process we tend to follow, but wanted to codify it. Specific to the TAC, but could be adopted by TSC. | JF: will add comment to PR about determining quorum | . | Dev Days 2024 #662 . | John: chart posted to TSC leads | Carol: we will want to reserve time in future TAC meeting for feedback. We want to get the ‘non tangible’ stuff in, get feedback from projects. Overall seems to have gone OK, different projects had different experiences, which is fine. No major problems from what I could tell. | Larry: still evolving, sometimes people don’t finish the work on the day, but may still be a few cycles of comments / reviews. | John: also a few PRs didn’t get tagged for dev days. We doubled number of PRs from last year, 33% increase on closed PRs. Good overall, will work on final report. | . | Project Leads Office Hours #760 . | Trying to get second time slot | . | upgrade GPUs of CI runners #863 . | Ken: adopted new project that can do learning on sparse VDBs. Jonathan: hardware available as CI runner has a T4 GPU, lacks the data format we need to run our tests, generation before Ampere generation that has Tensor Flow 32 format that is needed to validate some of our kernels. Also FP8 came out with Hopper generation. Have other projects needed similar requirements? | Ken: GPUs on CI runners have old GPUs, we need newer GPUs, as NVIDIA we should be part of the solution. Is there someone on the TAC I can work with so we can potentially work with to resolve this? Also if there are other projects with similar issues, we would like to talk to you. | Jonathan: T4 are Tesla generation cards from 2018, there have been newer data formats on later GPUs that we need for testing. | Larry: my experience is on using GPUs for graphics, for years and years NVIDIA has had a good track record of forward and backward compatibility, is this a performance issue, or you can’t run at all on the T4s? Jonathan: it’s code specifically written for these data formats, but FP32 is a 19 bit float format that only exists on newer generation cards. We can test validity of operator on other formats, but not these ones. | Andy: we’re using GitHub hosted runners, unless NVIDIA were to work with Microsoft / Azure / GitHub (GitHub hosted runners are hosted on Azure). There’s also the option of AWS CodeBuild (used by OCIO), so if CodeBuild offers newer GPUs, that’s an option. | Eric R: you can self host a GitHub runner if they have hardware sitting in a rack. Andy: yes, this is also an option. Erik: they would also have to manage those runners. | JF: self hosted may be the most realistic option. John: should this go to CI WG? Jonathan: bringing this to TAC, the idea was to see if other projects had this requirement. We’ll work with CI WG for an implementation. | Eric E (chat): Wonder if other OSS PyTorch projects have this issue. Andrew: PyTorch is 100% on AWS. They do not currently use GH hosted runners at all. | . | Security Threat model analysis for ASWF projects #615 . | Talked to two project leads who seem interested | Need to talk with the board to budget this | If this go well and the projects get good value, we could have recurring annual budget, and TAC can work on prioritization | Comment on GH issue if you have thoughts | Would be useful to bring in outside professional resources | . | . | OpenAPV #803 . | Pre-Read: Commentary on OpenAPV | Sam: can talk in context of OpenRV and xStudio. An issue we have when building executables is that we need open source codecs we can build into it, have been trying to cheerlead AV1 / VP9 which are excellent codecs but designed for web playback. What we’re missing is equivalent of ProRes / DNxHD which are intra-frame codecs, designed for acquisition or editorial. Not inter-frame compression, very fast to compress / decompress, gave examples of other open source codecs which exist but don’t have a lot of development. | Potential of Samsung delivering a ProRes equivalent that we could be using that is open source, actively under development is important not just for acquisition / editorial, but also lots of studios do all their in house reviews with codecs like ProRes. | If there were variants of ProRes that were open source we would use them, but that doesn’t currently exist. OpenAPV has a lot of interesting features, not having licensing issues. As a roadmap issue, we’re mostly missing 4:4:4 encoding, extended bit depth, RGB, those are interesting roadmap items. Could be used during reviews and other in-house uses. | If ASWF could work with Samsung to take better advantage by embedding OCIO, or work with SMPTE RIS committee to standardize camera metadata. Could capture focal length, focus distance on a per frame basis, could be really interesting. We have a lot of experience on this within ASWF, having Samsung joining ASWF and being active in this project, this could turn into an extremely interesting codec. Our core need of having an open source substitute for ProRes would be very helpful. | Erik R: as OpenAPV is proposed, it’s just a codec, not a container format, right? Is there an example within a container format? Youngkwon: working on ISO BMF (sp?). Erik: container format would dictate ability to carry metadata, ISO BMF may not have solved this. Want to highlight that metadata is more about container format. Youngkwon: we’ve been working mostly on camera side, our metadata design is more frame based, embedded in the bitstream, data generated by the device. When doing editing / processing, there’s other types of metadata, for instance in MXF. We add to ISO BMF, which is continuously evolving. I’ve been working on that for many years, if it’s not sufficient, we can improve ISO BMF, or look at another binding. | Erik R: have internal conversations at Netflix about what it would look like to add per-frame metadata to ISO BMFF. Would like to have conversations with you about that. You said there’s medata in the bitstream, is it usually about how to interpret pixel information, like if you have a multi-view source, dolby vision, HDR 10+, what source of data is in the bitstream? Youngkwon: we have compiled list of metadata that can be generated by the camera: what kind of device, lens, characteristics, location / time, we can add HDR related information, it’s that kind of data. Somewhat like EXIF data. | Carol: from OCIO perspective, would be excited to have a partner to embed OCIO data in a codec. But it would need to work in other codecs as well. It’s more about the container than the codec. | Sam: colorspace wouldn’t be per frame, but it’s not something that’s well defined within container. So if we can collaborate and establish a precedent that we can use with other codesc, would be a win. | Erik R: BMFF has the COLR tag, encodes colorspace metadata, but not clear on how. | Does APV support random access to a frame? Sam: I’ve mostly used it for individual frames, should work to merge into a single file. Erik R: supports tiled decoding. HTJ2K is a codec, not a container format, can put it in .j2c files, but usually put it in a MXF file which provides frame indicies. Can also do tiled decoding. | John: where is every one at with respect to this? Erik R: there’s a landscape of other codecs in this realm, don’t know that we’ve seen a “bake off”, or specific shortcomings. Some of the specific features stated in this document haven’t been put in a matrix. Do we want to put effort behind OpenAPV, or do we want to try to push other codecs over the line. From my perspective, when I look at it with AV1 developers, haven’t seen really good analysis using accepted metrics in the codec space, and see where it lies on the chart. | John: proposal is to have it within Sandbox, lots of foundations use that stage to “shake out” alignment issues. If it looks like it doesn’t get there, the sandbox can be the exit stage as well. | Sam: would be a good use of the sandbox so we can “kick the tires”. There aren’t a lot of alternatives in this area: Cineform and J2K are the only 2 I know about, I’ve been trying to push AV1, but it isn’t great for this particular use case due to slower encoding (and sometimes decoding). Worth testing, have been doing same benchmarks as other codecs, but haven’t generated numbers yet. | Erik R: curious why we can’t have these metrics as part of the proposal. Shouldn’t be too hard to run “competitive test set”, shouldn’t require foundation resources to do? | Larry: we may be over scrutinizing for a sandbox project, in the past we haven’t put this threshold of “is it better than all other projects”. It seems like Sam’s report says it could fill an important role, we can give it “shelter” as it grows up. | John: we could add a 6 month check in for a sandbox stage project. | Erik R: my main point is that I don’t know where this codec lands at all, and it should be possible to answer the question. The previous projects we’ve adopted were already widely used, this is a bit different, something we would be doing more “zero to one” work, which can be a big lift in the codec space. | Michael Min: we’ve asked the question of Rez for instance. For instance the OpenAssetIO repo hasn’t been updated in a while, maybe we need to be more rigorous with sandbox projects, but I think this is a reasonable sandbox project. | John: also something can’t live indefinitely in sandbox. I’ve seen other TACs to use sandbox stage for early collaboration. | Carol: sandbox is different than incubating, closest analogy might be OpenAssetIO, a brand new project, they are currently building it, and we see the need for it. | Youngkwon: we brought this to ASWF since we aren’t experts in content creation industry. We know how to evaluate acquisition codecs, but not in the content creation space. But we have something to start with, and would like to work together to improve it. A good exercise for us is to figure out how to compare it. So the concept of sandbox seems appropriate for this. We are interested in having an opportunity to work with ASWF, maybe later on we decide it’s not worth adoption, but would be good to have opportunity to learn and contribute. | John: this group hasn’t done a lot of sandbox projects, but trying to apply experience from other LF foundations. | Cary: this isn’t coming out from “out in the weeds”, Sam / Jay / Erik are well respected in the industry, so if they think this is a good idea, it likely is. | Erik R: from ORI perspective, if the thought is that we need a codec to do “X” (an intra-frame codec that meets licensing requirements and meets requirements), what if we talk a WG from that perspective to figure out what’s the codec that makes the most sense, if we find that it’s OpenAPV (with work), we can use that? | Sam: I’m hoping that Samsung will be doing bulk of development, but what we’re bringing is the expertise on cine camera and vfx production side. So this isn’t a project from us in terms of coding, but we can mutually gain in a better product through collaboration. Youngkwon: yes, we have lots of expertise on codec development, encoding methods, preserving color, complexity tradeoffs. Sam: the idea that we should be continuing to vet all codecs, that’s a lot of what I’ve been doing with Encoding Guidelines, want to continue doing this and don’t think we should be dissuading people from using ProRes / DNxHD, and they may end up open sourcing? We don’t want to have lots of codecs in ASWF, but it doesn’t hurt to have at least one that we have reasonable development effort behind and that we can embed. Also apps such as Maya could embed it. We need to be looking beyond just RV / xStudio: how does our industry create content, and what’s required to get DCC vendors to include codecs. Maya currently really only has MotionJPEG. Erik R: there’s a gap, I agree. HTJ2K has a lead, already integrated into a set of applications, there’s been development effort behind creating accelerated libraries to get even more performance. Theoretically fills the same gap. Since we don’t have metrics, not sure what it would take to “catching up” OpenAPV to HTJ2K, we might be taking on something that works perfectly fine (HTJ2K) and switching courses from it and fracturing our efforts. HTJ2K already in Resolve and other apps. Also part of IMF spec, some of us will start delivering HTJ2K for distribution. The lead time it takes to proliferate into products, silicon implementations… Maybe that’s something we can do in sandbox phase, but I think it should be possible to generate data for submission. | John: we see different TACs deal different when projects take competitive position. We’ve seen more and more TACs taking the perspective that if there’s alignment, people behind that can make it happen, then use sandbox mechanism to nurture it and “let the market decide”. Some TACs try to be a bit more forward and say “there’s already an established leader”. But we see TACs being a bit broader and use sandbox as a mechanism to determine this. | Youngkwon: is the idea to select the “best possible codec”, or work with us on APV in this context? We’ve been struggling on what’s the best way to compare, content to compare, coding conditions to use… So many variables, we’re also interested in learning about this so we can have a correct comparison. We know how to compare consumer codecs, but may not apply for professional codecs. That’s an exercise that we are interested in, and could be first mandate for the project. | Sam: we can pick a milestone 6 months or a year out to do an evaluation, to really see how APV compares to HTJ2K. Will take time to do both, we may find there’s value in both, particularly with the multi-layer datasets, that’s not in HTJ2K, and could be nice to have. So may have value to have both. | John: so we could have a specification that would need a review in 6 months? Erik R: we should lay out expectations of sandbox period, that could make sense. After an amount of time, we want to understand how this fits in a landscape of existing codecs. | John: should we vote on this? Erik: we should define expectations before we take a vote. John: Erik says we should have structure, there’s time sensitivity, do you think it’s OK if the TAC can come up with 6 months vs 1 year, is that OK? Youngkwon: yes, that’s OK, takes a long time to do evaluations, can be interesting exercise to define how to compare with other codecs, if that can be done in 6 months. | John: OK to do offline vote with 6 month stipulation? | John: we’ll propose a vote with specific 6 month review requirements. | David: Erik R, if you can help define that goal, what you want to see, that would be very helpful. Erik R: have dropped a comment asking for 1 specific set of metrics. Sam’s document talks more about other dimensions than just image quality. I can work with Sam on this stuff, we can work together. Sam: yes, we can add to this document or start a new one. We’ll chat and get brief verbiage together. Erik R: as we identify dimensions we think are important, I can reach out to AV1 and VMAF teams and ask for evaluation criteria we are interested in. The AV1 and VMAF team is keep on what’s important to content creators. Youngkwon: that sounds very interesting. | John: we’ll get the vote rolling, Erik and Sam will collaborate on 6 month review point. Is that right? OK? | Kimball (chat): am keen to hear how the group thinks we should balance requests like OpenAPV vs. the (current) request to add jp2k as a compression type into OpenEXR… love seeing more open standards… | Eric E (chat): Does HTJ2K support random access to a frame? | Eric R (chat): Personally - I think this metadata stuff all should be in the container, not the codec. | Rob (chat): I just built openapv for the first time and have a tech question. Who do I contact to follow up? | Spencer (chat): re licensing/patent claims an issue. AV1 has two patent pools that want to collect licensing fees. | Carol (chat): The closest analogy is probably OpenAssetIO. Sandbox is different than incubating. Eric R: Oh, good point Carol | Michael Min (chat): HTJ2K is open-sourced under Aous Naman? Erik R: That is one of the open implementations - however the spec is widely published. Michael M: Yup! Aous’ link is on that page, under an example implementation | Michael M (chat): DPEL’s ASC StEM2 asset has reference media w/ ProRes/DNxHR, and IMF/HTJ2K that could be used in the comparison | . | .

Eric R + Sam Richards. Sam has a document that spells out some of the requirements. I’ll double check with Sam before sharing out, we have talked about this document in previous meeting. | Have been speaking with some of our video metrics folks to define what kinds of metrics make sense for things we care about in VFX and animation | . | Update on Samsung Developer Conference - David #875 . | David presented at Samsung Dev Conference 10 days ago, in context of APV and ASWF | Had a small but good crowd | Keynote showed how much Samsung is committed to open source in a lot of what they do, in Android for their phones, Tizen for their TVs. Samsung uses open source to gather feedback and build their dev community. It’s not a side effort on commercial development, it’s where the work and the feedback on phone and TV is done. Was impressed by that, and wanted to communicate that to the TAC. I feel that Samsung joining as a Premier member is great, but it’s also good that they have a culture of open source. I also think their open source culture we may have things to learn from Samsung. | JT (Chat) Keynote is available to watch | . | Dev Days Recap #873 . | Slide Deck | Carol: have had meetings to wrap up and gather feedback, presenting deck to consolidate feedback | Goals for 2024 Dev Days . | Increase the engineering contributions to our hosted projects | Help our hosted projects be better structured to be able to bring new contributors into their projects | . | Dev Days by the Numbers . | 7 projects participated (was 5) | 47 individuals participating | 56 total PRs opened to contribute back to the projects . | 35 of these are merged as of 10/12/2024 | 18 for MaterialX | 1 for ORI | 2 for OSL | 6 for OCIO | … | . | . | 2023 vs 2024 . | Projects participating: 5 - 7 | Individuals participating: ? - 47 . | Number of unique people who submitted a PR | Larry: projects had other people who participated but may not got to the point of submitting a PR | Project leads: please provide any additional stats on participation | . | PRs opened : 31 - 58 | . | Feedback from Projects Leads . | Collated on Google Doc | . | Key takeaways . | Thumbs up: . | More engineers participated, more PRs opened | We built more templates to reuse | We are creating a funnel | . | Could be better . | Blind to the list: Dev Days management could not see list of participants due to privacy requirements | . | Overall . | Dev Days will not single handedly resolve our engineering contribution goals, but it will participate in solving it | . | . | Changes for the future . | For sure . | Have registrants agree (click a box) to share their Dev Days reg information with Dev Days management | . | In discussion . | Dev Days moving to a quarterly basis . | On a more regular cadence, helps with goals of project standards, having docs up to date, good first issues | Also helps participants, if they can’t participate, they don’t have to wait to the following year | Learn how to do your first contribution on a project | . | If annual event, move Dev Days to the spring . | In case we get negative feedback about quarterly cadence | . | . | Larry: Organizers have had post mortem, and also from projects. But would like to hear back from leads at companies who had multiple people participating. Did you get what you expected to get out of the event? . | Ben: I have an open PR myself on OpenImageIO, spent the days across Pacific and London time helping my team try to understand what this open source contribution thing is, not realizing that not everybody knew what it is. For us a way to show how to participate generally, which we want to do more of. Was spending my time explaining to engineers why would we even do this. Some devs hadn’t contributed to open source before. Feedback is very positive, they could understand why, but were not used to it. Yes yes please quarterly, especially OIIO had great example, a more experienced engineer was able to get at least one PR in. But for some of our juniors may have needed to explain what / why / how earlier. We will use Dev Days as a way to get people participating. Larry: you know nothing stops you any day of the year! But there’s “economy of scale” with these events. Ben: there was a list of issues which was great, with a very large issue broken down into subsections, made it easy to see what could be “bite sized chunks”, that was useful as well. Could be done in other projects. | Alexander S / Eric R (chat) . | Alexander: alternatively extend devdays to two full weeks? | Eric: There was some feeling from our AL participants that a longer “Dev Days” might help with the time zone differences. | Larry: A longer span in which to embed your day, or projects that take multiple days to complete? | Eric: I think a longer span - though I’ll reach out for some clarification | Carol: Longer time frames might tend to be a large burden on the project… the level of support and response time we we expect from projects during dev days is higher than “normal” | Eric: That’d be my concern as well | Alexander: though doing devdays more often might be even more overhead with more context switching? | Carol: it’s a trade off for sure. But the theory would be that it would be less setup for the projects, more just being available for support… Eventually. Obviously we would have work to get there | . | John: some disconnect between issues / complexity / where engineers came in (from meeting). Some issues may have looked tractable at first but more complicated later. | John: “always prepping for dev days” may sound like a lot of work, but positions project to always be ready for new contributors, build this into the project processs. So makes an argument for quarterly. | Eric R: could we try a semi annual, or would that be too long? Larry: we could do a quarterly “welcome new contributors” that’s low key, pick one of those every year to do more publicity. Make sure that build docs are up to date, keep primed all the time. John: you also don’t have to participate, if an event falls during a major release cycle. Larry: lowers the temp on all participants if they feel that missing a day doesn’t mean having to wait a full year | . | John: what’s the general position of the TAC on annual vs quarterly? Or is there a preference . | Ben: definitely quarterly. Also be able to deal with participants in other timezones. 48h on Pacific time (or any timezone) would be great, but maybe 72h? Next time I will prepare our team better. | Larry: we all wish we had done better! | Carol: also want to hear from company representatives, if Dev Days fall on a bad date for a company, will limit ability to participate. Conflicts with production projects, conferences, project releases… Can be different for companies to organize around quarterly, hoping that it’s positive on that side. | John: any objections on quarterly? . | Eric R (Chat): I’ll reach out within our org and get a feel for where people are on the quarterly thing | Alexander S (chat: not sure about quarterly, do we have similar examples from other organizations? | . | John: will also try to streamline the process | Gordon: do we have a measure of what the setup cost is that we expect teams to repeat quarterly? Carol: we don’t have a measure, the hope is that the “startup cost” gets lower over time as we get used to doing it quarterly. A project should always be prepped for new contributors to come in and be well supported, but pick a few days a quarter for higher support / quicker PR review. Also maybe have themes. | Larry: nobody is to take all the work that we did annually and do the same amount quarterly. Would do lower overhead / smaller thing more frequently than the one high stakes thing that requires a lot of work. Should be same amount of work total but spread over time and less frantic criticality on a single day. | Larry: nothing would compel any project or company to do it every quarter. | JT (chat): Timeboxing Code Sprints These are two principles/guides the Pasadena/SCB group follows and has found successful. Also note the “Criticism” section below the Code sprints section | . | John: team will come back with quarterly plan, thank you Carol and Larry for making this possible, project leads also. Good to see charts with growing numbers! | . | . | Evolving our working groups program #798 . | Initially WGs were supposed to be time limited . | Assets and Review and Approval transitioned to projects | CI and D&amp;I are ongoing | Interop in R&amp;D mode | . | 3 types of WGs . | Time / deliverable limited | Starts developing IP to eventually become a project | Special Interest | . | Larry: want to support WGs that have changed over time. But also feeling that TAC reporting, annual review, deliverables on schedule may be too high a threshold for a group that just wants a Zoom meeting and a chat room. We don’t want to feel like giving those resources should require a lot of work. Can use imagination as to where WGs could fit into. | Larry: not a value judgement, a right sizing of threshold and resourcing. John: and setting expectations. | Carol: might help to give a couple of examples. What groups would you imagine don’t have to do an annual review? | Larry: CI WG is a project (in my mind), it’s been acting like a project, has repo, code, people are depending on it. Has no time horizon, no end deliverable. On the low end, people have talked about the Interop WG, maybe some day they will produce an artefact / code repo and need full structure, but for now it’s more like a SIG. D&amp;I is a real working group, it’s not a project since it’s not producing group, but it’s not a SIG. It runs programs for the ASWF, represents us publicly… That’s a “real” WG without a time horizon. | Carol: so we’re talking about changing our definitions for Working Groups. Larry: there’s room for WGs that are taking on an ongoing task that doesn’t have an end date. | John: could be a 4th category we call a “program”. A lot of foundations do that for efforts they have invested in, they have called it a “program”. | Michael M: sounds like considering expanding the WG definition, doesn’t seem mutually exclusive. Expand the definition and create SIGs. Larry: yes, reason for moving things into projects because of the legal structure put in place by LF, legal protection for projects producing artifacts. Feels like a different category. MM: AOUSD has WGs that are essentially Project Groups | Gordon: drawing a line between the WGs and projects makes a lot of sense, can you help me understand difference between WG and a SIG? Maybe it doesn’t save us a lot, we may still want to review and approve these things, is the lack of an end date the only difference? John: what spurred this conversation is when a WG came to be, was supposed to deliver something and then shut down, but some WGs aren’t like that. So should it be looked at differently. Separate annual reviews as a secondary concept, we want to set expectations. | JC (chat): Kubernetes SIG vs WG basically?) | Gordon: could we solve this by just saying “it’s OK if you don’t end”. Larry: WGs and Projects are understood to have an annual review, they are giving a full TAC session to do a formal presentation to the TAC, report on what they’ve done. That limits the number of WGs we can have since we run out of TAC time. Sometimes there’s not a lot for the WG to say in that format about what they have accomplished, if what they are mostly about is providing a forum for interchange. Gordon: maybe separation would be “low overhead / little oversight”, just vote on? Larry: TAC could disband a group if not active anymore. Gordon: update doesn’t have to be full TAC session, could be 5 minutes. We could make it lighter weight. John: don’t think you want to add too much variance to the process. As a group evolves, could make sense to evolve between models. Emily: also think about what the scope is, and where a WG is in their life cycle. Love the idea of making D&amp;I into a program, maybe they could even get a voting seat at the TAC. When I think about SIGs, I think about a sandbox. Lots of people have expressed interest in AI, we could spin up a SIG on that topic, which could turn into something bigger later on. | John: a good way to think about it. Adoption metrics are one thing, would be good to get alignment on whether we want to bifurcate our definition our WGs. WG CI is clear candidate for moving over. USD could be argued fits in the SIG model, but there’s also some development and assets. | JT (Chat): Hasn’t the TAC already talked about written/email reports and then TAC meeting time for questions as a time saving approach? | John: how would the TAC deal with all these? Carol: not a fan of creating more things for the sake of creating more things, decide whether we need them. We can create processes once we decide to do something, but not clear why we are doing this. Gordon: take 4 heads, decide what are the differences, can we handle with simpler structures. There’s mental load on dealing with multiple structures, we don’t want to debate a program vs a WG. | Eric R: see this as a way to authorize creating a channel in Slack (Stephen Mackenzie: spk). So that’s a way to create a place to collaborate which is in the “realm of stuff we all do”. | . | . ",

We broke discussion down into identity tokens and access tokens. You probably want to limit functionality of access tokens. Identity management seems more likely to want to be used across plug-ins / applications. Can we do this in a way where there’s an agent that manages it, or a central keystore. Want to avoid having users authenticating multiple times. Concept of a “driver’s license”. | . | Areas the project could use help on . | Outreach to ASWF contributors | Vendors to help with best practices and review | Put working group in ASWF Landscape | Collaboration with other security efforts at Linux Foundation | . | Questions . | Eric E: where does this touch other ASWF projects? RV? . | Jim: OpenAssetIO will make connections to metadata and asset management systems. Chris: also OTIO in the demo we did. Larry: also OpenCue | . | Eric R: OTIO and USD have concept of asset resolvers, have to query a database to find asset. Daryll: we expect this to keep getting more important over time. | Larry: how do we broaden our thinking beyond beyond cloud storage. We have 1990s style command line tools that assume direct access to files. | Daryll: in an ideal ZTWG world, you would protect access to internal assets just like on the cloud, but today we still have NFS servers. Chris: Also want to avoid having to login 10 different times to 10 different systems. Jim: want to avoid interfering with creative process. Daryll: eventually a “open file IO” project? | Eric R: at work we have lots of cloud centric pipelines, we have a lot of bridge code to hide the fact that assets are in object storage and pretend it’s in local storage. It’s a good scoping to keep focussed on authorization. Jim: enough scope on security side, but eventually a separate project looking at implementation code could make sense. | Ben (chat): In HPC we would have a fuse like filesystem that used the local drive as a “L4 to L5” cache. And then leverage PAM and ACLs | . | Meetings bi weekly Thursday 1PM Pacific | John: we have quorum. | A year is fine | . | JF: motion for a year renewal. Larry will second. | Motion carries | . | John: congratulations, let use know how we can help | . | Scott: it has been said that the .io may be going away in the future, that would affect the aswf.io. We may need a contingency plan in future? . | John: we typically purchase multiple domains in advance for that | Larry: would be hard to imagine this would happen without someone standing up a replacement “.io”, but the question is how much more expensive. | . | Ben: Daryll says MovieLabs has no way to share where the meeting is? Chris: I will publicize where the meeting, we originally private but will now be public (original meetings on Teams). | . ",

Larry: if a project breaks compatibility, that could be a big problem. We should have a CI against top of tree for all those projects. Eric R: can have a sample composition that exercise everything, and do a visual diff. Joshua: a test app could be called “Canary”! Larry (chat): People interested in the Canary project, let’s meet to talk about it in the CI working group. I think we can cobble together something in short order. | Eric R: name inspired by OIIO name. Larry: Jeremy Selan named OCIO, second project named this way! | David: is the Toucan project ready for a blog post / announcement? Eric: at some point we own this as a reference renderer, if we escalate it to a certain point, and mismatch between Toucan and a commercial app, we’ve shied away from this. So not sure we want to go “big” on an announcement? Joshua: we can ask Darby if he’s ready for that. We’re starting on that road, Darby has also made tlRender which is GPU accelerated, it’s already in cineSync Play, OpenRV can also render OTIO. But we’re not announcing it as the “reference”. | Carol: you’ve moved your adapters into their own repos, thinking about other apps in OCIO ecosystem like our CLI apps, ocio view. How do you handle that from a TSC perspective, are there separate maintainers? Joshua: work on migrating the commercial adapters, first step of separating took way longer than we expected. Next step of who is maintaining them, some clear / obvious choices for those under active development like AAF adapter (someone from Avid, Animal Logic). Rest is based on “who shows up”, some are file formats that aren’t owned by anyone like CMX EDL. We may drop some over time. Eric: some federated repos are not maintained at this moment which is a bit problematic. No official process around who maintains those. | Nick (chat): OTIO has versioned schemas, including an upgrade and downgrade too | Plugin Template Repo | CPP example | Will vote on renewal in LFX voting | . | Evolving our working groups program #798 . | John: Discussion a few weeks ago, where are the action items? | Larry: was starting to seem too complicated, OK to have WGs without a time horizon, but still things we want to elevate to project status | Idea of having separate SIGs and WGs was too complicated, didn’t want to have big debates on the boundary between the two | John: action would be about the CI WG and Interop as a project | Larry: loosen up the definition of WG in the charter. D&amp;I is not just a WG of people talking, they are doing work representing the foundation, they have budget to spend, they don’t have an end date. Very different with WGs with an end date / task. So WGs are a “scale” | John: we can take this offline, will look at the language. Larry: may be minor edit. | Alexander Schwank: what about USD? John: may stay as WG, but some subprojects may have IP they are developing? Larry: is there a threshold of how much code / artifacts a WG can create? Interop group may work on some code for a while, but eventually deliver code to projects. Can we keep the option of staying as a WG? John: more a question for downstream consumers, are we depending on this code in a way that it needs to be from a project, or does it not matter? For Rust WG, they had gotten to the point they would need to develop tools to build bindings, but they wanted to align IP of bindings to upstream project. Question is what label you want to give it. | Scott: Interop WG has 3 outputs: code belongs to the projects, if a project doesn’t want to take ownership of the code, then maybe we can be the unofficial bindings for the project. Also tools that support the first set of bindings. And any kind of documentation. Most devs know how to write Python bindings, but can document how to write Python bindings for C++. Also dos and don’ts of writing Swift bindings, Rust bindings. | John: will work on closing this one out. | Nick: interested in the USD WG and our many sub WGs, some are long term, some are short term. Am I understanding that USD WG would lack a vote in this rote, but some some WGs could be promoted to incubation project which could eventually be promoted to adopted projects with voting rights? Seems to “invert the hierarchy”. Larry: is this an argument to make the USD WG to make it an incubation project? Other projects have multiple repos run by the same TSC. OpenEXR does that with iMath, OCIO. I suspect this will be expanding. So if USD WG fits that mold? Multiple projects run by a same TSC? Nick: that sounds like a possible path to a resolution, more active participation by us in this body, which would be appreciated by myself and Alex. John: WG is an earlier collaboration, earlier than sandbox. “We know something should exist, but need to get people to the same table”. USD WG could take that same path, could also take a path that separate parts could become project. There are a lot of different paths, now that USD WG is a real thing with deliverables and assets, now it may become a full project. Nick: was trying to map what we have against the structure we are proposing. Larry: if you want to elevate yourself to a project, you may need a mission statement separate from OpenUSD? Nick: want to be focussed on M&amp;E and interests of this group, distinguished from USD which has broader focus. This is an important venue for a community that should have an equal voice in an equal forum instead of “a” voice in a much larger forum. That’s how I distinguish it in my mind. | David: would USD WG have a repo of artifacts specific to M&amp;E industry, under custody of the WG / project? Nick: John helped us set that up, have a hierarchy of repos under a GitHub org. John: there are some repos under there, including the assets which is probably the most used. Nick: the assets looks the most like a project of its own, work that they engage with Metaverse Standard and Khronos projects. Seems to have joined group of what looks like projects rather than WGs. John: Camera WG may also have some code deliverables? Overall goal is to have a voice for this community in the TAC, and with different work streams, what makes long term sense to organize them. | Carol: when talking about who gets a vote, D&amp;I group should get a vote. An additional factor to think about. | . | TAC Vice Chair . | Larry looking for a vice chair for next year | Larry: is there a deadline for this? John: would be good to get closure on next TAC meeting in 4 weeks. | David: Thank you Kimball for having been TAC Chair for many year, and thank you Larry for vice chair and now leading. Want to welcome anyone who wants to step up to vice chair. Looking forward to continue working with Larry! | . | . ",

    "content": ". | D&amp;I annual review moved to next year due to schedule conflict | OpenQMC . | Eric E: general assignment on approval to OpenQMC code base at it stands, but needs high level approval | Basic patents have expired / about to expire, some later patents are more niche / less relevant | . | OpenAPV . | John: Eric / Sam looking at deliverables for 6 month deliverable | Eric R: scoping of evaluation criteria, project is working on creating ffmpeg branch for integration, on which we can run test suite. Will start doing TSC meetings early next year, Sam and I will participate | Youngkwon: working on the draft document, ready to work on technical details. We understand most important part is the ffmpeg plugin, working on testing, should be available early next year. Will start TSC meetings so we can start documentation and details of process to complete eval documents. | . | LFX Insights review for projects . | John: original didn’t seem to produce accurate stats, getting better now, as well as a facelift. | Improvements on data quality, removing duplicate profiles. Could use help from projects to look at the data and state whether it is right or not. Also are the charts showing relevant data to projects. Sometimes disconnect between how a chart is set up and what it means. Would be great if project leads could poke around in there, spot any obvious duplicates. | There will be work on the tool in Q1, and bring Insights team to the TAC in Q2, present what’s coming up. | David: was at LF Member Summit recently, meeting of exec directors of LF foundations, LFX folks presented upgrades to the platform. Was then said “you will need to present to ASWF since they are one of your toughest critics!”. Ahead of this meeting, would be good to provide actionable feedback. We are the litmus test! | John: if there are helpful charts that could be added that’s good as well. But don’t pay attention to “best practices score” right now. | Eric R: in OTIO we have our own GH org, handful of repos that have different support models, is this reflected? John: we can add an org or individual repos, DPEL has similar issues. That will be fixed. OpenEXR also has multiple repos under a project. | JC: how should we provide feedback? In the past I have created tickets, is that the right place, or should we provide the feedback in one place? | John: could be dropped onto existing ticket? Some we could fix, some could be escalated? Issue #920 in TAC repo. | . | TAC Chair / Vice Chair for 2025 . | John: Larry was voted as first vice chair, getting ready for first “rotation”. Larry will step in from vice chair to chair role. Carol has come forward with interest in vice chair, no one else has stepped up, anyone else? | Kimball will still be part of the TAC, thank you for all your work and leadership! | Kimball: this is a great community, not so much “leadership” as much as trying to help as much as possible. We have more to do! | David: thank you Kimball! | John: we will take vote offline since we don’t have quorum of voting members (12 present / 13 missing) | . | Evolving our working groups program . | CI WG likely a project level | Language Interop: TAC can decide on that | Lack of representation on TAC from WGs . | We have concept of long term WG, so you get to “stick around” | Could those have a TAC rep? | . | JF: what about WGs vs non-graduated projects? | Michael M: when we formed first WG, there was a concept of TAC sponsorship. Currently no process to make sure that TAC sponsor is still around. What does it mean to be a “semi permanent” WG, for instance Cory has been sponsor of USD WG. | Larry: there’s a special TAC vote to elevate WG to voting status, that should be doled out judiciously. Not all WG have the purpose / needs. Canonical example that should have is the D&amp;I WG, they are long term, doing important work, and doing public work on behalf of ASWF. They really should have a say in the direction. Whereas more “usual” WG that isn’t as big as a project may not need to have that representation. “Safety valve” to avoid a project that’s been going on for years that still does have vote vs WG. | Cory: if a WG is elevated to a project, it should have a TAC rep with a vote. | John: we can chose a better name than “long term WG” which is a bit of a mouthful, but concept would still be the same. USD calls them SIGs. | Eric E: can we let a WG run longer than a year without a TAC rep? We don’t want to force ending the work, even if there’s no need for a TAC rep? John: “may opt to” leaves leeway for TAC to get a second year. | John: does that seem like an acceptable way to handle that? Larry: as long as the TAC can make those decisions, decouple the second year vs TAC rep decisions. | John: will do a language change in the WG definition, will try to put pieces in place and TAC can react and approve. | Larry: an inventory of our usual criteria, is it just a small checklist, or would need to do a lot of work? Don’t want to shove a bunch of additional work at WGs, maybe not every is ready to have extra work added to their plate. CI is a strong contender of what this is meant to address, they have been running for a long time and we don’t want them to stop. | . | Anyone can participate in the upcoming security evals, reach out to Cary or (?) | OpenVDB review January 8th (Ken) . | John: please keep us posted if that’s going to work | . | David: we’re considering if we should have more presence at SIGGRAPH Asia next year, so looking for any feedback if someone attended. Sounds like a good opportunity to go someplace we’re not as well known, but maybe other opportunities. Have it in the 2025 budget, that or any other candidates in that part of the world. | Larry: renewed appreciation of people like Kimball joining from “challenging” timezones. Not sure what to do about that long term. Middle of the day Pacific time is earliest possible for Pacific, and earliest for Europe. Not sure how to make it easier for people in those locations. John: challenge in a lot of our larger projects. Solution is mostly alternative timeslots, but no great solution. Larry: may only be a lateral step from “some people can never make it” to “half the people can only make it half of the time”. | David: pitch for our swag store, there’s a section for the Holidays, can put our favorite design on a Santa Hat for instance. | David: deep thank you for working on all of our projects, in a way that didn’t exist 6 years ago. Thank you! | Larry: is there a final time picked for Open Source Forum, time and format? . | David: putting final touches on that, discussion with venue tomorrow so everything is still to be confirmed, but likely to be Feb 13th at Walt Disney Animation studios, Nick Cannon agreed to host us. Changing the forum format, moving away from renting expensive locations to go to our members, more a round table discussion rather than a series of presentations to make it different from Open Source Days. For members only this time, we will have a web site which will be visible, but if someone wants to come, they will need to ask, and we’ll vet presentation, so all member companies (at all levels), and open to “friends of the foundation”, anyone who has participated, and anyone potential members who would like to “check us out”. Working the theme for the forum, “open source in the context of production pipelines that are changing with new technologies coming ahead” (so AI for instance), how will production pipelines change, and what are the places where open source projects can play a bigger role, and what parts of the pipeline could become open source. | Kimball: the “Hype Pipe” is going to be a real topic, how to make real tools out of the AI tools. There are some really good tools in there, our studio is making some of them. Not on the image generation bandwagon, not sure that’s useful for “premier” content. | David: with all the hype about AI, should have seen some of the more generic tools generated with AI to help in production pipelines for at least simple things like automated dust busting / wire removal / uprezing. Have you seen some of those tools in your companies? | Kimball: of course. Also looking at whether we can help TDs write small Python snippets, but not producing pixels. David: as “flag bearer” for open source, any tech disruption is opportunity for open source to take part in the pipeline. What could be an opportunity for open source, is going to talk about that at a Forum possible? Kimball: have been talking about this for 18 months, for instance at Open Source Days. For open source opportunities for ASWF, we can help people gain confidence in rights management, maybe have a project for that. How do the weights of a model trained for a show stay with that show, help people navigate those waters. We can help people gain confidence in small tools. | Scott (Chat): I feel like we have to be very careful about how AI is being used and advertised. Right now it is a very dirty word in some circles, and I can see how people can see this go against the D&amp;I initiative. | Kimball: the “AI” word is the source of the hype. People are ascribing unreasonable expectations. | David: in our industry we have extra careful attitude, especially after the strikes. Kimball: provide tools around rights management so people are confident their images are managed in a careful way. Not sure how that looks like exactly. David: would like the forum to be a place to discuss this, come out with an outcome that would allow us to go a bit deeper into issues such as provenance. Other foundations in LF is doing such work (C2PA), some of our members (Adobe) have endorsed C2PA, maybe we could bring education and tools. We could have a short term WG come out of the discussions at the forum. | Feb 13 coming fast, we’ll probe some of you to do anchor presentations, would like forum in 2 segments, one with short presentations to anchor the topic, and second section being interactive discussion with membership. | Scott (chat): I think if a project were to come in and say “We are an AI project”, I think a key evaluation is looking at where the dataset came from and how this’ll affect users of the software (and those it may displace). For example, if someone open sources a wire removal tool and it removes all of the wire removal jobs, then do we want to associate ourselves to that/how do we want to associate ourselves to that? | Michael: any conversations about content credentials between Adobe and legal team? Don’t know what work may have been done. David: there was a great presentation from Adobe, they have plugins for hosting AI models, including your own, and how you can subscribe to C2PA foundation. Not aware of direct discussions between LF legal in context of ASWF. C2PA working on spec to articular provenance. The answer about provenance from LF is to look at C2PA. It’s not a fix all solution, but it’s a good place to look for people addressing the issue. We could bring that to our forum. | John: we could also ask them to present at TAC meeting, also any other LF project that could be relevant, we are happy to coordinate between projects when useful. | David: at LF summit, there was a presentation about Open Source AI definitions, was a controversial topic. Not sure if these are recorded, lots of “passion” in Open Source world. Not sure we want to get into nitty gritty of AI (open source or not), but want to make sure our production pipelines evolve new open source opportunities. | “Here” with Tom Hanks used AI tools for some of the de-aging. | . | .

It’s reasonably good. It’s a little bit verbose. There is an AI tool. That is that you can turn on as well. Larry: I think the couple of projects would like to use it, it would be better than the very sketchy notes we have now. Caril: I’ve used the Zoom transcription in the past, it does OK. John: If you’re interested in experimenting with it, we can follow up with the Lfx team, because I think we’re turning it on for a few projects. | Alexander Schwank (chat): USDWG is happy to be guinea pig for AI meeting notes | Michael Johnson (chat): I think DPEL would like to use the meeting notes stuff | . | Security thread model analysis for ASWF projects . | John: if you are interested in listening in to MaterialX and/or OpenEXR, Jonathan and Cary are your contacts. | . | Evolving our working groups program . | John: we put in a PR before the holidays, asked the group to review it. Any concerns in merging this PR? In encompasses what we talked about. We will vote offline to merge. | . | D&amp;I Working Group Annual Review . | Slide Deck | Rachel Rose and Carol Payne | Mission Statement: “The goal of the Diversity &amp; Inclusion Working Group at the Academy Software Foundation is to break down barriers to access and increase connection among participants in the Foundation’s projects, the larger community, and the VFX &amp; Animation industry. The working group brings together software engineers/developers, marketing/communication professionals, students &amp; educators, and anyone else passionate about Diversity &amp; Inclusion.” | D&amp;I Working Group Focus Areas . | Increase ASWF Diversity &amp; Representation: ensure there is diverse leadership and membership across the Academy Software Foundation and its projects | External Outreach &amp; Education: encourage high school and college students to pursue technical careers in the motion picture and media industries and provide them with opportunities to participate in open source projects and learn from experienced software engineers. | Member Guidance: Provide guidance and resources for Foundation members to educate their colleagues on open source and D&amp;I topics. | . | For today’s update… . | What did we do? | How did we do? | What are our plans? | What input do you have? | . | ASWF D&amp;W Working Group 2024 Plans . | Planning lunch for 2025 priorities happening in a couple of weeks, so won’t be presenting 2025 plans yet. | Plans for 2024 from December 2023 . | What was accomplished vs what was not. Some of the goals haven’t been achieved yet. | We will concentrate on what we achieved in 2024 | . | . | ASWF D&amp;I Framework . | Action: Guidance for Members . | Explore whether providing an open source framework for DEI compiled form the best ideas of our member companies could be beneficial to our community. How can we help other companies large or small jump start their DEI programs. | . | In Progress: . | Short Term Goal: Publish a D&amp;I resource list as well as case studies regarding existing DEI initiatives. Pages across the internet into a curated list. A lot of progress on collecting resource list, next step is to come up with good way to present and organize list. | Planning: Source information and spec out what a fully open source Framework could look like. An ongoing process. | . | Getting Involved! . | Join us in the #dei-open-framework channel in the ASWF Slack! | Meetings: continuing monthly in 2025, starting back up soon | . | . | ASWF TAC Diversity . | Action Increase ASWF Diversity &amp; Representation . | Won’t do a deep dive today | The ASWF is pushing to affect the issue of diversity and inclusion within VFX, animation, open source, and the ASWF. | We made a push to influence the makeup of the Governing Board. How do we do the same for the TAC over time to also reflect this important focus? TAC is very different than the Governing Board, so won’t be the same, a different entity with different goals. | Pipeline: our communities could be more diverse. For TAC, TSC reps? | Appointees: need ways to encourage diversity in appointees. | Making Space: how can we make space for more great leaders? Governing Board adopted term limits, alternates, and language on how to select and appoint representatives from member companies. Spent a lot of time talking in D&amp;I WG, will schedule discussion with the TAC. | . | . | Summer Learning Program . | Summer 2024: . | Open “Focus” year | 20 learners | Industry webinars | Structured Group Learning Time | Combo of FXPhD &amp; Udeny | Had over 100 applicants, picked 20. Ended up with stellar group -Big Wins | Continue success from organizational transition of 2023 | Prioritized Speaker Series, which made sense at that point in the program. Diverse speakers with great stories to tell. | Great, active cohort, active on Slack. Enjoyed being a mentor | . | Improvement Opportunities . | Need to grow mentor pool to facilitate better matching, better experience if we can one-to-one match mentor to learner. Better if we can better match areas of interest. If you sign up for a mentor, you might not be a mentor for that year if interests don’t match up. | Need to standardize long-term, operational support from greater ASWF | Was challenging to grow to 20 learners, had to reach out to individuals to as to be a mentor. If we want to accept more, we have to be prepared to scale so learners have as good an experience. | Need to improve guest mentorship program | Did work last summer: . | Swag store gift cards to send to learners, a lot less work than sending individual swag boxes | Standardize application forms | . | . | The program is working | Internship placements at Pixar, Disney Animation, Bolt Graphics | Job placements at Dreamworks, Google, Epic Games, Jellyfish Animation, Sony Interactive Entertainment, and more | Many learners continuing higher education in technical / entertainment focused areas of study | See blog post | Reached out to previous year to gather data | We are in the 5th year of the program | Thinking about sustainability / growth, how can we better integrate it to ASWF rather than just D&amp;I WG, we don’t have direct answer but a couple of ideas | Similar to what we did with Dev Days, started off in D&amp;I, but moved to TAC initiative. Not necessarily a TAC initiative, but should have same involvement as Dev Days | . | Organizational Opportunities . | Leadership transition . | Founded in 2020 by Carol and Rachel, initially thought it was a 2 year commitment. We still love doing it, but in the spirit of diversity, want to get new people involved. | Rachel will step back in the spring, still be involved, but rotate someone in. | Eventually Carol will do the same | . | Strengthen SLP . | Currently at 20 learners, what would it take to be at 30? | Thinking of it as a larger ASWF level program | . | Form bridge between D&amp;I and Outreach group . | Started out with very strong relationship, has gotten a bit quieter | Lots of aspects span the two group | . | Partner with AOUSD DEI Group . | Discussions on accessibility | . | . | Up Next: Initiatives . | Planning in next two weeks, a lot of carry over from2024 | SLP 2025 | D&amp;I Framework Initiative . | A complicated, large project | . | TAC Diversity Initiative | International Science Fair Discovery . | Wanted to get involved for a long time | Discovery work by Cary Philips a couple of years ago | Reach to High School students | Requires someone to start / lead initiative . | Someone new who is not Carol / Rachel | . | Would like to make progress in 2025 | May be working with Outreach group | . | . | TAC Feedback . | Are we focussed in the correct areas? | Where could we help your projects succeed? | Please encourage participation from your company! . | Companies believe in this, have internal groups, we would like to collaborate | We have phases of more or less volunteers . | We have new faces now that are really | . | . | Scott (chat): As an SLP mentor for the past few years: This has been a great experience. I highly recommend that if you are interested, then to volunteer. I think that D&amp;I WG is probably one of the most important groups at the ASWF because it is a great resource to bring in new people to push the projects. And I want to thank Carol, Rachel, and all of the D&amp;I volunteers for everything you’ve done. | Larry: what are your thoughts on D&amp;I efforts via Dev Days? Not a D&amp;I initiative per se, but lots of overlap in goals. How do they help each other? Rachel: Dev Days is about bringing in new people, which increases diversity. When looking at SLP applications, how do we advertise in the right place to get selection of people who wouldn’t normally apply. Would like to think about how this could look like for Dev Days. A bit different since we reach out to member companies, but how do we encourage diverse participation for all definitions of diversity. Larry: how does Dev Days pull people in, it’s awesome that SLP results in internships / placements, maybe think of Dev Days as the next step after SLP. Carol: we’ve don’e that, there have been a handful of previous SLP participants who have taken part in Dev Days. Goals are different, SLP is just intro to industry, no strings attached, different from Dev Days. But Outreach and D&amp;I can tie in with Dev Days. Also want to get more people into Dev Days, relationships with colleges and universities. | David: want to echo what Scott wrote in chat, thank you for all your are doing and your initiatives. What you are doing is very important, we want to continue to encourage it. What you are proposing makes a lot of sense to me, in particular elevating the SLP into a ASWF event makes a lot of sense. | John: this has been impressive work. Some of the strongest D&amp;I work we’ve seen across Linux Foundation. Larry: are other foundations having similar initiatives and finding success? Sometimes feels like we’re making guesses, is there a track record of something we should be copying / borrowing? John: “demonstratively works” can be subjective, hard to gauge the impact of “someone who got into the industry who wouldn’t have otherwise”. Initiatives that have had a lot of staying power, we’ve seen in CNCF. What we often see is a lot of enthusiasm around such an initiative, get people around a table, but eventually fizzles out. People put a lot of work in, but end up burning out. To us a good gauge is staying power. We’ve made a few connections with other projects doing D&amp;I work, everyone is asking the same questions / doing similar things, can be helpful to help with networking of “leaders”. Carol / Rachel, don’t know if any of this would be helpful? Carol: we will always listen to other people and would like to talk to people doing the same work we are doing. We want to partner with AOUSD, that’s important to us, since there’s a lot of great D&amp;I work out there, we try to keep our work scoped to ASWF / M&amp;E industry, focussed on what we know. Can make interacting with other groups difficult. But some things such as mentorship programs can be good to learn. But can be hard to collaborate on specific projects, but we will share with AOUSD, share the same set of goals. We already have that connection and look forward to growing it. Rachel: we spend a lot of time talking to people not part of ASWF, leaning on LF to find more of those connections would be great. I feel that the organization is willing to put resources behind. Some times we have a hard time figuring out how to use those resources! | John: Open Source Summit NA CFP - highlighting the D&amp;I track | David: attended LF member summit in the fall, conference that takes place every year where only the members of the LF attend. Topics are on deeper open source, lots of Open Source Program Office topics, but there’s D&amp;I undercurrent to a lot of presentations. Could be a great place for D&amp;I to present next year, or attend, you would find a lot of kindred spirits. You have a lot you have done that’s original to present, there would be an audience for that. Would be a way to connect with other foundations, you could build your own connections with other foundations. We can take that offline to present to LF Member Summit. John: Open Source Summit has entire D&amp;I track, could be good to build networking for you. | . | . | Eric E: should we talk about Open Source Forum? . | David: yes. Prepping for Open Source Forum on Feb 13. We have a schedule. Forum is for our members and to “friends of the Foundation / would be members”. Building program as we speak. I think I presented here the anatomy of a studio slide? If I haven’t I will present it now. Hosted by Nick Cannon at Walt Disney Animation Studios, in discussion with Nick we were talking about if there was a graph representing a production pipeline in large VFX / Animation studios. If you know of such a chart, please let me know. Nick sent some notes, prepared a slide, represents different parts of a studio pipeline. Will build heat map with where our projects fit in this map, and where will the impact be of new technologies on the production pipeline. AI is one of the obvious technologies, which steps of the pipeline will be affected by it. Talking to different folks who have expertise in the area, present pipeline as it is today, and have an interactive session at the end where we will discuss how our projects and open source can come into the pipeline. NVIDIA has been heavily involved with this transition, may have presenters from NVIDIA to put the short presentation for AI opportunity. | Emily: Registration is already open, since we’re keeping it to foundation, we will be sending registration codes later this week. | Eric E: in terms of NVIDIA contributions, looking at how NVIDIA can help. 2 possible directions: think about existing open source / adjacent projects, recent work in neural texture compression and neural materials, where they’ve used sort of a combination of a differentiable shading language called slang, PyTorch and OptiX, some of that work is open source, or is going to be open source soon. And then what are the more forward looking GenAI applications, creating 3D models, animations… We could do a survey of existing projects, most of which are early days, not something you will use in a studio tomorrow. Let me know what’s useful, we don’t have to do it at Open Source Forum, we could do a TAC presentation. | Eric R: we tend to be focussed on VFX and Animation, but live action now starting to have pipelines, assistant editors are operating as ATDs. At Netflix we have something that looks a lot like what a animation / vfx pipeline might look like. David: first draft is coming from Animation / VFX, but we want to expand into live action. It’s a good time to look at large studio pipelines and do this mapping, and looking at animation / vfx practices sleeping into live action. Also where are the opportunities for new open source projects, where our current and new members can work together. | Larry: how would you like feedback on this diagram? Should they comment on the document? | David: Document Link is editable Please look at it, you can even try to modify it and we can always go back in versions. Please send your feedback to me, and I will share it back. Larry: having everyone edit it may be chaos, but can just comment and have edits performed by David. David: all comments welcome, want to have a generic representation of a pipeline, not tied to a specific studio. Where are the opportunities for our projects in the future. | Eric E: was talking to live action editor, in the edit room, they would sometimes reframe, push in, sometimes retime, use frame interpolation, tighten up dialog. It’s a “slippery slope”. Carol: it’s also true in the color world, expanding color decision making to other parts of the pipeline. | David: will follow up on TAC list with more structured process to review this slide | . | .

    "content": ". | Upcoming reviews: MaterialX and raw2aces . | Jonathan: we can be review for MaterialX. Would folks scheduled for today prefer that slot? Carol: got rescheduled for layer. Larry: it feels like we just did it? Doesn’t have a to be a big update, but you had a big release, seems worth updating. Jonathan: yes, we’ll update. | Raw2aces: need to connect with Alex Forsythe. Larry / Carol: yes, month of Feb is going to be final push on ACES2 for OCIO integration, but we may want to target something a bit later. John: we have gaps. | . | OpenQMC #434 . | Eric: seem to have internal assignment, but working on getting someone “important enough” to sign off. | . | OpenAPV - defining 6 month milestones . | First TSC last week. Eric R: regular cadence of meetings. Have document we put together, we’ve laid the ground work, OpenAPV as a project is going to work on defining milestones. OpenAPV can come up with recommendation and bring back to the TAC. | John: do you want to work with them and put this back on TAC agenda? Eric R: let me check the schedule. Next meeting is Thursday next week, would be reasonable to say by mid February. Can check back in on Feb 19th TAC meeting. | . | Security Threat model analysis for ASWF projects . | John: meetings have started. Jonathan: first meeting with OSTIF group went well, we exchanged ideas. They have posted 3 security advisories in triage mode, are they relevant, how should they be addressed. We haven’t dived into them yet. We also want that people who aren’t ASWF leads can view these issues, in particular some people from Apple are very interested in ASWF project security. John: I pinged Andy Grimberg for GitHub stuff. | Cary: OpenEXR had first meeting last week, described project, where we are, we thing we’re doing the right thing, but “tell us what we don’t know”. Haven’t heard back since, not sure if they are working on OpenEXR and not finding anything? John: they may want to not burden projects too much, they will circle back when they have more to discuss. | Larry: want to bring in people who are contributors but not necessarily just the people who normally get the advisories. That’s a good idea, one complaint on project side leadership is we don’t know what to pay attention to. Outside consultants are not project users, they may have trouble judging what’s relevant, people from Autodesk / Apple may have better idea based on how they integrate the projects, are the alerts something they care about. We should make this a priority. John: don’t want to publicize holes before there is a fix in place. Larry: we can help find people in those companies who are interested in security. John: they don’t want to put out final report before something is deemed fixed or irrelevant. | . | Call out TAC Vice Chair being Governing Board rep alternate . | John: wanted to add more documentation in our processes. #946 | JF: do we need to define who is eligible to be delegated the role of Governing Board representative? Carol: is there something earlier in the document that defines “TAC membership”? John: would have a to be a TAC voting member? Carol: if we add it for GB representative, we should add it for “everything”. | John: Does anyone have an issue with Carol being the “alternative TAC representative to the Governing Board”? No one has. | John: will clarify that you have to be a TAC voting member? Carol: seems to be clear. Larry: we don’t have an escape clause for main representative, just for TAC vice chair. We can change the charter at a later time. Will we need to vote every year to make the vice chair the GB alternate? John: no. Carol: unless vice chair doesn’t want to do it (timezone issues for instance). | . | Carol: early phase of discussion on taking up color metadata in OpenEXR in Color Interop Forum as next topic. So Color Interop Forum is starting up again, we have a meeting next week with this topic. So if you have interest, join next Monday at noon PST. | Emily: Feb 13 is Open Source Forum, registration code will be emailed out today / tomorrow. Matthew: will this be “remote enabled?”. Emily: first half will have remote option, second half (moderated discussion) will only have remote for board members / voting TAC members. That will be sent separately. Matthew: also joint board / tac meeting before? Emily: yes, will post full schedule. Starts at noon for board members, 2PM for actual event. Open Source Forum Announcement . | Rob Rowe: looking to catch up on security stuff? Cary: two projects (OpenEXR, MaterialX) will share back results of audit, but for now there’s now foundation-wide project set up for this. Rob: where can I ask to catch up? Cary: MaterialX may be further along, but can ask Jonathan or myself. Larry: can help to look at badging requirements which calls out need for security audit every few years, so that’s the pilot program of doing a legit “outside group” security audit on two projects, is it a valuable service, this is our “toe in the water” to test the process, and see what real security experts tell us we have to do differently. | .

Jonathan: no major negatives, but the slides at the end is where we would like to work more with other groups, for instance we can’t do render validation on our own. Also we can’t migrate platforms on our own, we’d love to have a discussion about other groups, and see if we can come to a consensus. Emily: looking to set up BlueSky account for ASWF before Open Source Forum. Mastodon will need more work. We don’t have bandwidth to engage with community, right now it’s more used to just push information. How much community engagement can we do effectively? Wave: advantage of Mastodon is that if we put out an announcement, those of us on that can “boost” that. Jonathan: MaterialX is on both platforms, not sure which will “win”, but we’re happy to boost ASWF posts on both platforms. John: sounds like Emily is already on that. OCIO has a WG within their project, so if that’s something that works for MaterialX, we can help / support. Jonathan: already collaborating with OCIO on Nanocolor. Collabs are happening, wanted to highlight how valuable they are. John: every ASWF contribution in LF Insights came from Jonathan, it’s an attribution thing. Once data refreshes his affiliation will reflect. Jonathan: charts give me info that would be hard to gather myself. John: we’ll bring the LFX Insights team back here in a couple of months. | . | . | OpenVDB Annual Review - Ken . | Sparse Volume Tools build on VDB Data Toolbox | Large Toolbox . | Ever growing | Construct volumes and manipulate them | . | List of 3rd party integrations . | Newcomers are DCCs working with 3D Printing and topology optimization | . | Release in 2024 . | Version 12.0.0 October 2024 | Mozilla v2.0 -&gt; Apache v2.0 license (requested by Apple) | A tedious process, people on the TAC were very helpful | Dropped support for GCC9 | No Boost dependency if delayed-loading is disabled . | Hope to completely remove it as some point, but still need it on Windows for delayed loading | . | New API methods for low-level tree manipulations | Major cleanup of NanoVDB to mimic OpenVDB (namespace etc) | Python bindings have been ported from PyBind11 to nanobind . | has better support for GPUs | . | IO streaming of raw NanoVDB buffers (no headers needed) . | Serialization of trees exist in a single memory block | No overhead from passing headers | . | . | OpenVDB wins Sci-Tech Award | Release in 2025 . | Two minor releases per year | One major release per year | Increase cadence | Version 12.x feb 2025 . | SDFs from tapered tubes (think 3D wire-frames) | In-memory half support (requested by Autodesk) | Anisotropic surfacing (elliptic particle footprints) | Support fo latest CLANG (requested by Apple) | Multi-GPU tools in NanoVDB and fVDB (new project) | . | . | fVDB : Spatial-Learning at Scale . | research project I lead at NVIDIA (11 people) | Paper at SIGGRAPH | Neural net architectures come down to a few fundamental operators: CNN, attention | Many existing open source implementations: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jax, limited to 2D data (images) or 1D data (strings), assume data is dense | Want to use operators on the real world, 3 dimensional, very large | Neural Radiance Fields at very large scale, gaussian splats | Reconstructing the world from scanned data | Deep learning on volumetric data is hard . | 3D data is . | Sparse | non-uniform | Too big to fit in RAM | . | . | Want to developer a unified framework for end-to-end deep learning on large 3D Data . | Small academic libraries exist that have some operators. | . | fVDB . | Sparse representation for the features | fVDB is a unified framework for deep-learning on large-scale, high-resolution volumetric data built on top of PyTorch | . | The VDBs : a quick attempt to reduce ambiguity . | VDB is the data structure (2009) | OpenVDB is open source release of VDB (2012) | NanoVDB: GPU friendly version of VDB (2020) | NeuralVDB: neural compression of VDB (paper in 2023), a neural compression technique on top of VDB trees. | fVDB: framework combining… (2024) | . | Unified API for . | Building and training neural networks… | . | Feature Comparison . | Runs on top of CUDA | Memory efficiency | multi-GPU support | . | Core Building Blocks . | JaggedTensor: handling batches of non-uniform data efficiently on the GPU | GridBatch | Accelerated Operators | MultiGPU | . | NanoVDB change to work on neural data: in OpenVDB everything is “mashed together”, data and ijk coordinates.

JF: yes | Erik R: can you talk more about relicensing to Apache 2? In OpenAPV, currently licensed as BSD, curious if that will present similar challenge. Ken: I don’t know why Apple objected to Mozilla 2 license, don’t recall getting a “good” answer. Had something to do with clause on patents? But BSD should be less of an issue. Was extremely painful, everyone who every committed anything to approve, was not easy. Michael Johnson: one license was very straightforward to get through legal to allow commits, the other “not so much”. Ken: no push back once we got project running, just took a long time. A good change in the end. John: if another project wants to do this, reach out to us, we can help guide the project through the process. Larry: OIIO did a license switch from BSD to Apache2 when it joined the foundation, wasn’t too troublesome, everybody we could contact (except one) did it immediately. One person was upset they were contacted at all, an old contribution. Easier for projects where the majority of the code was written by a small group of people you can reach. We had a long tail, but we easily got to 90%. A couple of projects have done it, it is possible, hit us up if you want to do it. | Larry: can you share wisdom with switch to nanobind? Ken: I don’t think I can comment much, it was an ask from inside NVIDIA, change was relatively painless, builds are faster and smaller. Can ask the person who pushed for that to provide more details. But can recommend it, no drawbacks so far. I invited him to the TAC a few months ago. He has slides, I can forward them. Larry: was wondering if experience was overall positive. There was discussion in other TSCs about doing this. There can be friction for projects working together that don’t match. Ken: a winning argument was reading PyBind11 docs which recommend using nanobind. Larry: came up in OpenEXR, author recommended switching as well. | . | . | Motion to review both projects? . | Both projects are renewed | . | . ",

    "content": ". | rawtoaces #475 . | Not heard back. Larry: we may want to reach out to Anton? Carol: Scott is on the call. Scott: I’ll track down Alex, what is the objective? John: we just need a project update, or if someone else should be doing this. Larry: there are other people contributing, such as Anton, he’s also on OIIO TSC. | . | OpenAPV - defining 6 month milestones #877 . | John: at 6 month point, there was going to be a report to TAC. TAC approval was to have a specific set of guidelines on how to gauge the project after 6 months. Youngkwon what is the deadline? John: end of March. Youngkwon: that’s good. | . | Security Threat model analysis for ASWF projects #615 . | Jonathan: 7 issues flagged against MaterialX, 4 were straightforward (crashing project with wrong data), but 3 are more subtle, waiting for feedback from OSTIF team, what’s the best path forward for these more subtle categories. | Cary: they reported 4 issues against OpenEXR, “garden variety” crash bugs, they fixed GitHub security advisories, Kimball fixed them. Not sure what to do with the security advisories, they are like GitHub issues but private. Not sure the steps needed to resolve them. GitHub seems to want to get you to file a public CVE, if that’s what we need to do we will. Unless the bug is particularly exploitable, not clear what to do? Also no suggestions about other findings, like our statement of policy, GitHub Actions… Are we “doing it right”? Answer so far has been specific crashing bug reports. Have been working on other things, but will get back to them. | John: have a regular sync meeting with Amir and Derrick next week, let me know if there’s something specific I can escalate with them. | Cary: they’ve expanded our fuzz testing, and given us pointers on how to make our fuzz testing more thorough. Larry had discussion with Foundry, appropriate to discuss these bugs to known vendors using OpenEXR in a private channel so they can get a new version out before we make something public. Larry: Phil at Foundry would like a heads up before we publish a full report. Security Analysis folks said it was standard procedure, there is still a gap where we decide what to say publicly, how is the vulnerability exploitable, and give time to downstream user to update. May want to take a step further to pro-actively involve them, not just give them lead time, but would like to hear feedback from a downstream recipient, which bugs do they consider important and why. Is there a rationale we can use to help go forward. | Gordon: from Autodesk perspective, we have an internal security threat analysis framework we use to work out what we need to take action on. We would love a window to react. Challenge is that it shouldn’t just be vendors, studios may want to know as well. How do you prevent bad actors from signing up? Larry: we can keep it “in the family”. Most of the studios are working on segregated networks where we trust the inputs, so our confusion as authors of this software working in studios, we typically don’t think about these issues. So it’s an open question for us, we haven’t had to think about it like vendors. Gordon: it simplifies things if we can narrow the scope. John: projects can come up with a standard policy on how to deal with these disclosures, “what’s the circle of trust”. Called “coordinated vulnerability disclosure”. Might be something for the TAC to think about, is this something that we should put some structure around to help all our projects. | Michael: at a studio, won’t be exposed, but as public projects, the intention is to get broader adoption and usage, we have to go towards that perspective. These projects can be used in other projects. Larry: of course, goals not in question, just our experience. Michael: there are groups paid to expose these vulns. Different tiers of certifications, one can be “in family”, vs wider. | Carol: a timing schedule is going to be tricky since vendors are often not up to date with our most recent versions in their software releases, so do we need to backport, that gets tricky. We need to come up with a way to have an internal decision, a place where we can publish these vulns to the group, can be quite a delay between a report and an updated release. John: coordinated release, after a fix, how do we get vendors aware. | JC (chat): ossf vulnerability disclosure is full of good resources on the subject | Carol: we need information specific to our types of projects. We don’t want to make a big splash about things that aren’t a big deal. How much is this worth to us. | Gordon: delay to a release depends on how “exciting” the issue is, for instance we pushed out releases for Heartbleed vuln quickly. Important is to have time to look at this together. We spend a lot of time on this, we have our own dependency registry so when something pops up, we know which versions of our projects are affected. Dependency chain is important, especially when projects (such as USD) use other projects. As an Open Source foundation, do we want to have a graph of dependencies. Also when our libraries get integrated in OSes and web browsers, all eyes are on us. | Cary: our Jira backlog at ILM has dozens / hundreds of “crashing” bugs, we fix important ones, but a lot of the time we just say “don’t do that”, we operated behind the firewall, and control our data. If we ingest data from random public, our stance would be different. Some of the bugs reported by OSTIF against OpenEXR are low priority. These processes exist for a good reason, OpenEXR integration into macOS is what the public disclosure process is for. But would there be a benefit to a precursor to that for the trusted members of our community. But I don’t have a sense that this is so critical a problem. | Gordon: have to apply diligence to small number of cases where it is a problem. We had a “Maya Virus” a few years ago. Need enough monitoring so you can find exceptional issues that have to be addressed right away. Open source doesn’t mean you have to fix every single issue someone reports. If something is very important to someone, they can always fix it themselves. We don’t want to sign up to fix anything that anyone ever finds. | Scott Wilson (chat): I remember that Maya virus. By the way, props for the virus scanner that Autodesk came out with. I think we need something like that for all DCCs/more tooling to help screen scene files without having to run the scripting engine. | Cary: this determination is what I would like to get out of audit process. OpenEXR isn’t doing any kind of high risk / high vulnerability functions, not a prime vehicle for a virus. Was hoping that someone who knows what they are talking about would help us with that. | Gordon: didn’t we talk about having a “Security Council” so every project doesn’t have to have its own security expertise? Have a group that projects can come to to discuss these issues. We could find someone on the Autodesk side who could contribute. John: one of the ideas of working with OSTIF was to see if we could get value from an outside firm, tricky part of “office hours” can make it hard to disclose things. People doing the work are finding stuff and reporting them. Groups are giving some recommendations, but are we getting to the end product of guidance for projects. And how do we disclose what has been found. How do you get the right people to the table. Need to disclose responsibly. Maybe a Security WG, don’t want to be overly prescriptive, but we’re seeing things where a WG could be of value. | Jonathan: Cary brought up that no individual issue found by OSTIF was as important as the process by which they found them, would like to know how they found them. Looks like some were found by fuzz testing, I’d like to be able to reproduce that. Would like to emphasize process over individual reports. John: they should be giving you access to that in final reports. | . | Dev Days - May 2025 #966 . | Carol: doing 2 this year, tried to pick dates that work with the list of events presented by David. May 15th and Sept 25 2025. We welcome feedback for next year. | Doing multiple Dev Days events per year, but single day event for the full 24H depending on your timezone (previously was 2 days). Should be enough heads up for the projects and member companies. Wanted to do multiple so that it’s not such a problem if you can’t participate at a specific date. Technically you can contribute at any time, but people don’t do that. We are trying to create more targeted opportunities to contribute. | Carol: also we’re not doing ASWF project registration, we’re doing Dev Days as a foundation, includes all ASWF projects. Some projects are harder to jump into than others, but we wanted to avoid extra admin work of tracking who is participating to what project. Also we want to give people opportunity to participate to projects they want. | Larry: previous 2 years were more experimental, allowing projects to “sit it out”, now we expect every project to participate. Just need to have “good for newcomers” issues, and decent build documentation. On the day of, pay more attention to channels of communication. We expect that all projects are willing to take a PR at any time, not “pushing anybody into the deep end”. Up to the projects how much they want to promote it in their community. Some projects were scrambling to release around Dev Days last year. | Carol: have new member of Dev Days leadership team from Animal Logic, did a great job last year to organize a company internally, and written great documentation that lives on Dev Days wiki. Will provide for Q&amp;A with company leads for instance. Larry: in the past had information sessions for the participants, but might be good to have a group call with people from companies, how the company can get value from their employees participating. | Carol: expect to hear from us earlier, as well as office hours for participants and projects. | . | Planning Session for TAC [#792] . | John: TAC has done a lot of project review / bring in new projects | Sometimes instead of just being “reactionary”, what are challenges we want to tackle. | Could be TAC meeting in 2 weeks, open planning session, what do we want to address as a TAC. | Carol: feedback on process, how we run things, is it useful to you and your company. | Larry: if all TAC meetings are process votes and annual reviews, this can get boring. Want to have space to have more useful information sharing. If there are people from a project or company who want to present something, this is a forum where we can do this, have the “right people in the room”. | John: I see TACs get to the point of wanting to figure out “what do we want to do next.” | Next TAC meeting is pretty open, so could be a good time to do this. | . | Feedback on Open Source Forum 2025 #960 . | John: different structure than what we have done in the past. Want feedback on whether you liked it, what do we need more of / less of. | Larry: I thought the content was really good. Was inspired, and thought a lot about it afterwards. People from my company attending remotely also enjoyed the content. I think we “nailed id”. | Carol: as someone who attended remotely, the content was great, but realized I missed a lot of stuff happening on site. If we’re going to make it an in-person first event, we need a lot of heads up and a change of timing. Nothing is going to be perfect, and LA is likely the best place, but if we want in person focus going forward, need to be purposeful about it. Or we want to be as friendly to the remote side of things. | David: we focussed on the people in person, and reduced number of online participants due to sensitivity of AI topic (for discussion part). Studios have tight restrictions on AI. This is not a trend, we are open source focussed, and will be open in general, this was an exception for this year due to the topic. In future we want to be open, including with the media. So expect more openness in the future. | Carol: I can see benefits to being in person. David: we will keep making things member focussed, with some additional invites. | David: would like to ask more about the core of the event, what we can do at the foundation about AI, if anything. Does anyone have comments / thoughts? We are taking steps to engage in the “what should we do” with AI in our projects. | John: questions came up on C2PA group around content provenance. Lots of overlay with the industry and some projects. Would some of this work be interesting for this group? | Larry: some of the groups have had contacts, had someone from C2PA talk to OpenEXR TSC, and I’ve talked at conferences. Desire to do something about obvious intersection when reading / writing formats involved. | John: anything specific would be helpful? | Carol: have a basic discussion in TSCs, create issues, put on backlog, will require someone in most projects to step forward and decide to work on this. | JF: any LF level tools to help between foundations to coordinate? John: that’s usually me, I have understanding of multiple projects / foundations, we have a landscape tools. Myself and rest of staff can be of support. We have models where projects cross-collaborate, lots of different avenues. Not a one side fits all. | Larry: we know about them, do they know about us? The C2PA speaker, had she heard of OpenEXR before? How can we be relevant to them? John: major LF events (Open Source Summit) are some of the good places for project intersection, member summits as well. Designed to be a bit like “COMDEX of open source”, that’s where we create opportunities to link communities. Maybe a call to look at ASWF presence at some of larger LF events. | David: relative to our side, we are quite well known within LF, our demo reel plays at top of every LF conference, gets us known. ASWF is known, then it depends if another foundation has something to do with us. Large companies which have TAC / board representatives across multiple projects could be helpful with cross-foundation collaboration. There are 1200 projects at LF, and over 100 groups, we are known but can do better. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | General Updates . | Dev Days - May 2025 #966 . | Larry: coming up May 15th, every project is expected to participate, but individual projects can decide what they can do. At minimum have a number of issues tagged as “help wanted” or “good first issue”, so people can choose from issues that are appropriately sized / skilled. Try to pay attention to Slack / Mailing Lists for new people who need help. Make sure your build and test documentation is up to date. That’s the sate we would like to think projects are always in. You’ll mostly see good participation and not extra work to do. Encourage everyone to participate! | Larry: on the company side, now is the time to recruit juniors in your org who want to try out open source. As leaders in your companies, make sure that anyone who wants to participate has all pre-requisites done such as CLAs. | . | Security Threat model analysis for ASWF projects #615 | . | Planning Session for TAC #972 . | Google Doc | Larry: Open brainstorming. We want TAC to be more than just annual reviews and procedural discussions. We want a significant component that is of service to member companies and projects. This is a chance to make suggestions. | John: also are there initiatives the TAC should take on. | John: everyone can enter ideas in the document | JF: collaboration between projects . | Encourage cross project initiatives | Gary: important to OpenFX, how to collaborate with OTIO to represent effects in timelines, OCIO on how to do color | John: CI integration, how much should that be leaned into? | JF: where’s the best place to share topics potentially relevant to every project | Cary: Nanobind vs Pybind11 subject came up, conclusion was “Nanobind is everybody does it or nobody does it”, but kind of died there. That’s the kind of thing that bears more specific investigation. | John: common tools and libraries. Cary: things that affect interop between projects. John: less “pick a winner”, makes it easier to consume projects. | Larry: OpenVDB went ahead and switched to Nanobind, so we already have different projects supporting both, so switch to Nanobind may be necessary. | John: how much of an overlap between toolchain dependencies vs VFX Ref Platform? Larry: there are parallels, but thinking of things that aren’t dictated by VFX Platform. Some projects thinking about CMake minimum version for instance, or the Nanobind issue, which are out of scope for VFX Platform. Cary: VFX Platform isn’t a set of recommendations of what to use, more here are the versions you should use. This forum may be more about recommending. Larry: VFX Platform is a spreadsheet of what the major DCCs are using, every project struggles with supporting this matrix, and how many years back to support. Kimball has given thought on OpenEXR to structure to avoid ABI breakage and reduce the pain of staying on the current version vs supporting old versions. This kind of knowledge sharing could be good in this forum. Lot of us would love to just be told how to handle these issues. | . | Talks of general interest to this project (does our project us an interesting technology the rest of us show know about) Hard won best practice knowledge . | Larry: no one can follow every project, when a project spends a lot of effort figuring something out, could share the knowledge. We could make a talk for Open Source Days at SIGGRAPH, or mention in annual review, but we could have 10 minute talks at a TAC meeting. | Larry: if OpenVDB wanted to give a lightning talk about conversion to Nanobind, would avoid every project starting from scratch. | . | Gordon: I like the system with upvotes (pollev), we can collect ideas, understand them, find other process to get ideas. | Gordon: prioritized view of open source gaps. What’s the role we play between “kingmaker” / allocate capacity/resources? Not sure who was able to listen to the steering committee for AI in pipeline. Where do we see open source playing in there, where are the gaps, where are there N projects when there should be 1, what are projects outside the foundation that are in use. A more “directed search”, not necessarily “here’s how you have to do it”, but more building a portfolio, where are the gaps, the opportunities, where do we have too much choice. Maybe a yearly goal to do this? . | John: I see TACs do similar things, try to figure out what is our stack, what do we need to focus, where are there no good solutions. What are areas of risk, what are areas where there’s too much going on. | . | Gordon: Do we need to do anything around Qt? We’re caught between commercial and LGPL world of Qt. As an industry it’s a de-facto project, the LTS changes introduced a few years ago introduce long term supportability challenges. We had some conversations here and in VFX Platform, should we have our own branch and maintain it? Are we at a point where we should think about UI frameworks? Should we look at other technologies, especially with less desktop centric UI scenarios? . | John: a very topical issue. | Larry: to what degree are you referring to Qt use in our projects, or at the member studios? We’re all pretty bound to Qt because the major DCCs are using it. So if you want to write plugins for DCCs, you don’t have a choice. Are you more interesting in opening discussion about what DCCs should be doing? | Gordon: anything in the Steering Committee discussions that should be given to TAC? | David: collectively the TAC is the core, I’m here to support you, and we’re here to support the engineers who do the open source work. We’ve build a solid foundation in last 7 years to support the projects and infrastructure, we have something good and solid. It’s time to figure out what else we can do apart from supporting the projects, what guides us. Forum was about open source and new technologies, in this case AI. We may have missed opportunities with Virtual Production for instance, some were done by SMPTE RIS work with camera, came to present to us, we asked them to come back with something more structured. They open source OpenTrackIO at SMPTE, it’s good that Open Source is happening there. But if we had had more of a “think tank” segment to think about VP, we could have helped these folks who came to us to grow and have a VP project we could have used to grow in that field. That’s why we put Open Source Forum around new technology and AI, this continues into internal discussion and what we should do about AI. Thank you Gordon for the praise about the polls! The idea of collaboration between projects is important. Another concept could be to develop specific UI elements like a color picker. We should ask ourselves at least once a year, what can we do we’re not already doing. With 15 projects in the foundation, good question to ask ourselves how they can collaborate. | Gordon: want to be open at suggestions from Steering Committee. | Larry: are you asking about the open source projects, or what the major DCCs do about Qt? Studios have to follow the lead of the DCCs, since Qt is what they are exposing. | Gordon: would like to explore a new area for us to explore. We came in with mandate to support Open Source projects, have a thriving ecosystem. Qt is different, not suggesting we start our own UI framework project, but it is open source we all depend on. There is a huge amount of inertia around Qt, both with the DCCs, and I imagine in the studios. Nothing will happen overnight, but we have to start thinking about this sooner rather than later. Maybe ready our own branch so we can fix issues together. Or longer term we want to go over to other framework. Qt has some commercial licensing subtleties, and it’s not super strong on the web / mobile, which are platforms we may need to get to. We talk about this in the VFX Reference Platform, waiting to see if “something bad happens.” | John: maybe a parallel conversation to the Linux Workstation conversation from a year ago? It’s a problem in this area how can we help? | Gordon: we’ve left a lot of this to the VFX Platform group, but it doesn’t have the resources | Nick: I’m gonna have to call out the per-seat licensing of Qt, and the alternative of copy-left make Qt a very tough choice for anyone without Big Corporation budgets. Having worked at Big Corporations where only Blessed Engineers get a license, I think the costs can’t be ignored. inertia = sunk cost fallacy ;) Nick: the costs are also very high, the Qt license is antagonistic to the kind of work we do. | Nick: More suitable if you are already in the GPL world (GNOME desktop). Gordon is bringing up lots of points that are important to me. It’s not an issue we should brush off. | Larry: VFX Platform is about pulling consensus between vendors and telling people about those versions. It’s not about picking the best technologies. | Gordon: it’s all about “versionitis” how do we agree on the versions of a popular set of components, so we can share things. As a studio can hopefully pick a set of versions and products that target a specific year. What are the components that people are using where it’s important to align on the versions. | Larry: answering “which version of Qt we should use” rather than “should we look at something else” | Gordon: may still be the closest place to have those discussions. | JF: there is no longer a place that seems to curate patches to the open source version of Qt | . | Gordon: Align on versionitis with USD? (Gordon) . | Goal of USD shouldn’t be to re-invent the wheel on well established standards, so USD should connect to OCIO / OpenVDB / … USD has an important role to play in connecting these together. On the AOUSD, not sure what we’re doing for versioning. Trying to get MaterialX changes to work in USD, we got trapped in versions. Is this something we would like to have more of an active voice. Encouraging them to follow semantic versioning? Do we want to be more actively engaged? | Jonathan: the USD-MaterialX WG is very active on this topic, meeting tomorrow. Gordon: thanks Jonathan to get us out of that pickle! But we need a holistic strategy across projects. | Nick: API stability, ABI stability and data compatibility. API and ABI stability are almost contradictory in C++ world due to lack of C++ ABI and the tight coupling with the STL. It’s a very hard problem. API stability is addressed with versioning, but doesn’t address being able to move a plugin between DCCs. So how can the data be interoperable? Working on architectural proposal to provide profiles and capabilities systems, so you can state your compatibility profile. Looking at requirements of other groups like IFC or BIM to get inspiration for best practices, hoping to bring compatibility practices to USD based on experience from other industries. | Gordon: hopefully schema helps up wrapping and amplifying value of projects we’ve built here. So do our versioned projects integrate with the USD versioning scheme. Not trying to solve the topic here, but do we think we should have a role? Nick: I would support that. Once we have proposal in a publishable state, would be happy to bring it here. | Larry (chat): Nick, maybe in Slack can you follow up with links decoding a couple of those acronyms and how they might guide compatibility issues? Nick: posted to Slack | . | Strategies on versionintis more broadly . | Gordon: move the version coupling we have in our DCCs to a central point (USD) that links nearly everything. It’s going to make it much more important to get right. | . | John: any expansion we would want to do? | John: I should have started a pollev, maybe we can curate this first. | Gordon: can be hard to come up with this in 30-40 minutes, give people a chance to add other items | JF: share the document link explicitly in TAC channel | . | John: homework assignment is to review the document, we will curate it and get it into a more structured state so we can prioritize and execute. | . | Larry: can you give us a reminder of which project reviews are coming up? Sometimes that slips people’s minds . | OCIO next meeting Mar 19 | Rez Apr 2 | OpenEXR Apr 16 | USD WG Apr 30 | OpenImageIO May 14 | OpenCue May 28 | WG CI May 28 | raw2aces: Larry working to reconnect | . | .

    "content": ". | Dev Days - May 2025 . | Larry: coming up on May 15th, projects should have their issues pre-selected and labelled, appropriate as one day project. Companies should identify junior devs who should participate. Anyone who wants to participate, start making contact with project and look at tasks. People who were successful were people who tried to build a few days earlier to “hit the ground running”. | Olga: make sure to reach out if you have any questions. | . | SLP Volunteer Opportunities . | Carol: coming up soon, have volunteer opportunities launched as of yesterday, and learner registration is live on the web site. Forums are for the volunteers, lots of different types, Karen posted in #diversity channel. Many ways to volunteer such as application reviewers, mentor (1h per week for length of program). Ask to the TAC is that each member should find a way to volunteer in some capacity. Also ask to find at least 3 people in your company to volunteer in some capacity, we want to increase pool of mentors / guest mentors. We would like to have more mentors than we need so we can make best possible matches. And please share the SLP website and application on the social networks you participate in. If you have any questions reach out to me, Karen or #diversity channel | . | Identifying Long Term Working Groups . | Which ones should be projects / long term WGs | CI should be a project | D&amp;I definitely a long term | USD definitely a long term | Zero Trust: a regular short term WG for now | Larry: any reasons to prefer a Project to a WG for groups that produce an artifact? John: with code assets, a project could have a clear intellectual property policy. If the group wants to use a CLA, that’s also useful. If creating code, best to create it as a project so you can have a clear IP policy. | Will have offline vote for D&amp;I long term status (no quorum) | . | OpenAPV - defining 6 month milestones . | Presentation Slides | Youngkwon: have prepared some slides, Sam and Erik Strauss were regular attendees | 6 months Review for OpenAPV | OpenAPV (sandbox project) . | To develop a royalty-free, open-source, open standard video codec for professional video capturing and post-production | TSC Chairperson: . | Youngkwon Lim, Samsung | . | TSC Members . | Erik Strauss (voting) | Sam Richards (voting) | Kevin Wheatley (voting) | Eric Reinekey (non-voting) | . | . | GitHub Activities . | Fixes from extensive tests to improve stability and error resilience for commercial use of the software.

Not sure how data is supposed to register in the system, and how to make good use of it. | Organization Dependency section seems broken, showing ASWF and Netflix as top contributors for last year, which is not the case | We’re still confused as to how to use the tool | Doug: it doesn’t seem to reflect the reality, over last year Autodesk / Epic / Weta / DNeg contributed most of the code. Individual contributors are OK, but not organizations. | Larry: not the only project that has this problem. | John: will work with LFX team | Carol: our concern is that people who have access to this page may see incorrect data. Doug and I know the data is incorrect, other do not. | Doug: we use the CLA system which is great, we know that we can map contributors to organizations via CLA, we want this to propagate to LFX Insights | . | Release Cadence . | Somewhat unusual this year | v2.3.1 | v2.3.2 | v2.4.0 | v2.4.1 | v2.4.2 : yesterday release, it has been a challenge, comes with library release, config release, full release of ACES 2.0 | v2.5.0 for CY2026 VFX platform release later this year | . | Development Highlights . | OCIO 2.4 . | For VFX Platform 2025 in September 2024 | Built-in ACES 2 Output Transforms | Updated configs for ACES 2.0 | More LUT-free transforms | And many smaller enhancements | . | In-progress for a future release . | NanoColor collaboration | Config merging: ability to merge OCIO configs into a single one, hearing a lot of requests for, working on for a future release | . | . | ACES 2.0 Output Transforms . | This work took a large share of our resources for last year | Very complex algorithm (much, much more than ACES 1) . | New custom color appearance model | Advanced gamut mapping | . | OCIO is the first to do a non-LUT-based implementation . | Runs as a shader on the GPU | . | Filled a vacuum for the industry as a robust, open source implementation . | Supported the ACES team by validating, optimizing and productizing their developer releases | Even vendors who don’t use OCIO were waiting for OCIO to “go first”, taking research code from ACES project to something that could be shipped in a product | Can’t overstate the size and importance of this work, even though it’s in a “middle of the year” release. Making this a usable product within OCIO, it has been “wild” and we will have more learnings. | Documentation in release notes on optimizations and speedups, we would appreciate people taking this to their companies and trying it out and providing feedback. It will take a while to get adopted. | 2.4.1 release in December had a “preview” of ACES 2.0, 2.4.2 removes the “preview” label, we consider it finalized ACES 2 release | . | . | ACES 2.0 Studio and CG Configs Release . | Highlight: new ACES 2.0 Output Transforms | User facing artifacts - an unusual deliverable for an ASWF project | Lots of discussion about naming, user experience etc . | Decisions show up directly in application menus | . | ACES 2 configs will be built into the OCIO 2.5 library | . | OCIO Library Roadmap: roadmap.opencolorio.org . | High level view of Now / Next / Later so industry stakeholders can have visibility | Want feedback as to how useful this is, what can you expect from OCIO next year | . | Initiative Updates . | ASWF Color Interop Forum . | Goal: encourage color space interop across industry projects | Who: everyone who deals with color interop, even if not using OCIO . | ACES, camera vendors, experts from VFX, animation, games, post | . | Why: color is hard enough without alignment - we aim to create a space to have conversation and tackle initiatives with broad industry impact | What: mainly documentation, implementation guides, recommendations. But sometimes supporting code in OCIO and other ASWF projects | Texture color space | OpenEXR Color Metadata . | Current group initiative | … | . | This is new ground for the ASWF . | Publishing recommendations instead of code | ASWF is not a formal standards group (eg SMPTE, ISO, IEC, ITU) . | Output of work may need to be put into a formal standards process | Figure out what’s the right place, and how much “officialness” we need from this work | Accelerating Open Standards development with Community Specifications | . | Have had some success | . | . | . | NanoColor . | Presentation at Open Source Days at SIGGRAPH | Initiative between OCIO, USD and MaterialX | Link to charter | Collaborate on the challenges of color management in the OpenUSD and MaterialX ecosystem . | Code is being written, but focus is on documentation and test assets | Develop solutions that are technically sound and flexible while also adhering to the various requirements and constraints of each project | Deeply explore the implications of various color managed workflows | Easy to overlook requirements, need to trace pixel through entire system | . | Ensure smooth interop between projects | The group of OpenUSD, MaterialX and OCIO experts meets regularly and work continues . | We think we have the right group of people | . | . | Summary: project collaborations . | Completed . | OpenFX - Introduced OCIO support in OFX 1.5 | . | In-Progress . | OpenUSD: NanoColor collaboration | MaterialX: NanoColor collaboration | OpenEXR - Color Interop Forum project | ACES Output Transform working group | . | On our radar . | OpenTimelineIO - thread started regarding color management | . | . | Discussion . | Carol: tried to keep it high level, if you want to stop by one of our meetings, you are welcome. | Looking for a bit of a breather after 2.4.2 release, but collaboration work is continuing. Library updates are important, but large amount of work goes into these collaborations, which may not result in actual code added to OCIO. This has been effective and betters the overall ecosystem. It’s not a much bigger project than “just” the library | John: should have LFX problem soon with org attribution | Larry: is there a plan to account for the fact that people don’t have “affiliations for life” and that association may be temporal at the time of the PR? John: LFX team will better answer that, we track through the work history, sometimes the issue is that when a profile is initially pulled in, it uses some LinkedIn data to help, which can throw things off. Will get LFX team to present, and see how we can all help in data cleansing process. | Doug: CLA would seem to be the reliable source of info? John: it is used as a data source. | David: with LFX, once we present a clear case that they can sink their teeth into, they do. So having them present here with their latest work will be good. Don’t hold back! ASWF is known to have comments and willingness to work with LFX. | David: a great update, thank you very much! This is a tremendous amount of work, and helping ACES 2.0 getting used in the ecosystem. | Carol: next Color Interop Forum meeting on Monday, will be discussing OpenEXR, want to be through with this since OpenEXR is used so widely. Monday Noon Pacific Time. | John: this will be vote #4 (no quorum) | Alyssa: is Monday’s meeting open to the public? Carol: yes, all meetings on calendar are open to the public, may need to update wording which says so. | Matthew: OCIO maintains its own Slack, which has a 90 day cap, which limits searchability. Carol: we’ve discussed in the past, I think we would be OK migrating, but last time we brought this up, would be influx of 100s of users into ASWF Slack, so need to be ready for that. There’s a lot of overlap, but not 100%. 90 day retention annoys us, but important discussion gets migrated into Confluence / GitHub, as a project we use Slack for conversations but not critical. Personally migration would be about ease of use, but there are pros and cons. And we may lose users who wouldn’t migrate, but would gain some from OCIO. It’s probably time to bring this back up with OCIO TSC. | Larry: Slack doesn’t offer a way to move a workspace from one org to another / redirect? Carol: I don’t know. John: we could research this and figure it out. Carol: would make life easier. We’re not opposed, it’s a historical artifact, it’s been “laziness” in last year. So we don’t have a stake in the ground either way. Matthew: about what’s best for community. Carol: but could hurt us as well to not be in core ASWF Slack. | Doug: Color Interop Forum is on the ASWF Slack! Carol: we wanted to make it clear that Color Interop Forum is an ASWF initiative, not just an OCIO initiative, to encourage cross project collaboration. But that’s an argument for other discussions on ASWF Slack. | . | . | John: upcoming meetings . | Rez will be next. Stephen are you good in 2 weeks? Stephen: yes | Will revisit planning sessions | Apr 16: OpenEXR annual review | . | . ",

Proposal would be to change from “Adopted” to “Graduated”, nothing else changes. | Read “Adopted” as “Adopted by the Software Foundation”. | “Graduated” may sound like “you are done, nothing else to do”? | Is the word word “Accepted” have connotations we couldn’t use? Carol: we can dissect these words, can take recommendations, but feedback are confused by “Adopted” and that relates to projects “in incubation” yet used widely in the industry. We’re trying to resolve this ambiguity, not opposed to other options, but don’t want to keep using “adopted”. | John: don’t have to decide this today, we can be bring this up at next TAC meeting. | . | Eric R: Netflix Representation Turnover . | Andy Jones from Netflix, will be handing over TAC seat responsibility over next 2 meetings. | Andy: recognize several of you. At Netflix I am product manager for our VFX platform, was in the industry for 20 years before, including Psyop, before that at Pixel Liberation Front. Best known for Cryptomatte project. Background is engineering, drifted into other roles such as VFX supervision. | Eric R: will still be around including for OTIO. | . | DigiPro CFP closed 5/16 #1003 . | Closes on May 16, would like to see some of our projects here. Let Emily know if you are presenting. | Larry: OpenPBR publication just came out yesterday. Jonathan: can you clarify what publication? Larry: the paper in Journal of Computer Graphics. Jonathan: not restricted to OpenPBR, a new diffuse model which is energy preserving, the core diffuse model in OpenPBR, hopefully will get picked up by other uber shaders. First official publication, previously pointed to OpenPBR implementation. In MaterialX 1.39. John: maybe we could have blog announcement? Larry: a lof of coordination and inspiration for that development was on the channels and OpenPBR people. Jonathan: you are right, discussions happened on OpenPBR and MaterialX Slack, and was added to MaterialX and OpenPBR at same time, paper formalizes the shading model, including some optimization strategies. Larry: lurking on those Slack channels was witnessing the development of these ideas. John: projects should flag us about such opportunities for promotion. Jonathan: took it for granted, but this is really an ASWF win. | . | Open Source Days 2025 #1005 . | Sunday August 10th at SIGGRAPH, at the Marriot Pinnacle. Ahead of the game on prepping schedule.

In the past had last minute speaker additions, would be great to have full VTH / BoF schedule at beginning of June so we have time to promote. Choose your time now, add speakers later, but please do it by May 30th. | Town Hall / BoF Sign Up Spreadsheet | Also thanks for quarterly updates, will add OpenPBR paper. | . | . | Annual Review: Rez #492 . | Stephen Mackenzie | Rez Annual Review Slide Deck | Rez Project Info . | Jean-Christophe and I have been co chairing TSC | . | Project Origins . | V1 implementation at Dr.D Studios circa 2011 | Author previously at MPC London | . | Incubation to Adoption Report . | Some new items ticked off | Asterisk is that more work could be done, but fine for graduation | Was prematurely thinking it could be adopted this year, but limited by available TSC time | Biggest development was OpenSSF badge project, as well as our process documentation | Need to get TSC to focus on this, finish a handful of OpenSSF requirements | Should be able to come back mid cycle for graduation | Growth Assessment: need to get help from John, not sure what this step contains, and who performs this | . | Contributor Growth . | Doesn’t include all ASWF history, came in late 2022, so looking over all time | 2-3 year cadence “see saw” | Easier to grow when you are a smaller project | “gut feeling” that a lot of smaller studios are trying out Rez, wonder how the contribution graph looks now. | Total contributors graph from LFX Insights vs Active Contributors | Have an “Adopters” file, a few recently gone studios. Very incomplete, some people asking early Rez questions in Slack / mailing list, but not easy to get whether they are actually using it. Pipeline TDs may not be in a position to say officially whether they are using it. | Several new names since last year, including some big ones. Will ping individual people on Slack to ask. | . | Recent Releases . | Last review . | Python 2 drop, slowly, then hard cut | . | New . | Synchronous payload caching, many smaller items (2024/10) | Small bugfix for backwards compat | . | . | Recent Developments . | Synchronous payload caching support | New “testing” object for use in rez-test | “default_build_process” setting introduced | Convert Windows registry queries to winreg pypi module | Many shell-specific bugfixes, mostly in Windows (cmd, PowerShell), default is now PowerShell | New adopters file, contributing.md updates, release.md updates | More legacy py-specific code removed | Numerous documentation updates (huge props to Bryce Gattis) . | #rez-wg-config-launcher - config-oriented sub-group created . | Some people see a way to manage configuration details. Rez packages can control OCIO config. Or tie to pipeline progress / stages. Rez wasn’t designed to be a configuration tool, was designed to create software environments, not manage what you are asking for. Lots of discussion around how studios configure how their studio environments inter-operate. | . | OpenSSF badge progress (2023-2024 delta) . | 91% -&gt; 94% towards passing | 71% -&gt; 83% towards silver | 52% -&gt; 78% toward gold | . | . | COCOMO numbers . | Maybe glitch in LFX Insights, likely because we have 18 vendored PyPI packages in our repo | . | Contribution Dashboard (LFX Insights) . | Jean-Christophe has been leading contributions (55.73%) | Company association data is nice to see, but usually every individual contributing to Rez doing it on their own contribution time, not on company time. Some company want to contribute their own development, but hasn’t been merged in a long time. Maybe data can be made more accurate by associating whether someone is contributing via a ICLA vs CCLA? Maybe that’s a way to clarify the data. Otherwise a little odd, for instance Anaconda does give JC a day here and there, but most of his contributions should be on his own time. | . | Last Year Top Requests . | From Virtual Town Hall | Better Docs . | 6 documentation PRs opened, 4 closed | . | Better Windows shell support . | Handful of PRs merge with improved Windows shell handling | Biggest PR on this has fizzled, original contribution company is defunct (correctly interpolates slash order). Hoping to finish it up | . | Better rez-pip . | JCM’s rez-pip2 is getting good testing and fixing of edge cases. now up to version 0.3.2 | Should someday negotiate migrating this to ASWF | . | Cloud package repositories | Caching-oriented features and fixes . | 3.2.0 introduced synchronous payload caching feature - more to do, but great start | . | Robust starter rez recipe set | Incomplete / dated knowledge of who and how many use rez . | some decent refreshed data on this from new contributors | … | . | . | Project difficulties . | Maintainer time - JC is doing too much of the heavy lifting . | Some of this is situational, some of it isn’t | Still seeking additional TSC member . | Had promising lead, but fizzled | . | . | Estimate that nearly all contributors are doing so on “individual” time, not company time | Advancing certain key features (that everyone badly wants) requires some deep technical knowledge and motivation | Docs (always, but at least there was a lot of movement here last year) | Tests need improvement and cleanup, the current setup harms dev velocity | Overhaul rez quickstart guide, ideally before a chosen dev day | Way behind on our written meeting notes | . | Areas project could use help . | Still seeking additional TSC member | Some hand holding to help us try out Dev Days | … | . | Feedback on working with ASWF . | Most issues with contributor time and energy | Nothing is drastically wrong with the way this is working, just wish we had more time | Not sure what this says about the situation | There isn’t a better place for Rez to be than the ASWF | But need to push forward more efficiently / consistently | TSC needs to figure out, more than ASWF | . | TAC Open Discussion . | John: thank you, great presentation | Happy to connect with you to finish passing badge. Stephen: yes, can we tick boxes… Also have written security policy, just needs to be merged. | John: trying to work with LFX Insights team | Stephen: if there is anything to be critical of, it seems ASWF hasn’t done much to account for FTE requirement / distribute work around. If you were to rank projects by member company support, Rez might be at the bottom of the list. Not necessarily wrong, member companies may not need Rez. It may still be appropriate for small studios, the ones that need Rez the most, but don’t have resources to contribute engineer time. Rez and OpenCue may have most in common, it’s an actual studio tool. Software vendors don’t have a need for Rez. John: I’ve seen this before in projects that are toolkits for a specific audience. | JF: one short of quorum | Larry: are we keeping track of whether voting members are present? John: we have the ability to do that, we haven’t done the analysis in a little while. Maybe do a nudge to people who may need a new TAC rep? | . | . | Planning Session for TAC #972 . | Using pollev . | Issue with “poll is full” | . | What should be the top TAC priorities for 2025? . | Identify opportunities to coordinate efforts between projects: 28% | Better leverage the CI WG: 12% | Prioritized view of open source gaps / opportunities: 12% | Bring in outside presenters to present to the TAC on relevant topics | . | Should we use LFX voting instead? David: let’s fix this and redo the vote | John: OK, this is a trial run, we’ll redo it. | Larry: David makes it look easy! Carol: can we send it out to TAC voting folks? | David: pollev is really good for live meetings, we just need to fix the license. There’s a value to doing these polls live, with a follow up discussion. Not so good for an offline survey, there are other tools for that. We should do more of these, and they are valuable, since you capture an opinion after a presentation when everything is top of mind. Extremely useful, and you save a lot of time to getting to a consensus. We’ll make pollev work | Carol: seems like the best tool to do this live, but not everyone makes it to TAC meeting, so want to get a representative view, if we only get half the members. | David: a good point, it’s a discussion with the people who are here, then we can send a survey, especially when we don’t have quorum. | John: let’s redo this next time. Do the items A-H match what we discussed last time? Did anything get missed / misrepresented? | . | Next meeting: OpenEXR review. Cary: we’ll be there. Also will try to reschedule OpenLensIO on April 16th. | April 30th: USD WG, we’ll make sure they know they are up. | . ",

First on April 28th, with the other 3 following. Will post dates in #tech-leads and #geneal and #dev-days channel. | Larry: can it be added to ASWF meeting calendar? Olga: someone from LF team will create these events so they are. Michelle: yes, working on it. | Montana is helping with organization of Dev Days, will be reaching out to company leads. She’s organized the Animal Logic Dev Days, they will have lots of participants, she will share info with company leads if they want to organize in house to get the most participation possible. | . | OpenQMC #434 . | Eric: no update | . | SLP Volunteer Opportunities #992 . | Carol: we don’t have enough mentors, if you have 8 hours in the summer (1 hours a week for 8 weeks), please volunteer. A lot of you have already done this before, but please, we need this again. If you have any questions please message me, will repost link to #tac. We’ve hit the deadline for evaluating applications, but if you want to do this, let me know, we won’t turn you away. Even if you volunteer as guest mentor, that would be good as well. We need to get to at least 20 mentors to run this program. Final count is 80 people after we closed registration, we will accept 20. | Larry: not limited to people on this call, if you want to forward to other people in your company, that’s good as well. | Nick: there are quite a lot of detailed questions on the form… Carol: yes we got this feedback. You can use “Carol says its fine” in the form if you don’t have time. | Karen: Volunteer form for Mentors and/or Guest Mentors for SLP | . | Rename project lifecycle stage ‘Adopted’ to ‘Graduated’ #999 | DigiPro CFP closes 5/16 #1003 . | You have a month if you want to submit! | . | Open Source Days 2025 #1005 . | Emily: CFP is open, submit your talk by May 18th. For Virtual Town Halls, please pick your time. Can also indicate if you want to do a BoF. | . | . | Annual Review: OpenEXR #483 . | Cary | Presentation Slides | Project Status depends on how you look at it! | OpenEXR Project Mission . | The goal is to keep the EXR format reliable and modern and to maintain its place as the preferred image format for content creation. | . | Steering Committee . | Same group in 8 years | . | OpenEXR / Imath Releases . | Trending down? | . | Commits: TSC members vs others . | Shows how much was done before ASWF was created | Normalize to remove before ASWF | Commits are light in 2025 so far | Consistent with past years | . | Commits: TSC Members . | Lion care is Kimball doing “real work”, Cary doing “plumbing and maintenance”, plus some others | . | Roadmap: 2024 . | Core/Multithreading in the C++ API: Done! (mostly) | Rewrite OpenEXR python bindings in pybind11: Done! | Finish Imath port to Pybind11: meager progress | . | 2024/2025: Improvements / New Functionality . | New compression codec: HTJ2K (High-Throughput JPEG-2000) . | Contribution from several people | Highlights a weakness: lack of effective performance benchmarks so we can judge the value. Internal testing at ILM, having figured out how to tune it for very good results. Jury still out. If it’s not very effective, we shouldn’t bother integrating it, but we will probably go ahead. | It’s been in beta, some DCC developers have done some integration, but not much real feedback. | . | New tools: exrmetrics . | Reads and writes files, reports data about I/O speed, compression ratio, we can use to gather data. | Baseline performance metrics, can catch regressions in releases | A consistent tool to be used over time. | Larry: could this be used via CI? Or version tracking is on someone’s machine? Kimball: we would need a “steady machin” to have it be meaningful. | . | Miscellaneous build improvements . | Better CI test, validation . | Bugs and regressions came up, tried to expand the tests to account for that. | . | Gradual progress on pybind11 Imath bindings | . | OSTIF Security Audit . | 4 vulnerabilities/bugs (via fuzzing) . | Went over draft report | Met with handful of folks, presented what the library does, they took the code and documentation. Hooked up their fuzzers and found 4 vulns, we call them bugs. One they labelled as critical, Kimball fixed it right away. | . | Proposed better fuzzer . | Service that uses Google Protobuffers to do a better job of constructing test cases, would be good for us to pursue and integrate | . | Was hoping audit would be broader than just looking at source code, we didn’t get a lot on the process of running a project, making releases… They looked at our GitHub workflows and didn’t report anything. They indicated that the human engineering aspect of threat actors is not their focus. | It was a good exercise, once we get final report, we can go back to the badge requirements and check that requirement and others. Haven’t looked at where we are yet, but it was one of the main outstanding requirements for Silver / Gold status. | . | OCIO Color Interchange Forum . | Sitting in on that, ready to help in any way we can. | Our philosophy is that we’re the keepers of the low level format, not the policies and best practices about how to “do things”, but happy to have discussions on anything that might lead to changes in the format or metadata. | . | . | Coming Soon . | 2025 VFX Reference Platform: OpenEXR v3.4 (or v4.0? not sure) | Finish Imath port to Pybind11 (and pip install imath) . | Took ownership of Imath PyPI project, it was dead, made request, took a year, but finally came through. | Now need a Python wheel workflow | . | Improved fuzzers | . | Project Weaknesses / Needs . | Windows support | Hardware-we-don’t-have support | Widening the contributor community . | Over 8 years since ASWF, haven’t lost anyone, but a precarious situation where the only person who can do significant debugging of the core library is someone who is a senior exec at a studio! | . | Transition planning . | Gave talk last year about “what it takes for OpenSource project to live 50 years”. Open Source Days 2024: Can Software Live for 50 Years or More? (Kimball &amp; Cary) definitely worth the watch if you haven’t seen it yet, (~23 minutes) . Fundamental part of mission project is “do no harm”, a conservative approach. This was front of mind when we got submission for new codec, but for a project to continue, it needs to be open to activity. Maybe we should err on the side of being open to change to invigorate the project. If we introduce a codec and no one uses it, it may not be a mistake if it helps the project be active. We don’t want to turn away contributions not from Kimball. | Kimball: how do we get to having a sandbox version where people can try changes and don’t confuse the world when we try “experiments”. | Cary: who is going to carry on? I’m still enjoying this, but at some point we will need to hand this off, and the pipeline is thin. I struggle to identify things that people can contribute during Dev Days. I do the maintenance / plumbing / CI workflows, it’s a hard sell. | Gary (chat): We have the same issue with OpenFX as a pretty mature project. | . | . | Questions . | Eric: any further discussion on GPU accelerate compression / gdeflate . | Kimball: after losing Steve that effort evaporated | Had some conversations with Foundry, but not recently. | Should be possible to swap in gdeflate | Larry: nobody is opposing it, and everyone wants it to land, but a developer bandwidth issue | . | Stephen Mackenzie: what aspects of Windows support requires help? . | Kimball: recently people were still compiling i686 32 bit Windows binaries? It took 2 weeks to track down since I had to make a VM environment. | Cary: sometimes a combination of Windows + CMake. Someone called out a problem where we were pushing downstream Windows compilation options. A good patch was proposed, but I wouldn’t have known how to fix this. | In preparation for Imath bindings work, working on getting Boost and new Pybind11 bindings building on Windows, getting Boost::Python working in a GitHub workflow appears to be quite hard, especially if you don’t know much about Windows. May have some questions to pose to the wider group. In order to host the project on PyPI, we need need Windows builds. | . | David: the hard work is paying off, was at NAB last week, Foundry introduced Nuke Stage for Virtual Production, they have high resolution EXR playback as a feature. It’s on their website. https://foundry.com/products/nuke-stage They were also discussion OCIO, USD in their private demos. | Carol: is MaterialX in the same phase for the security audit? . | Jonathan: our situation is similar, OpenEXR is ahead since they have finished all their issues. We’ve knocked out 4 of them ones reported to us, have 3 left. Related to how we interface with host applications. Kimball: 2 were in our testing framework, not the library itself. | Larry: an observer could get impression that “little was found” in security audit, but OpenEXR has been doing fuzz testing for years, so a lot of what an initial security audit would have initially found was already addressed. Jonathan: one thing we learned is the value of “grammar aware fuzz testing”. We have a basic fuzz tester in MaterialX, but a “grammar aware” fuzz tester was able to find issues we weren’t able to find with just random numbers. | Carol: we want to regroup, so we’ll put something on the agenda when we are “done”. | Cary: they gave us a draft, we met, action item is to finish the final report. | . | Cary: the people on the TSC Larry and Nick are committed to many other projects, it’s great to have you involve, but you have a lot of other responsibilities. None of the people who contribute to TSC have official company time budgeted to do this. I do this by finding spare hours, nights and weekends, it’s not paid for by the company, so it’s subject to the whims of my day job. Project is getting by with squeezing time from people with busy day jobs. Lucas Film is contributing their FTE between my time, Jonathan and others, but that’s different from an official budgeted time allocated to a project. | Eric: it is a mature project, we want stability from it. I hear wanting to get newer people involved, but the project is at a different stage? | Cary: it is no longer fair to say that OpenEXR is an old code base, it has been modernized thanks to Kimball. But for a project without a lot of turn, there is still a pretty stead churn of maintenance. GitHub Actions gets updated, have to rewrite your CI to deal with it. | . | Carol: it’s hard to find good first issues, things that new contributors can work at, but would encourage to try to introduce people to the project through CI maintenance. If they seem to fly with that, then they can start looking at the code. There’s lots of “non code” work to be done. Kimball: we talked about pointing people to Python bindings, but that work should really go into OIIO… | Eric R: if we’re going to add OCIO colorspace attribute to OpenEXR, if that gets done, could be a good first issue? Carol: depends on how we decide to add that! | Olga: make sure your good first issues are set up! Cary: haven’t updated those in a while, but have a note to update them. OpenEXR Good First Issues | Carol: this is why we want to do Dev Days twice a year, want docs, good first issues to be “always ready”. Nothing wrong to coming in as a new contributor and help with documentation, GitHub. | . | . | Planning Session for TAC #972 | . ",

Applications have closed, mentors being assigned. SLP members starting to join Slack, please send them a welcome. | Karen: we’re excited to have our final 20 as of this morning, they have filled out CoC form. If you want to mentor, please use the link, application reviewers is past, but team leads, speakers, still a small window. | SLP Volunteer Application | Karen (chat): final call for mentors and Team Leads(definitely do this soon if you want to be a mentor). Guest mentor, Speaker finalize soon as well! Thank you all! | . | Disney TAC Rep . | Rebecca Bever at WDAS is new member, was previously at Marvel / Live Action. Connected with Corey, excited to be here. Had some involvement with ASWF a few years ago. | . | Rename project lifecycle stage ‘Adopted’ to ‘Graduated’ #999 | DigiPro CFP closes 5/16 #1003 | Open Source Days 2025 #1005 . | CFP runs for another couple of weeks | Sign up for town halls | Let us know if you want to have a BoF. | Opportunity to do SIGGRAPH Labs, so if a project wants to do a hands on course, can do the introduction | . | Add question for resources to project proposal #1024 . | Add question about project resources, “what existing maintainers / contributors does the project already have” | TAC wants projects to come in with existing resources | Please add any comments to the PR | . | Propose to remove vote for annual reviews #1016 . | While doing votes for annual reviews is good, can be hard to chase down quorum. So the idea is not to have to vote, otherwise the TAC can vote on archiving the project. Please comment on the PR. | Larry: if you are TAC members, you have a responsibility to speak up if you think a project is in trouble / not getting resources / has disfunction, want to avoid having to go through the motion of a vote, but don’t hesitate if you see something where a project may be floundering, say something to the TAC. | John: Larry Carol and I are working on additional Best Practices and Learnings to share with the TSCs, may have TAC session about this. | . | . | New Working Group Proposal - Machine Learning #1029 . | Presentation by Larry | Proposal: Working group on Machine Learning . | Talked about this a long time ago, wasn’t clear who would step forward | . | The Troubles . | Nobody knows what to build | Nobody knows how or where to talk about it | Hype and anxiety at every turn | Tech companies control the narrative, who may not have our best interests at heart | Is there a leadership role for ASWF to play? . | Discussion after Open Source Days | . | . | What is ML anyway? . | Tools that use statistical techniques or by-example training to implement features that are resistant to traditional programming or step-by-step algorithms | . | Hypotheses . | We need a positive vision to rally behind | We need a lot of common tools &amp; infrastructure . | OSF poll revealed many common needs . | Major studios / companies have had the same ideas as each other | . | Non-differentiating – nobody benefits from all separately building roughly the same thing | So let’s at least do these things together | Leave more time for the bespoke / differentiating work | . | . | WG Goals . | Plan and spin off ASWF projects that use ML in artist-serving ways | Community and communications channels to share information and expertise | Leadership: proactively and visibly work for a positive, productive, ethical direction for ML-based tools that help artists and productions | Counter the endless external noise of hype + anxiety | . | Non Goals . | No doomerism or boosterism | No philosophizing or navel gazing about “AI” | No issues or politics outside of the film industry | No interest in tools that take creative control or satisfying work away from artists | No getting distracted by topics or projects we can’t rally dedicated resources behind | . | Initial deliverables . | Communications channels, get people talking | Spin out at least one sandbox project immediately . | Ambitious goal: a demo-able MVP by SIGGRAPH | . | One or more additional projects underway within 2025 . | Use WG-ML meetings to pitch, do match-making | . | . | Current Status . | Enthusiasm &amp; discussion . | ILM, Sony, WETA, Disney, Framestore, Autodesk | . | First project chosen (proposal coming soon) . | ILM &amp; Sony already committed to participate with engineering | . | Several other projects in discussion | Let’s bring this all into the light - join us! | . | Questions / discussion . | Ken: excellent idea, want to emphasize there are already activities, like OpenVDB (ML extension for PyTorch). Larry: don’t think it’s a conflict, if a project is already doing something, it should just run with it, may be outside the scope of the WG, but would like to benefit from expertise. | Gordon: Autodesk is keen to be part, one aspect is understanding how we handle the data behind all this, what can be common, what needs to be studio specific. Very timely and like how the intent is framed. | David: Sci-Tech Awards were awarded for ML-based denoisers. There’s been a lot of activity in different studios, we are past the pioneering times, it’s time to organize. | Larry: hope we get a lot of participation, some companies want to work in these areas but not sure what they can “step into”. Hopefully this can help focus engineers, start building expertise, instead of a single company “sticking their neck out”. ASWF has mind share and confidence of our industry, so we should be taken seriously. | JF: do we need infrastructure for running AI workloads? Larry: project we chose to work on will determine what else is needed to run on. | John: will take to LFX vote. | Larry: hope to pass this quickly so we can set up communication channels and can present project at next TAC meeting. | . | . | Planning Session for TAC #972 . | David to run PollEV Poll | Can anybody vote? Larry: we didn’t consider that, but yes! Carol: yes! Larry: anyone attending this meeting is relevant! | JF: hard to choose at this point! They are all good | Carol: these are priorities for 2025, so think about time sensitive things, these are all good and we want them all, but agendas get filled quickly. | Top 3: . | Identify opportunities to coordinate efforts between projects - 14 | Having project sharing interesting l earnings, or topics relevant to other projects, during TAC meetings - 10 | Prioritized view of open source gaps / opportunities for studios - 10 | . | Larry: if you voted for something because you have a concrete idea… but we will look at this chart and try to execute on it. | Opportunities to coordinate: what are we currently missing? . | Wave: DPEL is an obvious one, people looking for coverage of assets. There is “money left on the table”, we want to make sure that “OTIO can read a bunch of EXRs”, don’t know if people are talking about this in other meetings. Have conversations between USD Assets and DPEL, but what about others? | Larry: early in this meeting John made mention of Best Practices, it’s been a while since we’ve talked about expectations of the projects, how should TSC run, how should the TAC run. There has been a lot of turnover since then, TSCs have advanced their knowledge. So sharing those learnings could fall under this. | Carol: perhaps more opportunities for cross project coordination, come in and talk about color management in more detail than during the project review. | Matthew: notion of a “canary project”, MaterialX + USD for instance, if we can find something that can help with basic smoke testing, figure out version compatibility… | Larry: that idea would be a real service, may belong under CI WG, but CI WG needs some “love”, last 2 meetings has been small attendance. It’s getting sparse, we used to have better attendance. It’s mostly JF carrying a lot of the load. The work that WG is doing is an important part of the infrastructure used by the projects, and even beyond ASWF. SIGGRAPH meetings talk about using those containers, don’t want to see this fall into disrepair. If you care about the CI system and the tooling around it, put some time and effort into this WG. Does a lot for us in a “low key” way. | JF: liked the example of the presentation from OpenVDB to switch from PyBind11 to NanoBind | John: much easier to prepare for a 5 minute presentation. Larry: maybe we can make a special kind in the TAC repo, a “lightning talk”, keep room for a couple of those in a meeting. I bet each project has some nuggets that others can learn from. | John: some of these get buried in project channels. Will add a task for myself to put these together. | . | . | John: OpenImageIO and OpenLensIO coming up, working to schedule the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund folks, pending on issues and disclosures which will trigger the final report. OpenCue and CI WG are schedule for annual reviews on May 28th. Full schedule getting into SIGGRAPH, we may need to rearrange the schedule. | . ",

We’re now at 60 something (signups). | John: some people will also just sign up in Slack | Larry: good luck everybody, be prepared to receive the contributions! | Emily: we’re at 70 | . | Open Source Days 2025 . | Emily: 2 more days for CFP for Open Source Days. Projects which want to do a BoF, pick a time in the spreadsheet, same for Virtual Town Hall. | Want to be ahead of the game and publish schedules early so we can get people to attend. | . | DigiPro CFP closes 5/16 . | John: if people have submitted for this, let Emily know, what to keep a tally. | Emily: same for SIGGRAPH, OpenVDB running a course, OSL lab. If there are activities related to projects outside our own events, let us know so we can include this in our communication efforts for SIGGRAPH and DigiPro. | . | SMPTE 2025 Annual Technical Conference - CFP closes 5/3 . | John: until end of month for CFP, let Emily know if you plan to submit. Emily: we would like to put together a foundation level submission, if you are going / attending, let us know. | . | Launching Machine Learning WG . | Vote passed! | Larry: look at the TAC issues page for the original proposal / submission. Now that it’s there, we’ve already set up the #wg-ml Slack channel to see what’s going on. Soon will launch a poll for the meeting time. | If you have ML activities at your company and would like to participate, let people on your teams know so they can join the Slack. Project presentation you will see later will give a flavor of the directions we hope to go in. | WG isn’t meant for people to pontificate on ML, mission is to figure out what we can productively do together, and propose projects to spin off to meet those goals. We will concentrate on successful Open Source projects. Also a room for ML experts to talk. | JF: suggest to post the #wg-ml to #announce? Larry: want to be careful to not turn it into a general “chat about AI” | . | PR #1024 against TAC repo . | Add question for resources to project proposal | John merges it | . | New Project/Working Group Proposal: New Project Proposal - Dailies Transcription / Notes Taking Tool #1040 . | Presentation Slides | Tommy Burnette : ILM, have been there for 28 years, Director of Core Pipeline, was in Singapore and London, back in US. First involved with Open Source in mid 90s contributing to Python pre 1.0. Oversaw Alembic contribution to Alembic. | Background . | Rob Bredow summarized what has been happening, ILM was about to begin a hackathon where all engineers working in small teams on ML related projects. Surge of activity in this space, giving confidence in what can be achieved. | . | ML in Content Creation Workflows . | The problem . | Many shared problems ML techniques could be applicable to | Nobody knows what to build or how to talk about it | Need a safe space to explore | . | The solution . | ML working group | … | . | . | Dailies Transcription / Note Taking . | Timely, high quality notes from dailies and reviews are crucial… | . | Goals . | Automate Transcription and note-taking | Modular design . | Be able to update to new model | . | Shotgrid integration . | Not everyone uses it, but enough to that we can aim for that at first | Provide context for analysis, send output back to it | . | Flexibility and on-premise deployment . | Can use on prem vs cloud model | . | . | Features - MVP . | Transcription . | Advanced speed to text | Speaker identification | . | LLM-based analysis . | LLM integration | Note generation | Action item extraction | Can get pretty far with a good prompt | . | Shotgrid integration . | Shot/Asset recognition | Note creation/updating | Note linking | Timestamp navigation | . | . | Additional Features . | In scope . | Manual editing , note-taking, and tagging | Search and filtering results | . | Out of scope . | Real-time ID direct from audio/video | Sentiment analysis | Anything but Shotgrid . | Structure code to allow for other system, avoid Shotgrid-specific | . | . | . | Challenges and Opportunities . | Starting frmo scratch - together | What if they don’t want this? . | Talked to production workflow people to introduce idea, first reaction was “no”. Senior coordinators take these notes, they understand the context, they don’t want to proofread AI generated notes. | WG wants to think through where challenges come from. Want something that benefits people. | . | Starting to leverage Gemini transcription in Google meetings | Even just transcription of a busy dailies conversation would be hard to object to? | Natural Language query of production tracking info is exciting, “give me top 3 assets mentioned in notes”, having full transcriptions of notes that query has access to could be useful. What does the result of a query look like? | . | Moving forward together | Discussion . | Jim G: have done some of this on some supervision projects. Have you looked this not only for in-studio note taking, but also data coming in from set? Reccies, on set capture. A lot of data we have to deal with. Tommy: not exactly, we’ve explored what we have entities in Shotgrid, describing schemas of the database to the LLM to generate natural language queries. If it’s in Shotgrid it can be done. Another approach beyond that, an agent talking to Shotgrid could then talk to asset tracking database. So could stitch together multiple data sources. Don’t have PoC for that yet. Jim G: asking LLMs, starting off with CSVs / text files, what is done at ILM will be different than Sony than a production side supe. What are the definable fields that should be in a template to work / interop across industry. We’ve needed this for a long time. Maybe you are at a main vendor but have sub vendors. So a gret project. Tommy: possibilities are infinite! | James S: in rally / hackaton we figured out you can extend frameworks, if the framework can accept various tools from various studios, can extend LLM to access that. As long as the prompt explains the tool and how to use it, it can get info from there. | Tommy: when describing the agent, it’s almost like docstrings in your code, but the agent is reading them. The better the description the better it can figure out what to do. ILM can provide their description, Sony provide theirs… but under a common framework. | Cottalongo: every production string. has input/output, typically CSV. Asked for some sample data, impressive what coordinators do, the interaction is very fast, will be interesting technical problem to solve. From SPI side people are open to this because they are understaffed, reviews happen all the time, so looking for assistance / curious. They tried Gemini transcript but stopped using it since it was useless at that point. Custom LLM solution seems appropriate, third party LLM wont have as much context. Tommy: tuning the model that’s listening is important. Larry: potential tie-ins to ORI projects, media review tools themselves, audio tool is coming from a meeting looking at synced media, so that’s another source of info, what shot is being looked at when someone says something. | Tommy: even pronouns, “her dress is too green” | Carol: proposal would be a sandbox project, a great example of a “greenfield” project, we don’t exactly know what it is yet, ORI came in this way, hopefully can get momentum behind it. Larry: there isn’t an existing codebase, ILM / Imageworks are throwing their hat into the ring and pledging resources, but if other companies are doing work, this is not just ILM / SPI, this is wide open to get the best ideas and implementation collaboration. This is why we want to start this off as a “real” ASWF project. | Tommy: a fast moving space, conversations will be different in other studios. Perfect thing to start in a sandbox. | Dhruv (chat): Will this be completely greenfield in the ASWF or will there be something from ILM/SPI to bootstrap it? Larry: We’ve both done some prototyping, but no, it’s greenfield. | . | John: will take to a LFX vote | Larry: if people need to be part of the discussion, #wg-ml chat already exists, point them there for now. There will be dedicated channel | . | Annual Review: ASWF Language Interop Project . | Scott: proposal to move to Archived state. Running out of steam for project, and other maintainer also unable to participate, the WG is in limbo. So want to archive it for now and put it to the side. | Carol: this is very fair, and thank you for the work you’ve done so far. Language Interop is important, but may need to be handled in the projects themselves. May be the best way to move forward. Scott: Interop WG could still provide some documentation for a project who wants to integrate project X, here’s what to pay attention to, what works, what doesn’t. But haven’t had any energy to get the documentation started. | John: moving to Archive isn’t a death knell, just puts in a frozen state, but it can be brought back later. | Larry: any project can do additional work for language bindings individually, overall WG may not be needed unless there’s a required cross project initiative. This isn’t a rejection of Rust / Swift… just a resource issue. | John: this will go to LFX vote | John: thank you Scott for all your work on this | . | Carol: if there are any questions about Dev Day, we have some time now. | Olga: please if you know anyone who still wants to participate, encourage them, even if they don’t get it all done on Thursday | Carol: got 4-5 people in OCIO grabbing issues today | . | John: . | OpenCue and CI WG on May 28th | June 11th: OpenImageIO and OpenFX | May have some flexibility, but SIGGRAPH coming up | New leadership for raw2aces, getting them into the mix | Also going through backlog | JF: plug the ASWF PyPI org | John: will also want to inventory any other account credentials | . | .

If all timeslots are taken write your name at the bottom so I can figure it out. | Larry (chat): I just signed up for OIIO &amp; OSL town hall slots minutes ago. Pleased by the coincidence that there were free slots in the day of week and times for our usual TSC meetings so that was an easy choice to exploit our usual habits! | . | Launching Machine Learning WG #1046 . | Doodle launched for meeting time | Larry: just posted the Doodle poll link, will try to pick the best time.

Org as a whole is 6 years old, we look around the table and have a lot of projects which came in, rotating people, so worth a refresher for everybody. | Technical Advisory Council (TAC) Overview (May 2025) | ASWF Structure . | Governing board: financing, organization | TAC . | Projects | . | Outreach Committee | . | Working Groups . | CI: long running | D&amp;I: long running | USD: long running | Some have deliverables | Some have finished: Python3 | . | TAC Responsibilities . | Set overall technical vision for the ASWF | Approving new projects and WGs | Oversee project lifecycle | Enable collaboration between projects and WGs | Make recommendations to budget committee for resource needs | Voting on other decisions that come before the TAC . | We used to do it live, we now are doing it online, saves time and effort | . | Additional responsibilities in section 7 of ASWF charter | . | TAC is not responsible for . | Does not manage day-to-day activities and operations of hosted projects and WGs, such as committer rights, release schedules, roadmaps | TAC is not responsible for day-to-day operations of ASWF. This is responsibility of foundation staff. | TAC does not directly manage budget for ASWF. TAC makes resource recommendations to Budget Committee | . | TAC Composition . | TAC voting members . | One rep from each Premier member | One rep appointed by TSC of each project at the Adopted stage | Up to 3 annually TAC appointed industry reps | . | See section 8b of ASWF Charter for more info about composition | You can change your representative at any time by making a request at members.aswf.io | Projects can rely on these people when they need something from ASWF. Also should help evangelize within your company such as Dev Days. | . | How to propose an agenda item . | Agenda for TAC meetings are managed at TAC project page | Propose a topic for a TAC meeting at TAC issue page | Please submit your proposed agenda item at least 7 days prior to the meeting | Please be patient. Tac meeting agendas are often quite full, and the length of the meeting only allows the time for two larger topics per meeting, so if your topic is more than a short topic it may not be scheduled for the next meeting | If we cannot accommodate your request in the upcoming meeting . | Wait until the following meeting to discuss the topic | Call a special meeting to discuss your topic or | Refer the topic to the appropriate committee or task force of the TAC | . | We may ask you to provide slides 3 days ahead | . | TAC Materials . | Agendas for TAC meetings will be made available the day before the schedule meeting | Past meeting notes can be found at tac.aswf.io | . | Project Lifecycle . | TAC review all projects and WGs on annual cadence. Reviews are meant to gauge project progress, address issues, and asse lifecycle stages: . | Sandbox | Incubating | Graduated (Adopted) | Archived | . | Vote to approve the annual review is require only if the TAC feels the project should move to a different lifecycle stage | . | Working Groups . | Foundation defines two types: . | Long TErm (has a voting TAC representative - New) | Regular | . | Life cycles are simpler | . | Discussion Channels . | Mailing Lists: . | TAC public: tac@lists.aswf.io | TAC private: tac-private@lists.aswf.io (only for sensitive topics) | Project and working group leads: technical-project-leads@lists.aswf.io | . | Slack . | academysoftwarefdn.slack.com | TAC channel, make request at members.aswf.io | . | . | Project Guidelines . | What we have found as best practices for successful projects | . | Governance &amp; Contribution . | Projects are unique, our structure allows for flexibility to accommodate different needs | However we have more in common than not, and all projects should strive to ensure common baselines. This ensures: . | Projects maintain high quality and dependability that the ASWF strives to be known for | Ease of onboarding new contributors / projects | Smooth interop and collaboration between Foundation projects | . | . | Governance . | TSC is the leadership of the project. This committee’s primary role is to: . | Projects should have a GOVERNANCE.md | Set overall direction of the project | Ensure project community has the needed resources and infrastructure to succeed | Resolve any issues with the project community | Provide project updates to the TAC and community at large | Participate in code review and feature discussions | Sometimes no substitute for “liv” meetings | . | The TSC made up primary of primary committers or maintainers. Can also consist of primary stakeholders and dedicated users. | TSC structure can vary, but projects should ensure that major contributors and stakeholders have equal opportunity to influence project direction | TSC does not have to equal its committer list, but it should be close - and usually, all committers would be expected to be voting TSC members | TSCs should audit their TSC members annually, “move to emeritus status”, vs who are the up and comers . | Carol:Balance your TSC between important stakeholders who may not be active code committers, but can still be a voting TSC member. Keep TSC balanced between stakeholders, balanced opinions. A company may be contributing a large feature in a project, but not all those contributors need to be voting TSC members. What does the project need to be successful? | Larry: can be quire different between projects. Meetings are open, few things need a formal vote, most TSC meetings don’t need a vote, but once in a while you do. Best if TSC is not dominated by a single company, committer privs can differ from TSC voting seats. Some projects think they have constituencies that won’t be code committers, but still need to be voting TSC members. Up to TSC / project to decide what these roles are. | Larry: the one enshrined position is the chair, supposed to be elected, should ratify annually. That person wears a few hats: they come to TAC meetings, chair and run the TSC meetings, set the project direction. Also technical lead, but not a rule that these need to be the same person. Some projects (OCIO, OIIO) formally split the role into an architect and a chair. Can help split leadership role between multiple companies. OCIO had a large infusion of people from one company, wanted to make it clear that one company didn’t have all the votes. | Carol: look at add new people, help to make people better / stronger. | Larry: use this reminder to do your annual TSC audit, who needs to be rotated out (not attending meetings), who is doing the work and should become TSC members. Projects should do this periodically, at least annually. | Carol: also not “change for the sake of change”: TAC has more formal roles, we don’t expect project leadership to turn over frequently. But asking TSCs to play active role in health of the project. | Larry: a “do-ocracy” (from John): the currency of influence is people contributing time / effort / code / making the work happen, want project project leadership to correspond to people doing the work. Also if you are on a TSC, your role is not just to show up at the meetings, counting on TSC members to be helping to review PR backlog, commenting on issues, opinion on design questions, helping users asking for help. | . | . | Contribution . | Basic requirements . | Adhere to the project’s IP policy as defined in their charter. | Signed Contributor License Agreement (company or individual) | Signed GitHub commits (DCO) with valid e-mail address | Ken: are CLAs / DSOs optional? Larry: they are decided based on the project policy. John: each project has a technical charter, including an IP policy. Defines what license you use, DCO is bare minimum across LF, plurality of ASWF projects have adopted CLA, but projects are not required to, each project controls its own IP policy. Generally most projects have for the comfort of downstream consumers. | . | Passing CI . | We know CI can break, project maintainers can decide a broken CI isn’t related to a specific PR | . | Approved Review(s) (more on this next) | . | . | Code Review . | PRs should be review by at least one senior project developer, not including the original author (OpenSSF Best Practices badge requirement) | PRs should remain open for at least 48hrs (work days, and ideally more) to allow time for community feedback - even if it has received the requisite approvals . | Make review meaningful, everyone is always in a rush to get work merged, but better to take a breath and get all input before merging. If you don’t have an imminent release coming, there isn’t an emergency. Of course lots of exceptions. | . | Original author should make changes requested by reviewers | Some projects can make other rules, such as having 2 reviewers, or reviewers from different companies. | There are exceptions . | Time critical patches | Very minor changes / typo fixes | Lack of reviews . | Best practice to give some time, post comment about intent to merge, never merge without a comment, state why you need to merge immediately, leaves a paper trail. People don’t want to just see a long history of everything getting merged without any evidence that it was looked over by someone else. | . | Failing CI tests | . | . | Meeting Notes . | All project meetings should be open to any and all attendees (rare exceptions OK) | Meetings should be published and accessible via LFX calendar | TSC meetings should have a regular, predictable cadence | Notes should be taken and posted to a public space for every TSC meeting . | Options: manual note taking, transcription, recording, or combo | Suggestion: rotate note taking duties per meeting to decrease bias and encourage participation (OCIO used to do this) | Can be hard for the chair to take notes | Deke (chat) Can you enable the Zoom’s built in AI note taker? I use them for all my meetings these days. Carol (chat): yes we have that feature available now. | Larry: don’t just want 30 pages of transcript from AI | Carol: success varies, OCIO used to rotate note taking, fell off that, so now I take most notes. Doug and I share running the meeting, I may not be able to participate if I’m taking notes. Transcription helps, but it’s not the whole story. Don’t have to make meeting recordings public. | . | . | Communication . | Project maintainers are responsible for representing &amp; communicating about the project. This includes: . | Making roadmaps, feature planning, and release cadence open and accessible | Providing updates as needed to project Slack channels / mailing lists | Being responsive to issues and questions from the community | . | . | TAC Resources . | TAC website: tac.aswf.io . | INcludes much more detailed process descriptions | . | ASWF Overview decks &amp; charters | OpenImageIO’s Code Review Guidelines | . | . | .

We are ready! | . | . | TAC Open Discussion . | Carol: this presentation ties into what we talked about TAC / TSC operation last meeting. Exciting to see the contributor list. Larry: when we joined ASWF, we saw we were having tail off from outside participation, now we see it has really picked up. Even recently some people are being involved with really thorny issues, wonderful to see. | Karen (chat): I liked to see the DevDays numbers too! Did you see people hanging around after their initial involvement? Larry: one person not previously associated came to us with an image viewer patch, since then has submitted 3-4 patches, has “caught the bug”, steady stream from that person. We had 13 PRs in the fall and 5 in the spring, not sure we have an explanation. Not sure if concerned with fall off, Dev Days team still looking at full accounting of results from last year, will make presentation at future TAC meeting. | Vote via email. JF: actually we just reached quorum (13 vs 12). We are still voting on renewal until we merge the changes. But this vote is mostly about graduation. | JF: propose motion to renew OIIO and move to graduated stage? Carol: seconded. But we lost quorum, so moving to LFX. | Carol: make sure to pay attention to LFX votes! Helps to not have to chase down people. | Michele: didn’t get enough folks responding to OpenCue, please take moment to respond to that. Working to set up on auto reminders, for now it’s manual (John or myself), so we can stay more on top of it. | . | . | Carol / Larry: we can use remaining time to discuss “how does the TAC / TSC works”, best practices, suggestions. We want to end of the hour and didn’t have time for discussion, so we can also have open discussion on that . | Presentation from 2 weeks ago | Larry: one thing that wasn’t mentioned in the TAC, an important part is to have a good CI regime. The CI WG has done a good job of having ready made containers for the VFX Platform years, so for every project that is using CI, there’s a Docker container image with all the dependencies used by the project, the toolchain, so the threshold to getting CI up and running should be reasonably small. All projects need to take advantage of it. Having a robust CI that checks all the platform combinations on every PR is a key part of getting robust software that always builds. | Larry: on my projects I’ve found it helpful to not just rely on these containers, but also run extra jobs that do other combinations. VFX Platform not always on cutting edge of toolchains, and other industries rely on our projects. So I test non VFX Platform combinations of compiler versions, C++ / Python versions, latest versions of components. I have a job that tests latest released version of all project dependencies. Also have a job that builds important dependencies at “top of their tries” and build our projects against, so we know as early as possible if a dependency is likely to break us in the future. We are all looking for ideas from other project. | JF: there may also be value to using some common libraries: common XML / YAML parsing libraries for instance. | Cary: it’s a multi-dimensional matrix. one dimension is compiler version, platforms. But another dimension is compilation options, CMake options, have had a number of regressions that have broken because of obscure build options we forgot about or weren’t paying attention to. Trying to augment the CI to be as diverse as possible to exercise libraries as thoroughly as possible. It’s a lot of work. | Larry: it’s work to maintain, and also don’t want so many combinations that a PR has to wait 4 hours. Want to test everything, yet want quick feedback on PRs. | Dhruv: testing against latest Clang would also be helpful. Apple stays close to latest, LLVM team aggressive in deprecating old things. Larry: if you haven’t looked lately at GitHub runners, they have different levels of Windows and Mac, and Linux and Windows on ARM (as well as macOS). Can get a decent diversity, shakes a lot of bugs loose to do multi platform builds. | Lee: do other projects have strategies for long running CI? I’d like to add more, but… Any “Have your cake and eat it” strategies? Carol: what runs on a PR vs nightly / weekly builds, messing around with those cadences is something OCIO does. We don’t run latest stuff against every PR. You can change what folks see against their PRs. Still need to optimize, but try and keep developers happy. | . | . ",

Kimball: C2PA is about tracking the authenticity all the way to delivery, you could track a hash through training, so for instance if an actor doesn’t want their image included. So we can eliminate portion of dataset and retrain. A large data problem, but tractable. We’ve been doing asset tracking for a long time. John: also relates to GDPR for instance. | Eric: may also be doing synthetic generation. | Kimbal: some models trained from output of other models. | Jim: there are also efforts to feed data from production and master workflows, some work at SMPTE to get data into MXF, DPX. Not sure if some data captured in EXR? Capturing a lot more of the metadata around provenance of the model, but also human input that went into gen AI tool. Is this something you are looking at, and what the data model would be to support all this. Have been doing some work with ETC to inject this data into ComfyUI. John: this is Inference Time data, can be modeled in Inferable class. Could have a GenAI Inferable, holds data about the prompts. That would tie in with the current schema we have. We are looking at different licenses, agreements, so can track licenses per dataset. What happens when we transform data? Each actor could have their own agreement, but what if you are doing face swaps? We have to track chain of transformations. We are investigating how to represent dynamic graph. | Kimbal: trying to connect the data to the model, so we can make sure a version of a model has or has not a specific actor in it. Not just for LLMs, but instead all classes of ML. | Alex: who might contribute and/or adopt? Kimbal: hoping everybody will! Hoping we have a framework that all studios producing images that are a blend of images from models and live, so we can keep track of provenance, and make sure we value human creations. Hopefully everyone can use it. Also we provide utilities that provide good utilities to load images from OIIO, models via USD… | Larry: scope is so much broader than I expected. The people who may best know how this fits into our plans may not be on this call. May need some digestion time, make sure the slides and any supportive materials are available so we can discuss internally. | Larry: we probably need time to “digest”. Facilities will like an opportunity to offer opinion, what components they could contribute. | John: am trying to limit the scope. But want to make it open ended. But we have a tight remit. Larry: what is the “MVP” through this project? Minimal proof of concept? John: the pipeline through Nuke. | We should be able to share the slides. Kimbal: yet can attach PDF to the issue. | . | . | CI Working Group Annual Review . | Presentation Slides | Q&amp;A . | Carol: we can also make the CI WG a long term WG, “this isn’t going anywhere”. JF: maybe that’s the vote? Carol: we didn’t know if we wanted to make this a project. | Larry: we appreciate this work of the WG, projects would spend a lot more time working on CI. | Carol: move to vote to a long term WG, at a future meeting we should discuss strategies to help participation. John: vote to move to long term WG is the proposal? Carol: yes! | . | . | . ",

Being proposed as sandbox prooject, coming in sponsored by a well known member company we have a lot of trust in. Do people feel like they need more time? | JF: how does this interact with ML WG? Larry: explicitly came in under WG, analogy to ORI is apt. ML WG doesn’t really run those other projects, but coordinates between various ML efforts and projects to spin off, the more mature they are, the less they need to be under ML WG. Both are brand new sandbox projects. | John: LFX vote coming after the call. | . | New Project/Working Group Proposal: Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) #1091 . | Alex Forsythe presenting | New ASWF Project Proposal: ACES . | Propose to move ACES to ASWF | Short history . | Grew out of Academy investigation around a lack of digital filmaking best practices and standards circa 2005 | Convened many dozen of industry’s top engineers, color scientists, researchers, creative technologies, VFX and post experts, and filmmakers | Framework for a solution proposed by Ed Giorgianni (Sr Research Fellow, Kodak, retired) in 2006 | Tested various beta versions with filmmakers and productions before releasing ACES 1.0 in dec 2014 | Post 1.0 launch: focussed on filmmaker education, encouraged high quality implementations, collected feedback, refined the system, international standards where appropriate, added new transforms | Released ACES 2.0 in 2025 - new output transforms based on a unified model | 10 years is a long time between major releases! It’s a balance. ACES provides a reference implementation, then vendors re-implement in their specific products to support their customers. It’s about standards and best practices, walk the line between updating software yet providing a stable platform.

Alex: project under Academy, has its own license, planning to move to Apache 2.0, current license is MIT-ish in its structure, very permissive, some language about “no endorsement from Academy”. Eric: under Sci-Tech council? Alex: yes work fostered under Sci-Tech. | Doug: there’s already success stories between ASWF and ACES: OCIO, DPEL (StEM v2). I see why this makes sense. Original motivation was related to archiving, people were concerned about archiving digital movies. A key deliverable is standards to preserve creative intent. This is outside normal ASWF concern. How do we ensure that archiving remains a concern under ASWF? Alex: relationship with existing group, and Academy still engaged with this project, but in a different form. Standards piece is a big piece of it, and will continue to develop standards for those goals, in ISO and SMPTE, and will adopt new standards. Also a digital preservation project at Academy (picture and sound), Doug: will standards efforts still exist within Academy rather than under ACES project? Alex: there will be a close relationship, Academy is good at ushering documents through standards process, anything we can do to advance the goals of ACES, the Academy will continue to want to do. | Carol: an opportunity for ACES to benefit from joining ASWF, but also ASWF can benefit as well. As an open source foundation there are things we don’t currently do, but we would get access to people who have experience (like driving the standards process). The Academy “isn’t going anywhere”. Alex: an opportunity for Academy to advance ACES and to benefit the ASWF. There are certain things the ASWF is very good at, we want to take advantage of these for this project, but ASWF can learn from what ACES has done well, and communities ACES has built. | Larry: in ASWF the projects are very animation / VFX centric, but not a goal of the foundation. Helps to broaden our reach into broader film applications, this will be good for ASWF. Can you explain what you are bringing in code wise, and what you see developing going forward? Alex: we have a reference implementation, broken up into separate repos in 2.0, language is CTL (Color Transform Language). These would come over. We have input transforms, output transforms, look transforms. Using mkdocs for documentation generated from Markdown. Some ancillary tools, some are specifications like AMF (ACES Metadata File), an XML that allows you to describe a pipeline used to generate a set of images. People are building automated production that generates or reads AMF and processes images based on those files. Also an IDT generator for cameras we don’t have a full characterization of. A lot of opportunities to build this toolset, like AMF tools others are building. Get closer to production and make integrations smoother. | JF are these tools used in production and do you want binary releases? Alex: yes they are, although tools can use improvement. Have worked with partners like Netflix to rebuild these tools to rebuild them in a way that’s more amenable to production workflows. We’re trying to make these tools production oriented. | Eric: looking at the website (gorgeous!), the software side I’m not worried that ASWF can manage, but what about marketing program, logo program, vendor list. Looks like this is done by Academy Staff? Alex: ACES may be different than OpenEXR / OpenVDB, primarily a best practices and standards project with some software to enable it, Academy feels we need to be engaged with ASWF to bring what it is good at, Academy will continue to engage with the community? Eric: would we have access to Academy resources for logo program et al? Alex: yes, our contractor (Steve…) should continue to serve in his role. | John: would TAC do a vote? Do a LFX vote? Larry: is there anyone who feels there are burning questions? This is the right time. | Larry: have talked to people around my company, answers were either “yes please” or “it wasn’t already the case?”.

It allows plugins (shared libraries) to interface with host applications, giving artists thousands of new tools and capabilities. It was created in 2004, and has evolved to become an industry standard under the ASWF | This year has seem some progress, but not until 1.6 is release | . | Organization Status . | Contributors . | 8-10 people attend every TSC, sometimes we get 10-12, solid group | Only 3 github committers and 4-6 GitHub reviewers, need more! Skews older / commercial devs, not “sitting on GitHub” all the time. | Dennis Adams retired, he will be missed | . | Git stats . | Commits, past 365 days: 102 vs 201 last year | PRs: 24 vs 53 last year | Active days: 49 down from 101 | Merge lead time: avg 4 days, down from 27 last year (that’s good), down from 25 to 11 | Contributors: 10, down from 12, 33% me, 10-12% next 4 people | . | Monthly TSC meetings are solid, reliable, helpful and well attended. ASWF membership is forcing TSC meetings, which is good. | Mailing list: 50+ members | Slack: 193 members, up from 148 (this is our primary communication channel now) | Discord: 50 members | . | Updates . | 1.5 release last year 7/24/24. 1.5s with colorspace updates on 11/26/24. We were aiming for 1.6 by this summer but progress has been slower than I hoped for. We have a set of features we want to get into 1.6. | We are moving faster than before ASWF, but have leveled out. | . | Organization Status: Discussion . | We are still moving much faster than we did pre-ASWF. Monthly meetings help a lot, and the ASWF’s resources really help offload the admin work, as well as helping set direction and us goals to reach for. | But we’ve leveled out, and in ways have slowed down since the big push for color support last year | I’m hoping the new C++ bindings will generate a flurry of interest this fall, and maybe even attract some new developers | We will always be slower than some open source projects because we have major commercial users, and because OpenFX is a mature plugin standard, so we need to get buy-in from both hosts and plugins before committing a change to the standard. But we can do better around release engineering and support libs | We’re trying to pull people together and get consensus on how to extend OpenFX both into new areas and deeper into existing us cases, to ensure OpenFX is the standard for Visual Effects for many years | We’re continuing to work with other ASWF groups where possible; we’re planning updates to our colorspace support in concert with OCIO, and still working with OTIO on how to encode effects based on the OpenFX model | We need commercial and open source products using OpenFX to send them to the TSC, so we get feedback on what they need. People really want camera metadata in OpenFX, so we have started on this. Hoping to have metadata support at API level in 1.6, plus specific support for camera metadata. | . | Project STatus . | Tech . | GPU support | Auto CI builds, complete &amp; working, release process is now automated, artifacts signed | Lots of doc updates and cleanups | Small features lik NoSpatialAwareness to satisfy old issues | Conan: I sent a PR in spring, but it hasn’t been reviewed, so that’s in stasis -&gt; JF: I think it’s in and I’m using it for aswf-docker. Gary: it’s an old one. | In progress: . | Camera and other metadata support (EXIF, source clip filename, timecode, etc) | C++ bindings based on recent C++ and machine-readable… | . | . | . | Needs . | More contributors / committers / reviewers (not a single person project for now) | More engagement from TSC and OpenFX users | More input from new people | More git and github expertise among the TSC (better than last year, but slow) | Help to support our example plugins, and plugin support and host support libs | Better documentation of host feature support | . | Ideas . | I’d like more engagement and leadership from others in the TSC | We need big users like Blackmagic, Foundry and Autodesk to weigh in . | Timezones can be challenging | . | If we do another NAB event I will try to go, to represent our project | . | Discussion . | Carol: who is on your TSC? Gary: JP Smith from Boris, Pierre Jasmin from RevisionFX, people from FilmLight, Assimilate | Larry: you are doing well in many ways, people coming to the meetings, code reviews. Not all different than OpenEXR. If you can get 3-4 people contributing regularly, you are doing pretty well. No need to apologize for that. Wondering how DevDays went, pulling people in, what can we do to help with that. Also a couple of questions around collaboration: . | People on your TSC and some clients of your project are outside the core animation / VFX group that other projects engage with. Or there more people / orgs you can pull in. We can help you get some engagement. Maybe some opportunity to leverage relations in other industries. | You noted a couple of cross project collaborations with OCIO, OTIO, any others we could help with? Any ties to OpenReviewInitiative? OpenImageIO? Should OIIO be capable of running an OpenFX plugin for image processing? | Gary: Darby Johnson working on Toucan, a OTIO renderer that supports OpenFX. | Matthew Low: camera metadata discussions with the USD Camera Working Group? Gary: yes, will reach out in a month or two. Matthew: they have good relationships with camera vendors, maybe a useful conversation. Gary: people in OpenFX want 3D camera as well, but EXIF data would already be good. We don’t even have timecode right now. | Gary: our community is a bit different, we mostly go to NAB / IBC, 2D / Image Processing, ASWF may be more of a “SIGGRAPH crowd”, but we see a lot of cross pollination. Anything we can do to help, we know folks in the broadcast / 2D space, may be able to make connections. | David: we first went to NAB, but now we’ve approved the ACES project, which has been going to NAB in a big way and to IBC. There’s a lot of activity around that, we are likely to follow in their footsteps to go to NAB and IBC with a stronger story. Would encourage you to think about how you want us to present OpenFX in that context, not sure there is affinity between ACES and OpenFX? Can OpenFX help run these transforms? Carol: lots of this comes through OCIO, which we can already talk about. Gary: most people using OCIO color management in OpenFX want to use it for ACES workflows. Will try to get to NAB this year. | Gary: we didn’t do anything for Open Source Days this year, I should have since I was in the middle of the C++ bindings effort. Larry: next one in September. Gary: yes, I will do that, I will have identifiable things people will be able to help with. In the past it’s been hard to find things to do. Larry: if you have bite sized projects… Gary: will def do that. C++ bindings already working for me, they’ve worked for some consulting projects. | David: also OpenAPV | . | . | . | Dev Days recap May 15, 2025 #1070 . | Olga | Dev Days 2025 May 2025 Report | Presentation Slides | Goals for 2025 Dev Days . | ALl ASWF projects participate | Increase Participation amongst contributors | Create a replicable framework… | . | Dev Days by the numbers . | 78 registered, 29 participated | Majority from US, Canada, Australia | Majority were new / first time contributors, but also returning ones | Didn’t have a lot of answers to the questionnaire (17), take results with grain of salt | This year all 16 ASWF projects were open to Dev Days contributors . | 10 projects had PRs | 34 PRs | 27 merged as of 05/23/25 | MaterialX had the most | . | Dev Days 2023-2025 . | A bit of a fall from 2024 to May 2025 event, except for number of projects chosen | Didn’t expect high numbers, since not that much “marketing”. We’ll see what happens for September | Carol: this is on purpose from the organizers, an experiment to see what happens without the pull from SIGGRAPH / Open Source Days, and see how that changes with second event. Dev Days is still quite new, only our 3rd event, still in experimentation phase. | Larry: we’re not sure what the right basis for comparison: event to event? Year to year? We’ve only done half the year so far. Holding back on drawing too many conclusions. | Olga: excited to see what September and then 2026 brings. See what works, what doesn’t work. | . | Feedback . | Only 17 responses, but some conclusions can be drawn | Need to send the form immediately after event | Main reasons no to contribute were technical and build difficulties. Also some people continued to work on their issues after the event. | Access to information was reported as easy, so not the barrier to contribute. | Results on “How satisfied were you with the Dev Days logistics from the #devdays channel”, but could still be improved | “How satisfied were you with the support from the project”: on average everyone was very satisfied by project support. | . | Feedback from Participant Questionnaire . | Shout outs for MaterialX and others, people connected on a personal level | Variety of experiences, some returning contributors felt there was a lot of support. Some people felt they had trouble finding issues to work on. Also inconsistency between projects on the support offered. | Comments generally positive, we are happy with that. | . | Key Takeaways . | Successes . | Additional Dev Days Session “How to host a Dev Days at your company” | Increase in number of projects chosen by participants | Improved documentation and recorded sessions for participants | Improved project documentation and issue labels | . | Room for Improvement . | Promotion, marketing, or publicity of Dev Days could be timed better with other Open Source events | Sending feedback form sooner | Room for improvement of organizational framework and documentation | Returning contributors… | . | . | . | Discussion . | Larry: open to all feedback, what was difficult, what is keeping it from being more successful for your project | Olga: also feel free to reach out at a later date. We want to improve the numbers and the support for the projects. | Cary: for OpenEXR, I struggled to come up with issues tractable for first time contributors. Sometimes we get someone very senior who wants to tackle something, but not easy for first time contributors. Struggle to come up with something for OpenEXR. I’m sure other projects have similar experiences. | Larry: Olga made reference in planning recap: some people had successful Dev Days the first time, but not sure to re-engage. Maybe we need a “good second issue” tag. Need to transition from a first contribution to next, bigger “bite”. Maybe some projects are more amenable to “good first issues”, maybe other projects can concentrate on “good second / third issues”, some people are not there for the first time, but still want to contribute. | Carol: I understand what Cary is saying, similar experience in OCIO. There are good first issues, docs related issues, one PR was changing an image on the web site, it was great and needed. It is a fine lance between balancing the work needed by the project… We should all be able to have at any time a few “good first issues” tag. Even if this means the contributor does need some previous experience. | Olga: need to get a bit creative on the project side, like “updating the logo / documentation” and providing the steps in the issue. | Matthew: wanted to call out how useful the “How to host a dev days” session was. We’re not were we want to be yet, but it helped to bootstrap at Dreamworks. Did we inventory company affiliation for contributors? Olga: we have the data, but don’t have a graph / visual. Can share at next TAC meeting or offline. Also want to nail how many people participated in all 3 events, or only 2. | JF: perhaps having some common infrastructure on how to use AI assisted coding systems to understand the structure of a project. | Larry: there was some discussion on Slack about an LLM that can summarize the major features of an open source project. Looked kind of interesting. For TAC company representatives: this is how we attract new people, but also how do we provide professional development opportunities for your more junior engineers (Carol: senior as well!). There can be “selfish” motivation to help recruit internally. DeepWiki | Cary: two different objects. An avenue to bring in junior people who haven’t contributed before, get over the hurdle, and here’s how you create a PR. A great experience. Last year we had Lucas Miller looking at PyBind11 for Alembic, and Dev Days kicked that process. Can we use this semi annual process to encourage very senior engineers to step up. They are not good first issues, but a bite sized chunk of work so we can encourage senior people. Olga: that’s what the DevDays25 label was for as well. Company “pressure” can also help with more senior engineers. Cary: I took the approach “I just tagged a bunch of issues”, but will be more pro-active next year to track down people. Carol: also we can think about this on the marketing side. The way we present it is “this is how you contribute for the first time”, maybe we need to adjust this and show different levels of contribution. The “bite sized” nature of the contribution is the key. | David: maybe we pigeonholed ourselves with first time contributions. That’s really good feedback. | . | . | . ",

If projects leads want to talk to him about the process. | Cary: I think everybody should do this, you won’t know the specifics of what will be uncovered until you do it. For OpenEXR there was a team of security experts from Shielder who took the software, went off, didn’t ask many questions, but discovered 4 bugs. We fixed them (would have called them bugs), they referred to them as vulns. We used the GitHub Security Advisory mechanism to host the bugs, we rolled out the fix, made a release, and well after that, in sync with OSTIF report release, we published the CVEs. Vast majority of focus / attention was around their investigation and discovery of bugs in the library. I was kind of hoping for more of a holistic analysis of the security of the hole project, vulnerability to social engineering, are there other processes we should be implementing. But they did look at the project as a whole, and didn’t come up with something else to comment on. The process was quite long, first started in January, overall a positive experience. | Jonathan: agree with Cary. We thought about things we hadn’t thought about before, including recursion, where you can craft a 10,000 level file. Valuable to have this perspective, anything that’s possible will happen and needs to be handled. When the publication went out describing the Shielder process, the response was “there are vulnerabilities in OpenEXR and MaterialX”, instead of “OpenEXR and MaterialX take security seriously”. I wish the framing would be that the projects take security seriously. | Larry: “the Internet does its Internet thing”. This isn’t cheap, both in terms of actual money, also time from the team. We did it as a test run for these 2 projects, we both said this is valuable, but not sure every project can do this, especially with great regularity. Are there lessons learned from these 2 projects we could learn to apply to other projects without having to go through a full audit? | Cary: a disappointing aspect is that it is an analysis of a moment in time, they found a bug as of a commit in January, we could be adding new bugs. They identified current problems, without doing much to help us avoid doing this in the future. The bugs were buffer overruns, the kind which can creep into your code. Be mindful of testing, reviewing changes. John: I think they also added fuzz testing? Cary: they proposed a new fuzzing mechanism based on a Google service (protobuf based), and gave us a bit of a stub of a new fuzzer, but it’s not complete. | Jonathan: they used a strategy to mutate XML files based on the rules of XML to create valid but problematic data sets. But they didn’t give us the code they used. Would like to incorporate this approach in the future. | Gordon: even when you set these things up, these investments are “for life”, you have to look at all the errors generated over time, have to update the framework over time. I’m supportive of the questions around ‘what can we share’. | Cary: there was little communication from the team about the percentage of coverage in our test suite, their testing was mostly fuzz testing or manual inspection. OpenEXR has 80% test coverage, surprised they didn’t say that needed to be higher. | Larry: in many of OpenSSF badging, we often hear “can you articulate what the threat model is”: what is a bug? what is a vulnerability? Do you feel you are closer to being able to articulate the threat model? | Cary: the buffer overrun was labeled critical. There is another variety of flaws where you can construct an OpenEXR file with an impossibly large image with a very small file through compression, if the library loads that, it will run out of memory and crash. We provide mechanisms for applications to put a limit on the image size, but the library leaves that to the calling application. That’s a grey area, our test suite either imposes restrictions that don’t reflect the real world. We’re not sure of the right approach. | Gordon: a great example of some of the variance I’ve seen in third party security audits. You give them a system description, they look for API, network traffic, and apply standard tools. I see less frequently trying to figure out “what does this thing do”? Constructing an image with “weird” sizes is domain specific, and typically never done by third parties, you have to do this in your team. In Maya we know our plugin system, a command port, these didn’t get the focus from 3rd party audit. It is often very boiler plate. | Larry: Autodesk products incorporate our projects, what do you expect from us? DCCs, OSes like macOS deal with OpenEXR files. We don’t want to be the weak link, but we’re not in the heads of the consumers of our projects. Gordon: OSes and web browsers evaluate at another level, they want zero defects. For Maya we want to squash as many bugs as possible, but “you” have the answer for Maya (the studios). We want to deliver a security posture that works for the studios rather than tick the box. Larry: at our studio we are separate, control the inputs, if the DCC crashes, we restart it. We don’t run an external facing web service. Gordon: when we do a threat model, it’s about identifying trust boundaries in the system. What things do you trust since they are controlled by the user, where do I cross into an untrusted zone: third party plugins, download from the web. We try to have a high level of security for things we don’t trust (plugins for instance), if you trust it, we want to get out of the way. But we are moving to more cloud facing workflows. We had a security issue with USD which had us “stop the presses”, we also had the “Maya virus”. But yes we often run in a high trust environment, we don’t want to lock down our API. | John: maybe worth doing an offline discussion, maybe at Open Source Days. We will have Amir at OSS, maybe good questions to bounce off him, figure out what makes sense. | . | OpenQMC #434 . | John / Framestore: we have been working towards the goal of having NVIDIA sign off on the patent concerns. | Eric: we have a “covenant not to assert” to declare that what is in the OpenQMC project as of a specific date has nothing that NVIDIA would object to. This was code that NVIDIA has patents to, but hasn’t written. Hope that lets everybody breathe easily and use the project. | Josh: thank you Eric, has been a good collaboration. Looking for advice on next step towards getting on track towards an ASWF sandbox stage project, and the vote for that. | Carol: do you want to do a quick summary of the project to remind people? | Slide Set: OpenQMC ASWF Sandbox Proposal | OpenQMC Background . | Original idea for open source from 2018 ACM TOG on rendering | OpenQMC is park of Freak, Framestore’s production renderer | Considerable amount of experience in this area | . | OpenQMC Problem Case . | Reducing noise in production rendering is expensive | OpenQMC is one way of making this more efficient | APplies methods from Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) | Critical component to physically based renderers | . | Overview . | OpenQMC includes . | Library for sampling low discrepancy points . | C++ with no dependencies | … | . | . | . | Summary . | C++ library for graphics engines | Reduces noise and optimises performance | … | . | Motivation for Sandbox . | Framestore became an ASWF member | Common mission with ASWF . | Collaborate to build quality tools | Have an open forum for contribution | Provide governance for a standard solution | . | Benefit for the community . | Provide a test and high quality solution for point sampling | Document workflows for common use cases and integration | . | Project benefits from ASWF sandboxing . | Provide exposure to a larger community to grow | Help steer the project to meet the community needs | USe the sandbox stage to allow for API breaking changes | . | . | Project alignment . | Built from the beginning for open source | Based on the ASWF sample project | Issue tracking, meeting notes etc | Uses VFX Reference Platform | Contribution process . | Apache License 2.0 | DCO sign off required | Digitally signed commits | PRs and CI | . | . | Summary . | Framestore are committed to continue contributing further improvements from production to this open initiative. We think the project’s mission to standardize such technology across our industry, together to collaborate and achieve ever greater tools for content creation, aligns with the goals of ASWF. | . | Larry: when previously presented, only concern was legal issues which are now squared away. | Jonathan: excited about having this an ASWF project, in same way that OCIO / OIIO are leveraged, are there opportunities to leverage OpenQMC in other ASWF projects? Josh: definite opportunities, the people who have come in to early access have echoed this. OSL would be a great candidate. We’ve taken design decisions such as inline directly, CUDA compatible, so if you can JIT compile a shader graph, it has the sampling API where you can create domain trees in an optimal way. Don’t build parts of the tree you don’t use. Also MaterialX. | Larry: OSL angle is interesting. We have a toy renderer which is not suitable for production but useful for testing, would be interesting to hook up. Also as a scaled down renderer could provide an implementation example. Another potential OSL tie in would be for shader writers who want a library for well distributed sampling points. What’s the interface between MaterialX, OSL, with OpenQMC underneath. So can expose language features for shader writers. | Josh: we want to keep the API open, since we need input from other groups. We are open to steering the API in the direction it needs to go. | Gordon: very cool project, happy to see it happening. On the legal front, the proposed model has been reviewed? Eric: we haven’t run it through LF legal. Gordon: has this been involved? Eric: no, so far only involved NVIDIA and Framestore model. Gordon: the patent was the sticking point, would be good to have it review. Also is the grant only for studio use, for any open use, or commercial software? Eric: similar to Apache 2.0 license that OpenQMC is open. | David: John will have the data on this, but my recollection is that had flagged this issue to the TAC, we can ask him offline to check on how we handled it. Gordon: good to close the loop with LF legal, “are we all good”. Matthew: language is already in the repo but repo is private, could this be shared to make sure everyone is comfortable? Johsn: we can make the project repo open now. | Michelle: sounds like it’s not an issue / already addressed, but will have him address it. Larry: I think you can open up the repo for people to look at, the spirit of what NVIDIA is trying to do is unambiguous, even if some language needs to be tightened up. But the repo can be open. If the code had been written by NVIDIA under Apache 2, that would have not been a problem. It’s clear what everyone intends, but want to make sure it says that in the language. | Gordon: the intention is wonderful, but this is a new pattern for us, so a good place for legal reps to agree this is the right way to do this. | Matthew Low: MoonRay has been enthusiastic and fully support the project. | Josh: we will open up the repo, share the project, and get feedback. | Larry: are we ready to schedule an LFX vote (from John), or do we want to wait until we have that nailed down? You can vote to accept the project and not use it. Gordon: would support a vote contingent on LF legal approval. I’m not the right person to comment on that, but would be OK with vote contingent. Larry: we will chase that down, then get a vote started offline. David: makes sense. | . | David: new member announcement . | Welcome Sean Cooper from Skydance Animation who has just joined us, will be announced just before SIGGRAPH. | Sean Cooper: have been involved with OCIO, may be some ACES related announcements. Happy to be here and help as much as I can. | David: ACES project in ASWF was announced this morning, Sean will be involved with this transfer. | . | Larry: keep your eyes open for the town halls, BoFs, KeyNotes… There are a flurry of announcements of new members, new members, a busy time for us. | .

But we need to differentiate our content compared to DigiPro | . | Hard to choose between Sunday Siggraph sessions and Open Source Days . | SIGGRAPH courses (Physically Based Shading) | . | If you sat near the doors, the talking outside was distracting relative to the (reasonable) audio levels in the room | More time for BoFs | Beers of a Feather competed with Papers Fast Forward - Larry: not suggesting there is a better day | . | Larry: the room was fairly full, but were any presentations where people couldn’t come in? . | Emily: there were people in overflow room in the morning, but we closed it around noon. | Larry: seems the room size was perfect | Wave: every SIGGRAPH BoF room was too small! Larry: lots of complaints all week. But we did well. | David: it’s our missing to support our projects, we intend to continue to do it this way and support our BoFs. | Carol: for OCIO BoF there was some feedback that the room as “too big” and didn’t promote conversation, but rather have too much room than not enough. David: we can close some of the rows. | Passing microphones around is disruptive. | Wave: Access in/out from side doors was distracting, SIGGRAPH usually has only a single door in the back. So would be helpful to only have a single door. Larry: especially once the session starts. | Carol: a lot of this is controlled through volunteers. We have new folks through SLP, maybe they could help in a similar capacity. | Emily: we could try to recruit volunteers to help with registration and checkin. Carol: we can offer swag, we can’t offer the same benefits as SIGGRAPH, but can do other things. | . | David: thank you for your feedback on Open Source Days! | Larry: SIGGRAPH is composed of a lot of overlapping groups, the people who know about Open Source is a narrow slice of people involved with the studios. Not sure how much other people knew that OSD was happening without already being “on the inside”. Do we want more publicity? My son was a student volunteer, and talking to other volunteers, they had never heard of it. | Emily: should we bring back a BoF geared towards students to present careers. Carol: would prefer something like that, maybe a D&amp;I BoF. D&amp;I group has worked with student volunteers, but it was on Thursday, how do we get into these groups before so we can encourage them to come to OSD. | Emily: what are the groups? Is there a segment we are missing and would be beneficial for the foundation? Then we can do a better job of targeting them. Larry: students is where I had a direct data point, but people outside the narrow world of film studios in our projects, they may not know we have activities. | Karen taking over D&amp;I leadership responsibilities, academia / students will be “top of mind” | . | . | General Updates . | Rename project lifecycle stage ‘Adopted’ to ‘Graduated’ #999 . | Larry: Orthogonal to whether the project is already “widely adopted” in the industry. | Carol: last time we argued if “graduated” is the right word. But we would like to move forward with this. | Eric: also can’t think of a different word. | . | Propose to remove vote for annual reviews #1016 . | Larry: go on the assumption a project will renew at current stage, unless a problem is identified and the TAC needs to tackle it and help the project get back on track. | Carol: we wouldn’t vote unless a project needs to change stage. No vote needed to stay at a current stage. | Larry: assumes that TAC members feel they can call out if they feel project is at the wrong stage or if there are issues / areas that need to be remedied. | Larry: we will send these to LFX | . | Carol: we are preferring LFX votes instead of “live in the room” votes, that’s been on purpose. | John: any concerns? Alexander: no concerns, would be good to have this written down so it’s clear “when we do what”, for instance in person vs LFX votes. Carol: it’s our intention to be clearer about which we do, not sure when do we need to do an in person vote. Eric: what’s the motivation for online? Carol: for people who miss the meeting, also feel comfortable saying something different. Larry: motivation seems rushed to have a presentation / air an issue and have a vote right away 2 minutes before end of the meeting. Not enough time to consider the issue / do any research. Carol: we should put in documentation that for new projects we would have a TAC meeting after the presentation, and only then got to LFX vote to have time to discuss. | . | Larry: will send to the TAC channel links to spreadsheets about engineering contributions from their organizations . | build matrix with versions of projects in use, allows projects to know what they need to support | engineering contribution matrix where we ask the member companies which projects are critical to you and which projects are you putting in substantial contributions | Trying to see if these are in balance and if any projects are starved for resources. Spreadsheets haven’t been updated in a while, mostly from last year. So please have someone from your org or project update these so we can do an annual assessment. | Read-only links, first tab of spreadsheet has editable links . | Google Doc | contributionmatrix.aswf.io redirect | . | . | Dev Days 2025 - Olga . | We want to increase participation, targeting both junior and senior devs | important that projects are fully set up before event | issues must be labeled with Help Wanted so they show up on Clotributor web site | issues must be open, unassigned and opened in the last year | Look at the project guidelines page on Confluence | Carol: LF Clotributor filter to ASWF . | This is what we point people to if they want to find issues for Dev Days | Tagging with Help Wanted is the minimum to show up, can add other tags like Good First Issue. Clotributor doesn’t show every tag, only the ones it is familiar with. You can look at how projects are using tags. We’ve used Good First Issue to bring in new developers, but some people may not be new to Open Source but just new to your project, so just having Help Wanted is helpful. | There is a time limit, if you haven’t updated an issue in a year, it will drop off Clotributor to keep issues “fresh”. | OCIO has tons of older than 1yr issue, they would need to be refreshed. | Larry: are there recommended tags for the “good first issue for experience contributor”, not sure we have to have a uniform label across all projects? Carol: open to ideas, don’t want to enforce something across projects. We’d like to hear if something works well for a project. Larry: MaterialX doing a great job to “keep issues in the hopper”, they had the most contributors in the last Dev Days. | . | Carol: reminder to tag issues with labels, and tag PRs with devdays25 label (this is documented in Confluence). At org level this allows us to track what PRs were submitted as part of Dev Days. We’ll do the work of separating Spring and Fall PRs. | Any tricks for repos in order orgs like DPEL org? John: it should be, we’re careful to track every repo due to GitHub API issues. If not showing up, let us know and we may need to add manually. Matthew: OpenVDB also just moved to their own org. How often does it update? John: not sure, but seems to show up quickly? Carol: maybe 2 hours? | Carol: curious about projects moving to own org? Matthew: for DPEL we thought every project might get its own DPEL, and clearly affiliated with DPEL. For OpenVDB they are adding NanoVDB, NerfVDB. Ken: that’s correct, also some of the projects are a staging ground and may have different governance. TSC focuses on core project, and have incubation platform for some of the other projects. Matthew: works from administrative standpoint, ASWF is an Enterprise in GitHub and can “own” multiple orgs, so billing / runners works. But there are corner cases like Clotributor. Carol: yes was concerned about discoverability. If we allow / encourage projects to move to their own org, still want to make sure captured by Clotributor. John: we also have many projects using Clotributor, and sometimes we hit GitHub API limits. Shouldn’t be an issue for ASWF, there are other foundations that have a lot more repos. | Carol: DevDays is a month away, want everyone to be excited about it. Same approach as in the spring: if you are an ASWF project, you are participating in Dev Days, output depends on how easily people can be onboarded, and how much effort projects put into it. It can take resources to do these projects, if you need help reach out to us, we’ll be happy to help. | Olga: please do ask if you have questions. | . | Eric: was there an announcement for OpenQMC vote? John: yes, the vote was approved, but we may have missed sending to Slack. Josh: thank you for the help, excited to be at the incubation stage? Carol: we have to find a new thing to ask Eric at every meeting . | John: we will present OpenLensIO at next meeting. | . ",

Next TSC meeting is right after TAC call. If someone wants to come say hi! | . | . | . | Question . | Larry: great presentation for first (or 10th!) time. Curious about camera database, do you see camera manufacturers supplying the data? Anton: I don’t know. From my understanding that seems unlikely. Kimball: right. Likely path is to provide how to measure it, it’s not that expensive to put together the equipment. The manufacturers have the data, but they don’t typically publish it, and have shown resistance to doing that in the past. | Michael B: how is that different than the white paper you have to publish for ACES? Carol: you are going back another step. The IDTs for ACES come from the camera native space, whereas the camera sensitivities are in the full raw. | Carol: pip install helps make it easier for people to use it. | Larry: you don’t need to know the internals of a project to build Python bindings / wheel generation, those are things that people who know these things can help without being rawtoaces experts | . | . | Annual Review: Open Review Initiative #436 . | Reschuled for October 1st | . | OpenTrackIO #603 . | Presentation Slides | The 3 james . | James Uren, Mos-Sys Engineering | Jim Geduldick, VFX/VP supervisor | Jim Helman, Movielabs | . | Presented to TAC about a year ago, was new to Open Source, I’m a dev by training, but first attempt at building something community based | Working on OpenTrackIO in context of SMPTE RIS (Rapid Industry Solutions) group | Agenda . | Background . | Development and current state of OpenTrackIO | . | Proposal . | Transition of the software associated with OpenTrackIO to ASWF | . | SMPTE and RIS | . | Virtual Production . | On-set VP is an umbrella term for real-time VFX spanning . | Augmented Reality (AR) | Chroma Key (live broadcast and simul-cam for on-set VFX previz) | In-Camera VFX (ICVFX), eXtended Reality (XR for LED set extensions), other Mixed Reality (MR) combinations | . | VP requires live accurate camera tracking and lens modelling metadata to align the real world with the virtual every frame . | In traditional VFX often done with match moving | . | . | Problem . | Wild West VP : before OpenTrackIO, no open standard for VP metadata existed, resulting in many different communication protocols needing to be wrangled on-set and post | Metadata Producers : in the absense of any standard, lens, camera and tracking system manufacturers develop and maintain their own bespoke protocols | Metadata Consumers: real-time render engins and post-production tools must support multiple protocols | Adoption: software tools and reference implementations are required to encourage wide adoption by producers and consumer | The RIS group had a project for camera metadata (CamDKit), figure out what is important in metadata, don’t want to collect large amount of unnecessary information. Experts must determine the useful data to capture at various points in the production pipeline. | RIS had a spreadsheet list of database types, types of data that are important. Trying to coin “meta metadata”, aka “metadata about metadata”. | Separate metadata producers from metdata consumers | Have seen up to 16 different standards on a single set. Can end up with multiple formats, yet all these devices are mostly trying to do the same thing. | We need to define a standard (done, first version defined) | Encourage adoption by bringing in software components | . | Current Status . | OpenTrackIO is an open standard for real-time on-set virtual production metadata | It was developed by the SMPTE RIS OSVP group and V1 published in Jan 2025 | Spec at OpenTrackIO web site | Spec and associated web page is generated by RIS’s CamDKit | OpenTrackIO uses the OpenLensIO mathematical model, also developed by SMPTE RIS members | Camera tracking is only half the problem, need to know lens parameters to render (near)pixel accurate graphics | Lenses are all different, they have tolerances, need calibration procedures | People do this in different ways, but with the same purpose | Have produced a white paper of what is required of a lens by VP | OpenTrackIO support is available in Unreal Engine 5.6 (released June 2025). Also OpenLensIO going into 5.7 | Protocol being implemented by Canon, Sony, Mo-Sys, Pixtope, Stage Precision, Disguise, Chaos Arena, and maybe more! | Demonstrated at Unreal Fest last month | This is a “real thing”, required by industry | . | Solution . | Define the Standard . | Industry experts define what is required and how it should be implemented | . | Documentation | Open Software Tools | Reference Implementations | . | Proposal . | Create an open-source space . | For libraries, tools and reference implementations | . | Initial contributions (confirmed) . | SMPTE RIS will migrate their Python API, exmaples and generator tools to this space. Mo-Sys will migrate their C++ API and Pixotope their OpenLensIO reference implementation for image generation. | . | Expected Contributions . | Epic’s OpenTrackIO Live Sender too. Mo-Sys’s OpenTrackIO simulator. | . | Future Contributions . | Improved OpenLensIO reference implementation and shader. OpenLensIO lens calibration library (would still need tweaking on site, but still a big benefit). OpenTimelineIO integrations. USD camera integrations. Possible crossovers with existing projects. | . | . | Relationship with SMPTE . | Maintenance and extensions to specification require the involvement of a quorum of industry experts. Updates to the standard are infrequence and clearly versioned. | By contrast, tools and reference implementations are more agile with multiple contributors constantly creating and updating tools. Maintenance and code review are managed via issues and pull requests. Automated Ci/CD help to maintain code quality and application stability. | SMPTE RIS group continues to maintain the OpenTrackIO specs. | SMPTE RIS migrates the tools and examples to ASWF that have been created during the development of the spec | … | . | SMPTE . | Define the standard | Documentation | . | ASWF . | Open Software Tools | Reference Implementations | . | Summary . | OpentrackIO is a big step forward for interoperability in VP. To support its growth and expand adoption, it needs a home for developers to access tools and resources | . | Documentation is auto generated from repo, a JSON based protocol, modern and sensible . | Also has link to math paper on lens characterization, a “practical lens model” | Aspects not covered in OpenCV like vignetting | CamDKit under BSD 3-clause | . | Have had conversations with multiple camera manufacturers about implementation of OpenTrackIO / OpenLensIO . | Cannon are working closely with us, will show an OpenLensIO integration at IBC | On engine side, there’s a lot of interest in implementing this, currently a drop down box with multiple protocols to support | . | Eric R: great work, not an easy problem to solve. You hinted interest in USD, defining a JSON schema. What would be the carrier format? If you are recording to a camera card for instance? . | Trying to solve the problem of transmission at first, so a transmission protocol, but the blobs of data can be stored as files, can store a blob of JSON per frame, could be referenced from OTIO. To containerize this, we want to provide guidelines for RTP and SMPTE 2110 containerizing for transmission. | Michael Min: we discussed whether OTIO would be the carrier for this data? Eric R: I lean more towards referencing another format. James U: think of it like an audio / video stream, each JSON (frame) blob is timecoded / PTP stamped and can be referenced from a timeline (like reference clips). | Eric R: for sampling frequency, what are you seeing people want this? Some metadata can be up to 600Hz? James U: each packet is connected to a specific frame, but can timestamp at any time. But normal mode is to match the frame rate. But currently can’t support multiple streams at different rates in the same package. Kimball: I want 150FPS camera metadata! Michael B: Vicom trakcs at 300 Hz. | James U: to achieve best quality, want to sync shutter of sampling system with camera shutter, eventually will use PTP to make sure you “expose” at the same instant. But a lot of tracking systems don’t do that, especially less expensive ones don’t have sync and just fire out data, sometimes at a high rate to mitigate accuracy. OpenTrackIO supports all that. | Eric R: Cooke lens metadata standard, how does it map? James U: maps with some simple scaling, also OpenCV. Cooke on RIS committee. Some Cooke data is proprietary. Haven’t yet dabbled in full anamorphic models. | Jim G: there’s the Cooke API, and the implementation, some manufacturers reorder data fields. Michael Min: Alex Mini and Alexa do it differently. | Michael Min: 150Hz Cooke metadata resampled to 24FPS is unreliable? | Carol: we all agree this is useful and needed. We will consider inclusion as a sandbox project? John: yes, that’s the entry point. They need to put together a project propose. Carol: we like to give TAC members a couple of weeks to discuss and review. From your previous presentations, looks like you’ve done a ton of work, what makes sense with ASWF. We’ve had ACES coming over, standards and specs vs code, so we now have more expertise. | Jim U: thank you for opportunity to present, looking forward to opportunity. | . | . | . ",

David: out of scope, we had a separate initiative initially, OpenFileIO, based on OIIO, but a separate project. So OpenAssetIO is not a filesystem abstraction. But OpenFileIO as an additional project would make sense. | Michael: origin story for some efforts came from efforts at Autodesk to get open asset model and library manager as open source. Initial larger scope was to have open asset model open sourced, have an abstraction of an asset schema, and the file I/O aspect as well. Foundry then took the baton for a specific part of it. | There’s a specification for an OpenAsset spec for describing groups of files. | Michael: is there consideration of using Adobe file format plugins as an abstraction for file types? A lot of USD conversions are looking at this? Robert: wouldn’t this flow through an AR2 plugin? We have some internal copies of the Adobe extension, it should be possible to give that a spin. David: OpenAssetIO communicates a URL and mime file type. | John: when would you want to move from Sandbox to Incubation? Robert: input from TAC would be important. We would like to have the incubation label. We take the feedback of needing a larger community? We want to take the guidance from TAC, but we would like to move to incubation. John: incubation stage requirements | Larry: maybe a goal for next annual review would be to go for a promotion, feels like it would be mature enough? | David: what would prevent incubation “right now”? Larry: nothing, if you want to go for that. Would like to look at the checklist and how close you are? But you guys weren’t sure you wanted to ask for this today? But if you are ready to go now, you can tell us how far you are on each item? Carol: from checklist in the slides, seems everything is there? Seems like you’ve done a lot of hard work, maybe we could nitpick, but there’s not a hard and fast rule. You have momentum, you have some adoption with some key partners, which is the hardest hump to get over. So if you are willing to go, let’s do it. Robert: Larry made point that some projects had large in-studio communities before joining the ASWF, so they had a “captive audience”, whereas OpenAssetIO is a from scratch project. Carol: this is why I’m looking at this differently, you have made a lot of project in a short time, your report had more progress than I knew / expected. Sandbox isn’t a place to be forever, don’t want to rush anyone who isn’t ready, but if you are ready, let’s do it. | Larry: maybe that step helps you get over the hump of adoption, you get a bit more publicity, and maybe some people see the sandbox level and think it’s still experimental? We discourage people from thinking rigidly about these labels, but maybe it will help? Also there are projects that every end user will touch, and some projects are more specialized, doesn’t make it less important. So it’s not about the number of “users” or “stars on GitHub”, that’s not how we measure things. It can be narrowly appealing yet very important. | John: if you want to discuss this at TSC level, but if you want we can do a LFX vote from your request. David: double check the link on the slide? Carol: if you already checked with TSC, then just say “go”. David: we will check. Carol: then reach out to us and we’ll get it done. | . | . | Annual Review: DPEL #472 . | Matthew Low, chair of DPEL | Presentation Slides | Definition . | A library of digital assets that demonstrate the scale and complexity of modern feature film production. | Curated by the ASWF, available free to researchers and developers | Main deliverables are the assets | Provide uniform legal agreement, vetted by ASWF legal | Provide a website to host the documents and promote the assets. | Two major assets this year . | OpenPBR Shader Playground . | Contributed by Adobe | Additional contributions from NVIDIA | Novel aspects of OpenPBR Surface | OpenPBR nodes within MaterialX documents (1.39) referenced into OpenUSD scene (0.25.5) | ACES 2.0, OpenColorIO, OpenEXR | . | Sole Mates - HDR production example . | Contributed by Netflix Animation Studios | Complete 61-frame compositing package | Includes HDR render layers, Nuke script, and media | Created using DPEL NAS ALab Asset | ACES 2.0, OpenCOlorIO, OpenEXR | Potentially interesting to other projects (ORI, OTIO, …) | 3rd contribution from Netflix Animation Studio | . | Future Assets: ASC StEM v3 . | Reference material for Virtual Production / ICVFX | From ASC Join Committee on Virtual Production | Mix of 2D &amp; 3D assets | Contributions from numerous studios | Shooting at Amazon Studios Los Angeles in October | Callout to David Morin, chair of VP committee | . | . | Download Statistics . | Evaluate on downloads rather than contributions | Overview of downloads per week over last week | First full year of download data (truncations issues last year) | Estimated on number of downloads and asset sizes | 9000 downloads, 150 downloads per week | Expected peaks and troughs, holidays, conferences | Some unexpected spikes, like OTIO assets | Only tracks downloads from S3 buckets, not the ones fully on GitHub, looking to track those as well | Sizable assets: ASC StemV2 is 4TB | . | DPEL Asset Downloads . | ALab most downloaded (4000), ASC StEM2 is next | Sole mates is only 141 but has only been up for a month | . | Seeing reasonable growth from last year, but that had truncated data | . | Challenges and Opportunities (2024) . | Note a source code project | Contributions are substantial and singular | Lower engagement, collaboration and TSC stability | . | TSC . | Matthew Low, DreamWorks | Ben Fischler, Autodesk, USC product owner | Darin Grant, Netflix Animation Studios | Eric Enderton, NVIDIA | … | . | TSC Participation up to 75% for members, but also get 4-6 non members per meeting, happy to have external participation | GitHub for Asset Hosting . | Enable greater discoverability and collaboration | More readable, explorable, linkage | Better documentation with GitHub Pages | Encourage contributions | Best for assets restructured into smaller text files | 19 contributors, some projects are much larger, but first time we can engage with external contributors this way, happy to see growth | Represents first contributions from people outside TSC members or original asset creators | Contributions spiked in run up to SIGGRAPH 2025, would like to see this more normalized in coming years. | 113 active contributors, 68 organizations: great diversity of activity | . | CLOTributor &amp; Dev Days . | Some listed as Good First Issue to take part in Dev Days | Our issues cover S3 assets, as well as ideas for scripts / tooling | . | ASWF Collaborations . | OpenPBR Shader Playground: reference for OpenPBR implementations | USDWG: promote the USD Publish guidelines.

    "content": ". | General Updates . | Dev Days - September 25th #1134 | John: seemed like a lot of action? | Carol: would like to hear any hot takes. Was busier than we thought it would be given low level of communication. Got PRs in projects we hadn’t gotten PRs for. No stats yet, still have PRs rolling in. There was a post event survey, not just for people who submitted PRs, but also for project leads and companies which participated. Use this to give us written feedback, what you would see next time, what you liked / didn’t like this time. | . | Pull in TAC Overview into main TAC website #1151 . | Some minor edits from Eric Enderton | John: any issues? Carol: haven’t looked at it yet, will approve in the next day | John: we’ll merge it by end of week | . | Annual Review: Open Review Initiative #436 . | Presentation Slide Deck | Erik Strauss | . | Establish structure for projects to distribute binaries #1157 . | John: Binary Distribution for LF Hosted Projects | Typical release for a project is source code, that source code is integrated in downstream projects distributed in binary form. | What is a binary distribution? . | A binary distribution is a distribution of the code project of the project in a compiled, machine-readable form, that is designed for direct execution. | Examples: . | .exe, .app, or .o file | Python wheel | . | Not considered a binary: . | .rpm, .deb, .zip or .tar files | . | . | Why a separate binary distribution entity? . | You need binary distribution entities that have a EULA, legal separation from the developers (so you’re not in the path of liability if something goes wrong), a commercial legal entity that can transact with app stores and application certificate providers, and because software distribution direct to end users is far more complex than having a URL on GitHub | Generally, most open source projects do not distribute binaries directly, instead letting downstream vendors do so, mostly due to the above complexities | OSS licenses may not apply well to binaries, like the Apache 2 license grant a license to any patents in the source code, but doesn’t say anything about a binary blob. Eric: not sure I understand why the liability is greater when a binary is involved? John: the binary includes code that doesn’t come from the project, system libraries, code from other projects. So not just distributing the project code, the binary includes more. Eric: is that where the complexity comes from? John: when downloading from a commercial vendor, there’s a EULA involved. Carol: and that usually includes third party dependencies and disclaimers. John: which is different than an open source license. Also if distributing through an app store, there are potential certificate providers which adds levels of complexity. So you are adding “additional bits” which are outside the scope of what an open source project is typically set up to handle. | Carol: it’s not just an issue of liability, it’s also about a separation of concerns between different licenses, making things “above board”. I don’t anticipate a lot of problems. We need the proper licenses to cover the right things. | John: we want to put as little burden on projects as possible, we need to do setup on our side. | JF: aswf-docker is definitely affected. John: we need a separate legal entity to encapsulate those works. Want to make sure we have the right license. It’s not hard for LF to set up, but for projects we need to figure out how to scope this. We had done this for OTIO initially, but other projects potentially need to do this. Should we have an ASWF-wide one rather than per project entities. Would it make sense to have a general binary entity? LF recommendation is usually to have only one. | . | Direct binary distribution process . | If a project wishes to directly distribute binaries, the following MUST be put in place: . | Establish a separate location where binaries will be distributed . | MUST be separate from the project - different domain name, GitHub Org, web host, email address, etc | Binaries MUST NOT be distributed in the GitHub repo or other project-owned accounts / services | . | . | . | EULA Template . | No responsibility | List of licenses included in the binary | . | Example - Zowe | Distribution through other services . | The binary entity MUST be used for distributing binaries through other services, such as PyPI, VS Code Marketplace, JetBrains MarketPlace, and more. Key considerations: . | The account that owns the listing on the service MUST be owned by the binary entity | Any contact for the ownership account emails MUST go to the binary entity domain. | . | . | Services requiring additional provisions for projects . | Some services require additional provisions for projects . | Apple Developer Program, used for distributing through the Apple App Store or providing signed binaries for macOS | Microsoft Hardware Program | . | . | Establish a binary entity for distribution . | It’s a best practice for distribution of binaries is to have a dedicated legal entity for such activities… | . | Questions? . | Should we have one or many entities? Michael Min: what are the “border walls” around responsibility? Do we disclaim everything? How does that funnel into the project? John: people can raise issues with the project directly? Micheal Min: would the binary point back to the project GitHub? How do we link back? John: I can follow up what’s the best way to redirect people back to the project. | Carol: I vote for a single entity for binaries, we already have a similar thing with PyPI, unless a specific project really needs something different if they ask for it. But the default should be for one. | Michael Johnson: a version of the review tools which got the ProRes SDK from Apple, has to be an entity that gets granted that right, can’t redistribute the sdk, but the binary. A binary distribution entity could sign for such an agreement? John: a binary distribution entity can sign for this without adding liability for the project. | . | John: we will run an LFX vote, have been talking to OTIO, ORI. Erik: we can follow up offline. We want to identify subset of libraries compatible with our licenses, turning into a per platform matrix, we need to work with you to make sure we are doing this right. | . | Annual Review: Open Review Initiative #436 . | Presentation Slides | Erik Strauss - Annual Review for Open Review Initiative . | A collection of individual projects that have similar aims and objectives to help review media in VFX and Animation | . | TSC has grown: new representatives from WDAS, SPI, AWS, WDI | Key achievements in the past year . | 2025 deliverables . | Spec for OTIO based annotation exchange / persistence | Demo of OTIO based live synced annotations between arbitrary players | A new website with all 6 projects and areas for demo videos etc | . | AWSF Project Collaboration . | OpenAPV testing and cross collaboration . | TWO ORI TSC members now OpenAPV TSC members | . | Cross-collab on ML-WG as first target is review based tooling and potential future RPA plugin candidate | . | . | Key Achievements for OpenRV . | Annotation improvements . | New Hold &amp; Ghost (Onion skinning) | Clear annotations on all frames | . | Graphics Capabilities . | Native ProRes support for Apple Silicon Mac (Hardware decoding) | BMD SDI output for 47.95/48/120 fps | High-DPI displays | Canon raw 3 file type | . | Performance improvements . | 18x faster playlist loading | Faster H2JTK | OCIOIPNode - 2x speedup | . | Misc . | VFX Reference Platform CY2024 | Qt6 | Native Apple Silicon | XCode 16 | . | . | Contributions to OpenRV . | Active contributors: 67 | Forks: 63 | Org contributors . | Autodesk | Lots of others | . | 2064 commits | Issues resolution: avg 22 days | PR: 244 | A very healthy project, lots of user engagement, discussion chat always very busy | Autodesk remains committed to OpenRV being the base for their commercial projects, which adds commercial codecs + support | Autodesk leveraging work on sync in other systems, sync between RV and web player in Flow. | . | X-Studio Achievements . | xSTUDIO v1.0.0 released! . | Complete overhaul of UI . | Switch to new UI middleware, caused public repo to be stale / out of sync for a few months | . | Multi-track timeline . | Big differentiator with OpenRV | If your workflow is based around editorial style reviews, for instance WDAS where editors drive reviews, as opposed to being playlist oriented. | . | fully cross platform | refreshed user documentation | lots of new features | Many under-the-hood improvements | . | . | Contributions to x-Studio . | 29 active contributors | 27 forks | Most of the contributions from DNeg since this is a “brand new” project release, not that many commits to public repo, this will change going forward. | . | Key achievements for Encoding . | Fleshed out an editorial page, with a number of community contributions | Added pages for MJPEG, HEVC, AV1, VP9 and VP8 encoding | Created an HDR Encoding Guide | Created a whitepaper to encourage industry usage of VP8, VP9 and AV1 rather than HEVC | Profiled two new choses for Interframe codecs: . | OpenAPV - Advanced Professional Video Codec | HTJ2K - JPEG2000 - High-Throughput JPEG2000 | . | Project is mature and going well | Small contribution: 3 contributors, mostly Sam, but other contributors with knowledge of encoding. | Not that much code is being written here, mostly test suite and pages. | . | Launch of RPA (Review Plugin API) . | Official Release of the RPA project for the Shared Platform Repository . | Shared plugin API . | Multiple sample plugins inclusive of color correction, playlist management and more | . | . | The goal of RPA is to eventually build a community space with OSS plugins available to download and use | Useful for the broader ecosystem of users. | Still very nascent, 5 year goal would be to have a repository of plugins that could be downloaded and installed | A good place for the community to share their experience and workflows inside that ecosystem, and an opportunity to draw users and devs into this space. Both xStudio and OpenRV are complex pieces of software with a high barrier to entry for external contributions. We don’t really have a good place to take a first step to contribute to the community. | Launched at SIGGRAPH with a collection of sample plugins which describe how RPA works. | Contributions: 10 contributors, Sony, WDI | . | Things that might happen next year . | An open source drawing library added to the project . | One of our contributor studios to work on a potential future contribution of a drawing library for review tools | . | Downloadable binaries for OpenRV and X-Studio . | Need to test in a studio when you can’t built your own, even if limited on included codecs. | . | Extension of the OTIO based collaboration protocol . | Interop offline and online | . | Becoming a real boy… . | We need a TAC vote on moving us from sandbox status to incubation… | . | . | Areas the project could use help on . | Users still desperate for downloadable binaries | Licensing rights for 3rd party codecs continue to be the barrier to binary distributions . | We are currently generating a bespoke per-OS matrix… | . | . | Questions . | Carol: are you happy to stay as an “umbrella” when moving to incubation? It made sense to have an umbrella project in a sandbox, but it’s something to think about when moving to incubation? Erik: we are likely under-represented in the TAC because of our umbrella nature, the conversation about centralizing vs de-centralizing is around the mission of the umbrella initiative. We want exchange and cross collaboration between projects. Do we think we have enough alignment between the projects to continue down that path. Will that continue if the projects “spin off”, or do we pull all the projects together “in the same room” still? Carol: we don’t have to answer this today, and it’s not either / or. I think ORI is amazing, sandbox nature lets you spin up new ideas. Maybe ORI continues to be a sandbox project, and we bump up xStudio / OpenRV as incubation projects? Erik: this is great feedback. Christopher: is there inspiration from USD WGs? One group with sub groups, lots of work to coordinate. Erik: there may be an opportunity to structure things along those lines, even if OpenRV / xStudio become their own separate projects? John: ML WG also arriving in that place. Carol: similar for OCIO. | Michael B Johnson: from public perspective, OpenRV has shown a lot of progress, whereas xStudio progressed differently. So from a public open source perspective, OpenRV seems “ready”, xStudio less? Erik: Autodesk is a commercial product company which knows how to build software, whereas DNeg is a VFX company (Michael: not a judgement!). Challenge to get “product mindset” for xStudio. Open Source Community can get you that help. Michael: so do you want to move the whole thing to the next level and keep them together? Carol: we should bring discussion to Slack before we bring it to a vote, or have another discussion at next TAC meeting. We can look at the different components in ORI and consider them for incubation. There is a lot of value to keeping them together, that’s been successful. The encoding project is great, but may not be a project on its own. We could also deal with this when projects are ready to graduate. Erik: will want to engage the individual TSCs to see how they feel about it. Encoding Guidelines is closer to DPEL to a software project for instance, even though it does have some code. | . | . | .

Do we want to focus on only ASWF projects or other open source projects. | . | . | . | Q&amp;A . | Christopher Moore: did we canvas on familiarity? Carol: projects have to have “good first issues” and build process documented. We recommend that people build the project before the event so they are ready to complete the task on the day instead of spending the day building. We still have people who spend all day building the project, maybe first time using CMake, contributing to an OS project. We still count this is as a win, even if we don’t get a PR. We count PRs over the following week, so even if they were blocked on the day of, we can count follow on PRs. | Larry: we try hard to explain that there’s a strong correlation between people who were able to build ahead of time and finish the task on the day. Most people have been getting the message. Also unreasonable to expect that the work gets merged on the day. Even a skilled developer may require a couple of review cycles. Even if it takes a couple more days, it’s part of the process. Adding something else to consider. we’ve grappled with the tension between trying to recruit people entirely new to our projects / ASWF, vs people in our companies but haven’t touched our project. These are different audiences. We shouldn’t consider solely on one or the other, we would need feedback on that. | Cary: I was out for most of September so wasn’t able to have OpenEXR join. We have framed this event as an introductory event for junior programmers. For OpenEXR I struggle to find issues accessible to people like that. Is there an alternate effort focussing on the larger things a project needs, targeting more senior people who haven’t contributed before, instead of smaller things that benefit the individuals. | Larry: at Imageworks we had a team do a somewhat larger task, hand’t tried it before, it was quite successful. The team effort made it more interesting / fun. Working together they could take a bigger bite out of the task. It was successful, a way for companies to turn it into a collaborative event. | Cary: someone at ILM is working on a feature extension to EXR, it’s not his primary job, so he’s “noodling away at it”. So a Dev Days event where someone like that could concentrate on that? Carol: last time you gave this feedback, we took it into consideration, adjusted our wording, presentations. Not sure we took a large uptake, but we are taking it into consideration. It really does take concrete ideas. Should we bring it back to 48h for more “meaty” tasks? Would love to see more senior devs in companies have exposure to multiple projects, and be exposed to something that’s not part of their day jobs. | Olga: we are also encouraging senior devs to join. | Matthew Low: we had two contributors at Dreamworks who had done internal dev for Rez caching, now is the right time to contribute back work that had been mostly done before. Also an OpenRV contribution. So it’s a good way to encourage contribution to Dev Days, but also more regular contribution. Part of challenge is on the rep of the company to be the evangelist, last time Montana had made a post mortem at Animal Logic. From companies who were successful, what are you doing internally to recruit participants? | Larry: cookies was the secret! Olga: I took charge at Imageworks, we had Dev Days cookies printed across the 3 locations. David: but they were so nice you didn’t want to eat them! Olga: we did internal promition at SPI, but also someone senior said it was important to join, and it’s OK not to work on your normal responsibilities. Otherwise Dev Days can feel like an “extra task” you can’t concentrate on. Backing from senior management really helped. Had 4 people working on MaterialX project. | JC: Has it been considered to maybe collect success stories and publish them somewhere? This could maybe entice companies to participate more. Olga: we have blogs posts, but we need company leadership to distribute the info. Carol: We have published a few blogs, but I agree, more focused case studies would be good. | Kimball: in previous years I had to “beg” people, this year a bunch of people self motivated, so a good outcome, people didn’t see it as an onerous task, they wanted to do it. Olga: we hope it becomes a self sustaining event so we don’t need to promote it as much. Carol: it may feel slow, but this is just our 4th Dev Days in the 3rd year. Progress in the chart and combining 2025 events is showing growth. | Carol: can’t talk about Dev Days without talking about how much effort Olga and Montana have put in, both at ASWF level and within their companies. But they are volunteers, we would like new volunteers, at least 1 or 2 people in the TAC (separate from Carol / Larry). Just commit for 2026! It can be hard to sign up for open ended commitment, if you have time to help us on the committee, please reach out! We need to respect Olga and Montana’s time so it’s not all on them. We get support from Linux Foundation, but they are also stretched thin. Olga: if there’s someone at your company, it doesn’t have to be a TAC member, we’ll appreciate help from anyone who volunteers. Carol: of course, but would like 1-2 other volunteers from the AC. | . | . | Carol: already October, so looking for TAC vice chair who will work with me, as I will be replacing Larry as TAC chair. 2 year commitement, vice chair the first year, then chair the second year. Lots of “talking” on the meetings, but also working behind the scenes with David, John, the Board, making sure we keep priorities in order, the TAC meetings are running well, following up on issues. We’re getting better at doing this, have made progress on how to run the TAC. If you are interested, please reach out, otherwise we’ll nominate people! Larry: whoever volunteers will have a great time, Carol is a great organizer and she will “show you the ropes”. It’s not a forever commitment! Carol: reach out to me directly. | David: thank you Olga and Montana, Dev Days is on a growth curve, we’re there for the long term. A lot of the discussions here make a lot of sense, for instance Cary’s feedback. We are looking forward to the next Dev Days. Also “thank you Larry!” even though still TAC chair. Working with Larry and Carol is great, TAC is at the core of ASWF, which is there to support the TAC. Discussions with Carol and Larry about projects and the ASWF have been great, we have a lot of potential to achieve, in an industry in challenging times. How can we take incremental steps to achieve results. Looking forward to working with Carol and the new Vice Chair. Larry, you have to remain involved! Larry: we borrowed approach from DigiPro, they also have previous chairs as an “advisory board”, happy to be available for something like that. | . ",

They need a bit of time, they’ve been asked to regroup among themselves and decide. We should check in wih them though, but may take some time. | John: do we want to skip the TAC meeting Wednesday before TG holiday? Lots of people skip, let’s skip it. We also have Dec 24, so we should probably skip that as well. | . | . | Annual Review: Zero Trust Working Group #621 . | Daryll Strauss | Presentation Slides | This working group is looking at ways of improving security in ASWF projects by allowing them to operate in zero trust environments. We will develop educational materials and best practices… | Partitipation: Adobe, Autodesk, Foundry, MovieLabs, Disney, Dreamworks, Google, AWS, would like to see more people on the vendor side. | Key Achievements in the past year . | Discussions between software vendors and studios on zero trust requirements | Discussion on commercial zero trust solutions that could meet some requirements | Identification of identity management in desktop applications, plugins, and rendering as a key issue for users, vendors and studios. Typical browser based authentication for desktop apps is awkward, especially for plugins and render. | Initial design of a proxy identity server for desktop | In process security reviews of proxy identity server | . | The Challenge . | Apps rely on OS login, which authenticates the process not the user, and doesn’t work well for network services | Network services ask the user to login to each service separately which is awkward for the user and often stores credentials locally | Apps use API keys which are awkward to setup, long lasting, difficult to track, store credentials, and are difficult to deauthorize | Doing OAuth flows in apps is awkward and requires each app to interact with a browser and embed a web server | . | Proxy Identity Server . | Step 1: User Login . | After logging into their workstation, the user uses the proxy identity server to login to the corporate identity server… | . | Step 2: Identity Request . | When a desktop application requires user authentication it requests the identity from the proxy identity server. Each desktop application provides a client secret that is used to control access to the identity. The proxy identity server can be configured to pass forward the request to a corporate authorization server to allow fine grained control of which application can request the identity. | . | Step 3: Access Request . | When the desktop application needs to access a service, they exchange the identity token for the service’s access token. The service must validate the identity token by checking the signature. Once validated the service returns an access token that is used by the desktop application to access the service. | . | . | Proxy Identity Server . | The Benefits . | Apps don’t need to deal with SSO flows, just REST calls | Users only login once for multiple apps | Users can have different versions of their identity (eg to work on different shows) | Organizations control which apps can access which services | Identity tokens and access tokens can be short lived | . | . | Areas the project could use help on . | We are moving from early design documents to more formal requirements. Additional review of the designs and requirements would be helpful… | . | Feedback on working with ASWF . | We appreciate the high quality members we have working with our group which would have been more difficult otherwise | . | Open Discussion . | Eric Reineke: have you been able to try these flows with practical examples? Daryll: we are only addressing identity, exchanging an identity with an access token. Eric: that aspect would be working with AWS. Daryll: yes, vendors are interested, they already do similar things. | JF: any other industries need this? Daryll: we’ve looked around and haven’t found it. It’s not an issue if you are fully in the SaaS world, has to be a mix of desktop and SaaS apps. Then we have rendering and plugins. The identity token has to live long enough for a render to finish! | Michael Min: any considerations around language models and janitor services. There are stories around bad actors being able to ingest tokens into models that act as administrators. Services can then go into admin mode. Is there discussion around these types of issues? Daryll: we stop at the identity part, once you have the token, you can pass it to services. But it’s a tricky problem in general. Jim Helman: could be a good future topic to address. Have discussed challenges around securing agentic AI workflows. Michael: this is not hypothetical. Jim: come join the group! | Eric R: this is about tackling workstation identity, then when I launch a job on the farm with my rights, how do I give “operating as” permissions. Daryll: SSO flow will return JWT, proxy identity server will read JWT from env var (for instance), and now your services and plugins can go to identity server. If filesystem still expects POSIX permissions, you will need a mapping service back to UNIX users. | Carol: presentation is good. After a year, expectations of a WG is not to produce code. So no pressure to produce a code deliverable, you are doing all the right things, producing documents, working with ASWF projects. Jim: in order to prove this out, can’t just do it on paper. There maybe code for a PoC, but if the PoC looks promising / useful, could eventually become a real version usable in production, then may start a sandbox project. | Eric (chat) I think the “workstation-centric” nature and pipeline composed of many applications accessing the same resources aspect our industry might be a bit more unique? I wonder if there are other fields where that happens a lot? Machine Learning researchers?

So not just one person carrying the project. | Q&amp;A . | Eric E: how do the new BSDFs relate to MaterialX? Larry: some are implementations of the BSDFs described by MaterialX, some are not in MaterialX, but we want this to be a “conversation opener”. Working code which can be iterated on. This was a big topic in last year’s tech update, since then are making effort to sync up with MaterialX. We’re trying to make it so OSL is a compliant implementation of what MaterialX specifies. | JF: any contributions outside ASWF? Larry: most contributions are from ASWF members, but we do get contributions from major renderers. Not every TSC member is a code contributor, but they are all idea contributors. OSL TSC members often spawn interesting discussion about renderer and shading technology. It’s a like a SIGGRAPH hallway discussion, the right set of people in the room, willing to get into the weeds of specific shader issues to spawn new ideas. Even though SPI does a lot of writing of OSL, we’ve learned a lot. We value the TSC members as idea generators. JF: could be a ASWF blog post? Larry: we get off on very interesting tangents. | Michael Min: is there consideration of incorporating SLANG from Nvidia? Eric: not aware of efforts to connect them. SLANG is maybe more of an implementation language like HSLS rather than a shader language. But it is differentiable, and set up for AI training. There’s no connection yet, but an interesting idea. Larry: have been following SLANG, as a successor to HLSL, it could be a no brainer to follow languages getting long in the tooth, but could be different than what we are doing in OSL? But a fresh look at the problem with new ideas, we can learn from it and adopt some new ideas, but not a concerted effort yet. | JT (chat) Differential rendering | . | . | . ",

    "content": ". | General Updates . | AGENDA TOPIC: AI code assistant policy #1195 . | Larry: we don’t have to resolve this today, but wanted to get conversation started. Dev have outside lives, they may be using code assistants for work or personal projects. We should get ahead of the topic and decide what policies we want for our projects, what are the benefits, what are the risks. Each project can make its own rules for what’s good for its community, but a set of baseline guidelines would be good to adopt. LF guidance on hard boundaries would be good as well. As a sampling of issues, most projects have CLAs and DCOs, does that cover code suggestions from coding assistants? What are the policies a project should have, there are projects out there which are being flooded by low quality PRs / bug reports that are LLM generated. Want to make sure our standards aren’t eroded and we aren’t flooded by these. Using coding assistants still means you are just as responsible. Need to have procedures set up. | John: a common topic in our foundations, we had a GenAI policy last year but not very specific. Can look at what other foundations are doing. | Larry: should the commit message say that LLM was used? | Carol: does anything have to change legally? And what do we want to do as a foundation? Bringing this up now, what is relevant to your companies, your projects, then we’ll have discussion next time. | Larry: developer team perspective on accepting those contributions, but also as a recipient, don’t want to back projects into areas where member companies may have issues with. | John: will get legal feedback. | JF: curious about how this interacts with the license chosen by a project | Larry: would like to hear about what other projects have adopted, at both ends of the spectrum. | John: will do some research, and will report back at next TAC. | Kimball (chat): Instead of DCO, need DCR signed-off-by indicator? (Developer Certified Review) | Eric Powers: By example, I attempted to use github copilot at work to analyze an open source project and generate a function based on that project, but our NBCU github copilot denied the ability to use copilot referencing this public repository. | . | Create a section of the tac repo for project best practices guides #1194 . | Larry: want to find a place to start documenting these. ALl the projects are doing their own thing, some projects have people in common / active in the TAC, some are more “islands”. We need to learn from each other. Want to write “best practices” documents, not compulsory, but a place to share. Seeded it with a document from OIIO, it got positive feedback. Also some blank documents. If a project thinks it has good practices on one of the aspects in the template documents, please submit PRs. Could be a fruitful source of information. | John: the more knowledge the better! We can then figure out how it gets into the main tac.aswf.io web site. | . | TAC Vice Chair election #1202 . | John: transition “handover of the guard”, Carol will become Chairperson, Larry will step down, looking for someone new to become vice-chair. If anyone is interested, contact Larry / Carol / John. | . | 2026 Security Reviews #1137 . | John: want to do another run in 2026. Want to prioritize Graduated Stage projects, if you are such a project and are interested, even at Incubation Stage, a spot could open up. Good opportunity to improve security posture. | . | Project Leads - License Scans just sent out #1212 . | Not all projects received them?

Anything blocking adoption stage outside of CI? Eric: we’re 90% of the way for OpenSSF badge, but don’t remember specifics. Carol: Larry was talking about TAC best practices, is there anything you need help with and we could write into best practices guide. Make sure we answer the questions you need answered. Know where you are getting stuck / out of comfort zone. | Carol: this year was crazy for everyone including OTIO, got pulled into other directions for ACES 2, but would like to prioritize color aspects. OTIO should be able to talk with OCIO so people can depend on it. That would be my wish, if this is the year you think you want to address this. Eric: Doug gave us great feedback on the proposal I wrote, a lot of my year also got eaten up by ACES 2.0! Entire color ecosystem has gotten a lot clearer. | David: with the challenges on NLE adoption outside VFX / Animation, do you know what the roadblocks are? Eric: we’ve been successful making this case, one particular NLE vendor I’ve been talking says it may depend on user base. Would be an easier sell if we could claim to have fixed the crazy timewarp / remapping problem, that would make it a more compelling case. Some of our contributors have done great work, but not in OTIO yet. A vendor can integrate OTIO, but who is going to use it. “Build it and they will come: this is demoed in Kdenlive. Clear interop path with Resolve is helpful. But are the people paying for an NLE asking for it, that drives the demand. Demand exists on the higher end for VFX / Animation, but may not be for YouTube editors for instance. | David: for the timewarp features, when do you think that could be incorporated? Eric: I can’t really say, depends on the time people have to work on them. David: do you think everyone who should know about OTIO does? Is there a visibility issue? Eric: I’m pretty “obnoxious” and talk to a lot of people, I think we have pretty good visibility, we’ve put a lot of effort in trying to get adoption. We’ve hit the large headline NLEs, something which didn’t happen this year is that we didn’t deliver the schema enhancements to demonstrate new features. So we may have “failed” as a project, we haven’t demonstrated follow-on value. Hopefully we can deliver that next year. | Carol: you had a couple of new, big integrations this year. That’s good progress! We see these cycles on a lot of these projects, a year may not be a “full cycle”. We had that in OCIO, 2024 was a smaller release, this year was a big release. So don’t be too hard on yourself! Eric: a good point. 10 years ago I would have not have dreamt of having OTIO in Media Composer! A decade of advocacy. We have high standards for ourselves! Carol: would def want to work with you to get you over the hump to graduation. And do a 1.0 release, will help with momentum, get out of “public beta” mentality. | David: we should plan a marketing campaign for 1.0 release to make sure OTIO is top of mind from every vendor. Carol: NAB good time? Eric: a good idea, we can hold a funeral for EDL. | . | . | . ",

    "content": "The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices badge allows Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they follow best practices in managing their project. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and, as a result, are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software. Academy Software Foundation projects, as a part of the project lifecycle established by the TAC, achieve this badge to showcase them being exemplars in open source for the visual effects and motion picture industries. This document outlines specific questions Academy Software Foundation projects have raised concerning fulfilling the badge requirements. If you have unanswered questions, please provide a PR that adds your question below and will be merged with an answer. | Passing . | The project website MUST succinctly describe what the software does (what problem does it solve?). | The project website MUST provide information on how to: obtain, provide feedback (as bug reports or enhancements), and contribute to the software. | The information on how to contribute MUST explain the contribution process (e.g., are pull requests used?) | The information on how to contribute SHOULD include the requirements for acceptable contributions (e.g., a reference to any required coding standard). | The software produced by the project MUST be released as FLOSS. | It is SUGGESTED that any required license(s) for the software produced by the project be approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). | The project MUST post the license(s) of its results in a standard location in their source repository. | The project MUST provide basic documentation for the software produced by the project. | The project MUST provide reference documentation that describes the external interface (both input and output) of the software produced by the project. | The project sites (website, repository, and download URLs) MUST support HTTPS using TLS. | The project MUST have one or more mechanisms for discussion (including proposed changes and issues) that are searchable, allow messages and topics to be addressed by URL, enable new people to participate in some of the discussions, and do not require client-side installation of proprietary software. | The project SHOULD provide documentation in English and be able to accept bug reports and comments about code in English. | The project MUST be maintained. | The project MUST have a version-controlled source repository that is publicly readable and has a URL. | The project’s source repository MUST track what changes were made, who made the changes, and when the changes were made. | To enable collaborative review, the project’s source repository MUST include interim versions for review between releases; it MUST NOT include only final releases. | It is SUGGESTED that common distributed version control software be used (e.g., git) for the project’s source repository. | The project results MUST have a unique version identifier for each release intended to be used by users. | It is SUGGESTED that the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) or Calendar Versioning (CalVer) version numbering format be used for releases. It is SUGGESTED that those who use CalVer include a micro level value. | It is SUGGESTED that projects identify each release within their version control system. For example, it is SUGGESTED that those using git identify each release using git tags. | The project MUST provide, in each release, release notes that are a human-readable summary of major changes in that release to help users determine if they should upgrade and what the upgrade impact will be. The release notes MUST NOT be the raw output of a version control log (e.g., the git log” command results are not release notes). Projects whose results are not intended for reuse in multiple locations (such as the software for a single website or service) AND employ continuous delivery MAY select “N/A”.” | The release notes MUST identify every publicly known run-time vulnerability fixed in this release that already had a CVE assignment or similar when the release was created. This criterion may be marked as not applicable (N/A) if users typically cannot practically update the software themselves (e.g., as is often true for kernel updates). This criterion applies only to the project results, not to its dependencies. If there are no release notes or there have been no publicly known vulnerabilities, choose N/A. | The project MUST provide a process for users to submit bug reports (e.g., using an issue tracker or a mailing list). | The project SHOULD use an issue tracker for tracking individual issues. | The project MUST acknowledge a majority of bug reports submitted in the last 2-12 months (inclusive); the response need not include a fix. | The project SHOULD respond to a majority (&gt;50%) of enhancement requests in the last 2-12 months (inclusive). | The project MUST have a publicly available archive for reports and responses for later searching. | The project MUST publish the process for reporting vulnerabilities on the project site. | If private vulnerability reports are supported, the project MUST include how to send the information in a way that is kept private. | The project’s initial response time for any vulnerability report received in the last 6 months MUST be less than or equal to 14 days. | If the software produced by the project requires building for use, the project MUST provide a working build system that can automatically rebuild the software from source code. | It is SUGGESTED that common tools be used for building the software. | The project SHOULD be buildable using only FLOSS tools. | The project MUST use at least one automated test suite that is publicly released as FLOSS (this test suite may be maintained as a separate FLOSS project). The project MUST clearly show or document how to run the test suite(s) (e.g., via a continuous integration (CI) script or via documentation in files such as BUILD.md, README.md, or CONTRIBUTING.md). | A test suite SHOULD be invocable in a standard way for that language. | It is SUGGESTED that the test suite cover most (or ideally all) the code branches, input fields, and functionality. | It is SUGGESTED that the project implement continuous integration (where new or changed code is frequently integrated into a central code repository and automated tests are run on the result). | The project MUST have a general policy (formal or not) that as major new functionality is added to the software produced by the project, tests of that functionality should be added to an automated test suite. | The project MUST have evidence that the test_policy for adding tests has been adhered to in the most recent major changes to the software produced by the project.” | It is SUGGESTED that this policy on adding tests be documented in the instructions for change proposals.” | The project MUST enable one or more compiler warning flags, a safe language mode or use a separate “linter” tool to look for code quality errors or common simple mistakes if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can implement this criterion in the selected language. | The project MUST address warnings. | It is SUGGESTED that projects be maximally strict with warnings in the software produced by the project, where practical. | The project MUST have at least one primary developer who knows how to design secure software. | At least one of the project’s primary developers MUST know of common kinds of errors that lead to vulnerabilities in this kind of software, as well as at least one method to counter or mitigate each of them. | The software produced by the project MUST use, by default, only cryptographic protocols and algorithms that are publicly published and reviewed by experts (if cryptographic protocols and algorithms are used). | If the software produced by the project is an application or library, and its primary purpose is not to implement cryptography, then it SHOULD only call on software specifically designed to implement cryptographic functions; it SHOULD NOT re-implement its own. | All functionality in the software produced by the project that depends on cryptography MUST be implementable using FLOSS. | The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST use default keylengths that at least meet the NIST minimum requirements through the year 2030 (as stated in 2012). It MUST be possible to configure the software so that smaller keylengths are completely disabled. | The default security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST NOT depend on broken cryptographic algorithms (e.g., MD4, MD5, single DES, RC4, Dual_EC_DRBG), or use cipher modes that are inappropriate to the context, unless they are necessary to implement an interoperable protocol (where the protocol implemented is the most recent version of that standard broadly supported by the network ecosystem, that ecosystem requires the use of such an algorithm or mode, and that ecosystem does not offer any more secure alternative). The documentation MUST describe any relevant security risks and any known mitigations if these broken algorithms or modes are necessary for an interoperable protocol. | The default security mechanisms within the software produced by the project SHOULD NOT depend on cryptographic algorithms or modes with known serious weaknesses (e.g., the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm or the CBC mode in SSH). | The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project SHOULD implement perfect forward secrecy for key agreement protocols so a session key derived from a set of long-term keys cannot be compromised if one of the long-term keys is compromised in the future. | If the software produced by the project causes the storing of passwords for authentication of external users, the passwords MUST be stored as iterated hashes with a per-user salt by using a key stretching (iterated) algorithm (e.g., Argon2id, Bcrypt, Scrypt, or PBKDF2). See also OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet. | The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST generate all cryptographic keys and nonces using a cryptographically secure random number generator, and MUST NOT do so using generators that are cryptographically insecure. | The project MUST use a delivery mechanism that counters MITM attacks. Using https or ssh+scp is acceptable. | A cryptographic hash (e.g., a sha1sum) MUST NOT be retrieved over http and used without checking for a cryptographic signature. | There MUST be no unpatched vulnerabilities of medium or higher severity that have been publicly known for more than 60 days. | Projects SHOULD fix all critical vulnerabilities rapidly after they are reported. | The public repositories MUST NOT leak a valid private credential (e.g., a working password or private key) that is intended to limit public access. | At least one static code analysis tool (beyond compiler warnings and safe language modes) MUST be applied to any proposed major production release of the software before its release if there is at least one FLOSS tool that implements this criterion in the selected language. | It is SUGGESTED that at least one of the static analysis tools used for the static_analysis criterion include rules or approaches to look for common vulnerabilities in the analyzed language or environment. | All medium and higher severity exploitable vulnerabilities discovered with static code analysis MUST be fixed in a timely way after they are confirmed. | It is SUGGESTED that static source code analysis occur on every commit or at least daily. | It is SUGGESTED that at least one dynamic analysis tool be applied to any proposed major production release of the software before its release. | It is SUGGESTED that if the software produced by the project includes software written using a memory-unsafe language (e.g., C or C++), then at least one dynamic tool (e.g., a fuzzer or web application scanner) be routinely used in combination with a mechanism to detect memory safety problems such as buffer overwrites. If the project does not produce software written in a memory-unsafe language, choose not applicable (N/A). | It is SUGGESTED that the project use a configuration for at least some dynamic analysis (such as testing or fuzzing) which enables many assertions. In many cases these assertions should not be enabled in production builds. | All medium and higher severity exploitable vulnerabilities discovered with dynamic code analysis MUST be fixed in a timely way after they are confirmed. | . | Silver . | The project MUST achieve a passing level badge. | The information on how to contribute MUST include the requirements for acceptable contributions (e.g., a reference to any required coding standard). | The project SHOULD have a legal mechanism where all developers of non-trivial amounts of project software assert that they are legally authorized to make these contributions. The most common and easily-implemented approach for doing this is by using a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) where users add “signed-off-by” in their commits and the project links to the DCO website. However this MAY be implemented as a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) or other legal mechanism. | The project MUST clearly define and document its project governance model (the way it makes decisions, including key roles). | The project MUST adopt a code of conduct and post it in a standard location. | The project MUST clearly define and publicly document the key roles in the project and their responsibilities, including any tasks those roles must perform. It MUST be clear who has which role(s), though this might not be documented in the same way. | The project MUST be able to continue with minimal interruption if any one person dies, is incapacitated, or is otherwise unable or unwilling to continue support of the project. In particular, the project MUST be able to create and close issues, accept proposed changes, and release versions of software, within a week of confirmation of the loss of support from any one individual. This MAY be done by ensuring someone else has any necessary keys, passwords, and legal rights to continue the project. Individuals who run a FLOSS project MAY do this by providing keys in a lockbox and a will providing any needed legal rights (e.g., for DNS names). | The project SHOULD have a bus factor of 2 or more. | The project MUST have a documented roadmap that describes what the project intends to do and not do for at least the next year. | The project MUST include documentation of the architecture (aka high-level design) of the software produced by the project. If the project does not produce software, select not applicable (N/A). | The project MUST document what the user can and cannot expect in terms of security from the software produced by the project (its security requirements). | The project MUST provide a quick start guide for new users to help them quickly do something with the software. | The project MUST make an effort to keep the documentation consistent with the current version of the project results (including software produced by the project). Any known documentation defects making it inconsistent MUST be fixed. If the documentation is generally current, but erroneously includes some older information that is no longer true, just treat that as a defect, then track and fix as usual. | The project repository front page and/or website MUST identify and hyperlink to any achievements, including this best practices badge, within 48 hours of public recognition that the achievement has been attained. | The project (both project sites and project results) SHOULD follow accessibility best practices so that persons with disabilities can still participate in the project and use the project results where it is reasonable to do so. | The software produced by the project SHOULD be internationalized to enable easy localization for the target audience’s culture, region, or language. If internationalization (i18n) does not apply (e.g., the software doesn’t generate text intended for end-users and doesn’t sort human-readable text), select not applicable (N/A). | If the project sites (website, repository, and download URLs) store passwords for authentication of external users, the passwords MUST be stored as iterated hashes with a per-user salt by using a key stretching (iterated) algorithm (e.g., Argon2id, Bcrypt, Scrypt, or PBKDF2). If the project sites do not store passwords for this purpose, select not applicable (N/A). | The project MUST maintain the most often used older versions of the product or provide an upgrade path to newer versions. If the upgrade path is difficult, the project MUST document how to perform the upgrade (e.g., the interfaces that have changed and detailed suggested steps to help upgrade). | The project MUST use an issue tracker for tracking individual issues. | The project MUST give credit to the reporter(s) of all reports resolved in the last 12 months, except for the reporter(s) who request anonymity. If there have been no vulnerabilities resolved in the last 12 months, select not applicable (N/A). | The project MUST have a documented process for responding to vulnerability reports. | The project MUST identify the specific coding style guides for the primary languages it uses, and require that contributions generally comply with it. | The project MUST automatically enforce its selected coding style(s) if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can do so in the selected language(s). | Build systems for native binaries MUST honor the relevant compiler and linker (environment) variables passed in to them (e.g., CC, CFLAGS, CXX, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS) and pass them to compiler and linker invocations. A build system MAY extend them with additional flags; it MUST NOT simply replace provided values with its own. If no native binaries are being generated, select not applicable (N/A). | The build and installation system SHOULD preserve debugging information if they are requested in the relevant flags (e.g., install -s is not used). If there is no build or installation system (e.g. typical JavaScript libraries) select not applicable (N/A). | The build system for the software produced by the project MUST NOT recursively build subdirectories if there are cross-dependencies in the subdirectories. If there is no build or installation system (e.g., typical JavaScript libraries), select not applicable” (N/A). | The project MUST be able to repeat the process of generating information from source files and get exactly the same bit-for-bit result. If no building occurs (e.g., scripting languages where the source code is used directly instead of being compiled), select not applicable (N/A). | The project MUST provide a way to easily install and uninstall the software produced by the project using a commonly-used convention. | The installation system for end-users MUST honor standard conventions for selecting the location where built artifacts are written to at installation time. For example, if it installs files on a POSIX system it MUST honor the DESTDIR environment variable. If there is no installation system or no standard convention, select not applicable” (N/A).” | The project MUST provide a way for potential developers to quickly install all the project results and support environment necessary to make changes, including the tests and test environment. This MUST be performed with a commonly-used convention. | The project MUST list external dependencies in a computer-processable way. | Projects MUST monitor or periodically check their external dependencies (including convenience copies) to detect known vulnerabilities, and fix exploitable vulnerabilities or verify them as unexploitable. | The project SHOULD avoid using deprecated or obsolete functions and APIs where FLOSS alternatives are available in the set of technology it uses (its technology stack) and to a supermajority of the users the project supports (so that users have ready access to the alternative). | An automated test suite MUST be applied on each check-in to a shared repository for at least one branch. This test suite MUST produce a report on test success or failure. | The project MUST add regression tests to an automated test suite for at least 50% of the bugs fixed within the last six months. | The project MUST have FLOSS automated test suite(s) that provide at least 80% statement coverage if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can measure this criterion in the selected language. | The project MUST have a formal written policy that as major new functionality is added, tests for the new functionality MUST be added to an automated test suite. | The project MUST include, in its documented instructions for change proposals, the policy that tests are to be added for major new functionality. | Projects MUST be maximally strict with warnings in the software produced by the project, where practical. | “The project MUST implement secure design principles (from know_secure_design) where applicable. If the project is not producing software select “not applicable” (N/A). | The default security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST NOT depend on cryptographic algorithms or modes with known serious weaknesses (e.g., the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm or the CBC mode in SSH). | The project SHOULD support multiple cryptographic algorithms, so users can quickly switch if one is broken. Common symmetric key algorithms include AES, Twofish, and Serpent. Common cryptographic hash algorithm alternatives include SHA-2 (including SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 AND SHA-512) and SHA-3. | The project MUST support storing authentication credentials (such as passwords and dynamic tokens) and private cryptographic keys in files that are separate from other information (such as configuration files, databases, and logs), and permit users to update and replace them without code recompilation. If the project never processes authentication credentials and private cryptographic keys, select not applicable” (N/A). | The software produced by the project SHOULD support secure protocols for all of its network communications, such as SSHv2 or later, TLS1.2 or later (HTTPS), IPsec, SFTP, and SNMPv3.

The private key for these signature(s) MUST NOT be on site(s) used to directly distribute the software to the public. If releases are not intended for widespread use, select not applicable” (N/A). | It is SUGGESTED that in the version control system, each important version tag (a tag that is part of a major release, minor release, or fixes publicly noted vulnerabilities) be cryptographically signed and verifiable as described in signed_releases. | The project results MUST check all inputs from potentially untrusted sources to ensure they are valid (an allowlist), and reject invalid inputs, if there are any restrictions on the data at all. | Hardening mechanisms SHOULD be used in the software produced by the project so that software defects are less likely to result in security vulnerabilities. | The project MUST provide an assurance case that justifies why its security requirements are met. The assurance case MUST include: a description of the threat model, clear identification of trust boundaries, an argument that secure design principles have been applied, and an argument that common implementation security weaknesses have been countered. | The project MUST use at least one static analysis tool with rules or approaches to look for common vulnerabilities in the analyzed language or environment, if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can implement this criterion in the selected language. | If the software produced by the project includes software written using a memory-unsafe language (e.g., C or C++), then at least one dynamic tool (e.g., a fuzzer or web application scanner) MUST be routinely used in combination with a mechanism to detect memory safety problems such as buffer overwrites.

This MAY be done by including the following inside a comment near the beginning of each file: SPDX-License-Identifier: [SPDX license expression for project] | The project’s source repository MUST use a common distributed version control software (e.g., git or mercurial). | The project MUST clearly identify small tasks that can be performed by new or casual contributors. | The project MUST require two-factor authentication (2FA) for developers for changing a central repository or accessing sensitive data (such as private vulnerability reports). This 2FA mechanism MAY use mechanisms without cryptographic mechanisms such as SMS, though that is not recommended. | The project’s two-factor authentication (2FA) SHOULD use cryptographic mechanisms to prevent impersonation. Short Message Service (SMS) based 2FA, by itself, does NOT meet this criterion, since it is not encrypted. | The project MUST document its code review requirements, including how code review is conducted, what must be checked, and what is required to be acceptable. | The project MUST have at least 50% of all proposed modifications reviewed before release by a person other than the author, to determine if it is a worthwhile modification and free of known issues which would argue against its inclusion | The project MUST have a reproducible build.

    "content": "The project website MUST succinctly describe what the software does (what problem does it solve?). For projects without a separate website, the primary GitHub repo README.md should have this information. If a project doesn’t have a separate website, but has a public GitHub or GitLab source code repository site, that repository site is the project website. The project website MUST provide information on how to: obtain, provide feedback (as bug reports or enhancements), and contribute to the software. We recommend having a separate CONTRIBUTING.md file if it’s non-trivial; if it’s trivial, it can be noted in the README.md file. The information on how to contribute MUST explain the contribution process (e.g., are pull requests used?) . We recommend having a separate CONTRIBUTING.md file if it’s non-trivial; if it’s trivial, it can be noted in the README.md file. The information on how to contribute SHOULD include the requirements for acceptable contributions (e.g., a reference to any required coding standard). We recommend having a separate CONTRIBUTING.md file if it’s non-trivial; if it’s trivial, it can be noted in the README.md file. OpenEXR’s CONTRIBUTING.md is a great example to follow. The software produced by the project MUST be released as FLOSS. This is a requirement for any project hosted in the ASWF and LF. It is SUGGESTED that any required license(s) for the software produced by the project be approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Generally, all projects at the ASWF are under an OSI-approved license. Note that the Apache-2.0 license, BSD-3 Clause License, and MIT license are OSI-approved licenses. The project MUST post the license(s) of its results in a standard location in their source repository. We recommended having this in a LICENSE file in each repository ( more details here ) . The project MUST provide basic documentation for the software produced by the project. The project MUST provide reference documentation that describes the external interface (both input and output) of the software produced by the project. The project sites (website, repository, and download URLs) MUST support HTTPS using TLS. The project MUST have one or more mechanisms for discussion (including proposed changes and issues) that are searchable, allow messages and topics to be addressed by URL, enable new people to participate in some of the discussions, and do not require client-side installation of proprietary software. The project SHOULD provide documentation in English and be able to accept bug reports and comments about code in English. The project MUST be maintained. The project MUST have a version-controlled source repository that is publicly readable and has a URL. The project’s source repository MUST track what changes were made, who made the changes, and when the changes were made. To enable collaborative review, the project’s source repository MUST include interim versions for review between releases; it MUST NOT include only final releases. It is SUGGESTED that common distributed version control software be used (e.g., git) for the project’s source repository. The project results MUST have a unique version identifier for each release intended to be used by users. It is SUGGESTED that the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) or Calendar Versioning (CalVer) version numbering format be used for releases. It is SUGGESTED that those who use CalVer include a micro level value. It is SUGGESTED that projects identify each release within their version control system. For example, it is SUGGESTED that those using git identify each release using git tags. The project MUST provide, in each release, release notes that are a human-readable summary of major changes in that release to help users determine if they should upgrade and what the upgrade impact will be. The release notes MUST NOT be the raw output of a version control log (e.g., the git log” command results are not release notes). Projects whose results are not intended for reuse in multiple locations (such as the software for a single website or service) AND employ continuous delivery MAY select “N/A”.” . The release notes MUST identify every publicly known run-time vulnerability fixed in this release that already had a CVE assignment or similar when the release was created. This criterion may be marked as not applicable (N/A) if users typically cannot practically update the software themselves (e.g., as is often true for kernel updates). This criterion applies only to the project results, not to its dependencies. If there are no release notes or there have been no publicly known vulnerabilities, choose N/A. The project MUST provide a process for users to submit bug reports (e.g., using an issue tracker or a mailing list). The project SHOULD use an issue tracker for tracking individual issues. The project MUST acknowledge a majority of bug reports submitted in the last 2-12 months (inclusive); the response need not include a fix. The project SHOULD respond to a majority (&gt;50%) of enhancement requests in the last 2-12 months (inclusive). The project MUST have a publicly available archive for reports and responses for later searching. The project MUST publish the process for reporting vulnerabilities on the project site. If private vulnerability reports are supported, the project MUST include how to send the information in a way that is kept private. The project’s initial response time for any vulnerability report received in the last 6 months MUST be less than or equal to 14 days. If the software produced by the project requires building for use, the project MUST provide a working build system that can automatically rebuild the software from source code. It is SUGGESTED that common tools be used for building the software. The project SHOULD be buildable using only FLOSS tools. The project MUST use at least one automated test suite that is publicly released as FLOSS (this test suite may be maintained as a separate FLOSS project). The project MUST clearly show or document how to run the test suite(s) (e.g., via a continuous integration (CI) script or via documentation in files such as BUILD.md, README.md, or CONTRIBUTING.md). A test suite SHOULD be invocable in a standard way for that language. It is SUGGESTED that the test suite cover most (or ideally all) the code branches, input fields, and functionality. It is SUGGESTED that the project implement continuous integration (where new or changed code is frequently integrated into a central code repository and automated tests are run on the result). The project MUST have a general policy (formal or not) that as major new functionality is added to the software produced by the project, tests of that functionality should be added to an automated test suite. The project MUST have evidence that the test_policy for adding tests has been adhered to in the most recent major changes to the software produced by the project.” . It is SUGGESTED that this policy on adding tests be documented in the instructions for change proposals.” . The project MUST enable one or more compiler warning flags, a safe language mode or use a separate “linter” tool to look for code quality errors or common simple mistakes if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can implement this criterion in the selected language. The project MUST address warnings. It is SUGGESTED that projects be maximally strict with warnings in the software produced by the project, where practical. The project MUST have at least one primary developer who knows how to design secure software. A great starting point for all projects is the Concise Guide for Developing More Secure Software maintained by OpenSSF. Past there, having a primary developer take the three courses outlined below ( all free to audit ) would be sufficient: . | Secure Software Development: Requirements, Design, and Reuse (LFD104x) - Linux Foundation - Training | Secure Software Development: Implementation (LFD105x) - Linux Foundation - Training | Secure Software Development: Verification and More Specialized Topics (LFD106x) - Linux Foundation - Training | . There are many additional resources maintained by OpenSSF that projects should reference as it pertains to language or domain-specific security topics. At least one of the project’s primary developers MUST know of common kinds of errors that lead to vulnerabilities in this kind of software, as well as at least one method to counter or mitigate each of them. Taking the classes in the previous item resolves this. The software produced by the project MUST use, by default, only cryptographic protocols and algorithms that are publicly published and reviewed by experts (if cryptographic protocols and algorithms are used). If the software produced by the project is an application or library, and its primary purpose is not to implement cryptography, then it SHOULD only call on software specifically designed to implement cryptographic functions; it SHOULD NOT re-implement its own. All functionality in the software produced by the project that depends on cryptography MUST be implementable using FLOSS. The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST use default keylengths that at least meet the NIST minimum requirements through the year 2030 (as stated in 2012). It MUST be possible to configure the software so that smaller keylengths are completely disabled. The default security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST NOT depend on broken cryptographic algorithms (e.g., MD4, MD5, single DES, RC4, Dual_EC_DRBG), or use cipher modes that are inappropriate to the context, unless they are necessary to implement an interoperable protocol (where the protocol implemented is the most recent version of that standard broadly supported by the network ecosystem, that ecosystem requires the use of such an algorithm or mode, and that ecosystem does not offer any more secure alternative). The documentation MUST describe any relevant security risks and any known mitigations if these broken algorithms or modes are necessary for an interoperable protocol. The default security mechanisms within the software produced by the project SHOULD NOT depend on cryptographic algorithms or modes with known serious weaknesses (e.g., the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm or the CBC mode in SSH). The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project SHOULD implement perfect forward secrecy for key agreement protocols so a session key derived from a set of long-term keys cannot be compromised if one of the long-term keys is compromised in the future. If the software produced by the project causes the storing of passwords for authentication of external users, the passwords MUST be stored as iterated hashes with a per-user salt by using a key stretching (iterated) algorithm (e.g., Argon2id, Bcrypt, Scrypt, or PBKDF2). See also OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet. The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST generate all cryptographic keys and nonces using a cryptographically secure random number generator, and MUST NOT do so using generators that are cryptographically insecure. The project MUST use a delivery mechanism that counters MITM attacks. Using https or ssh+scp is acceptable. Making project releases available via GitHub using the Releases mechanism satisfies this requirement. A cryptographic hash (e.g., a sha1sum) MUST NOT be retrieved over http and used without checking for a cryptographic signature. There MUST be no unpatched vulnerabilities of medium or higher severity that have been publicly known for more than 60 days. Projects SHOULD fix all critical vulnerabilities rapidly after they are reported. The public repositories MUST NOT leak a valid private credential (e.g., a working password or private key) that is intended to limit public access. At least one static code analysis tool (beyond compiler warnings and safe language modes) MUST be applied to any proposed major production release of the software before its release if there is at least one FLOSS tool that implements this criterion in the selected language. SonarCloud is the tool that multiple projects have implemented, and there is already an organization-level access token that projects can use with it. You can see a specific example in the OpenEXR analysis_workflow.yml, which shows how to build, run the test suite, post-process, and upload to SonarCloud using the SONAR_TOKEN from the organization level. You can see the results for the various ASWF projects with SonarCloud here: . https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/academysoftwarefoundation/projects . There also is some work towards using clang-tidy in Imath: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/blob/main/config/ImathSetup.cmake . and in OSL: . https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenShadingLanguage/blob/3bd377861087f99c6c69d73a95176d88072ff5da/src/cmake/compiler.cmake#L406 . It is SUGGESTED that at least one of the static analysis tools used for the static_analysis criterion include rules or approaches to look for common vulnerabilities in the analyzed language or environment. All medium and higher severity exploitable vulnerabilities discovered with static code analysis MUST be fixed in a timely way after they are confirmed. It is SUGGESTED that static source code analysis occur on every commit or at least daily. It is SUGGESTED that at least one dynamic analysis tool be applied to any proposed major production release of the software before its release. It is SUGGESTED that if the software produced by the project includes software written using a memory-unsafe language (e.g., C or C++), then at least one dynamic tool (e.g., a fuzzer or web application scanner) be routinely used in combination with a mechanism to detect memory safety problems such as buffer overwrites. If the project does not produce software written in a memory-unsafe language, choose not applicable (N/A). It is SUGGESTED that the project use a configuration for at least some dynamic analysis (such as testing or fuzzing) which enables many assertions. In many cases these assertions should not be enabled in production builds. All medium and higher severity exploitable vulnerabilities discovered with dynamic code analysis MUST be fixed in a timely way after they are confirmed. ",

    "content": "The project MUST achieve a passing level badge. The information on how to contribute MUST include the requirements for acceptable contributions (e.g., a reference to any required coding standard). The recommendation is to have this specifically outlined in the README.md or in a separate CONTRIBUTING.md file. OpenEXR’s CONTRIBUTING.md is a great example to follow. The project SHOULD have a legal mechanism where all developers of non-trivial amounts of project software assert that they are legally authorized to make these contributions. The most common and easily-implemented approach for doing this is by using a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) where users add “signed-off-by” in their commits and the project links to the DCO website. However this MAY be implemented as a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) or other legal mechanism. All projects hosted have this requirement in their IP policies already and it is setup to be managed for each project by default, so this requirement is fulfilled. The project MUST clearly define and document its project governance model (the way it makes decisions, including key roles). Having this in a GOVERNANCE.md would suffice; there is an example one defined in the test project. The project MUST adopt a code of conduct and post it in a standard location. All ASWF project by default adopt the LF Projects LLC CoC, so this requirement is fulfilled. The project MUST clearly define and publicly document the key roles in the project and their responsibilities, including any tasks those roles must perform. It MUST be clear who has which role(s), though this might not be documented in the same way. Having this in a GOVERNANCE.md would suffice; there is an example one defined in the test project. The project MUST be able to continue with minimal interruption if any one person dies, is incapacitated, or is otherwise unable or unwilling to continue support of the project. In particular, the project MUST be able to create and close issues, accept proposed changes, and release versions of software, within a week of confirmation of the loss of support from any one individual. This MAY be done by ensuring someone else has any necessary keys, passwords, and legal rights to continue the project. Individuals who run a FLOSS project MAY do this by providing keys in a lockbox and a will providing any needed legal rights (e.g., for DNS names). Each repo has thelinuxfoundation as a user on their repo, so this requirement is fulfilled. The project SHOULD have a bus factor of 2 or more. You need to have more than one maintainer; ASWF doesn’t accept any projects with only one maintainer, so this requirement is fulfilled. The project MUST have a documented roadmap that describes what the project intends to do and not do for at least the next year. This could be a GitHub project board for the project that outlines the planned issues, or a document in the repo or somewhere else that lists the planned work. This list can change over time, but having something gives confidence to downstream users. The project MUST include documentation of the architecture (aka high-level design) of the software produced by the project. If the project does not produce software, select not applicable (N/A). This can be as simple or complex as it makes sense. At a minimum, having something that describes how the code is organized is sufficient. This is a great tool to have available for getting new contributors onboarded. The project MUST document what the user can and cannot expect in terms of security from the software produced by the project (its security requirements). This likely will align with the security assurance case, but the doc should cover what the project does for security ( for example, input sanitization ) and areas that the project doesn’t directly address but the user should ( for example, don’t run as root ). The project MUST provide a quick start guide for new users to help them quickly do something with the software. This is a cornerstone of good documentation. Part of this is the installation instructions, but having an example to show how the project works or something the user could do to understand how it works is of huge value to prospective users. OpenEXR has a great example. The project MUST make an effort to keep the documentation consistent with the current version of the project results (including software produced by the project). Any known documentation defects making it inconsistent MUST be fixed. If the documentation is generally current, but erroneously includes some older information that is no longer true, just treat that as a defect, then track and fix as usual. Good practice for any project. Many projects keep the documentation alongside the code so when changes are made it’s reflected in the same branch. Just The Docs has support for multiple versions of documentation. The project repository front page and/or website MUST identify and hyperlink to any achievements, including this best practices badge, within 48 hours of public recognition that the achievement has been attained. Put it in the README.md, either as a badge or textual notice. The project (both project sites and project results) SHOULD follow accessibility best practices so that persons with disabilities can still participate in the project and use the project results where it is reasonable to do so. If a project is just working out of GitHub/Read The Docs/Confluence and not building a formal website, then this requirement is fulfilled. If you have a separate website, it’s a good idea to review and assess. The software produced by the project SHOULD be internationalized to enable easy localization for the target audience’s culture, region, or language. If internationalization (i18n) does not apply (e.g., the software doesn’t generate text intended for end-users and doesn’t sort human-readable text), select not applicable (N/A). Note you don’t need multiple languages supported, just the mechanism such that you could ( i.e., split text strings out to a separate document ). If the project sites (website, repository, and download URLs) store passwords for authentication of external users, the passwords MUST be stored as iterated hashes with a per-user salt by using a key stretching (iterated) algorithm (e.g., Argon2id, Bcrypt, Scrypt, or PBKDF2). If the project sites do not store passwords for this purpose, select not applicable (N/A). Note that these sites already meet this criterion: GitHub, GitLab, ReadTheDocs, and any tools integrated with Linux Foundation (LF) IDs. If you are using just these tools then this requirement is fulfilled. The project MUST maintain the most often used older versions of the product or provide an upgrade path to newer versions. If the upgrade path is difficult, the project MUST document how to perform the upgrade (e.g., the interfaces that have changed and detailed suggested steps to help upgrade). Good practice overall. You don’t need a migration script, just instructions. The project MUST use an issue tracker for tracking individual issues. All ASWF projects do this, so this requirement is fulfilled. The project MUST give credit to the reporter(s) of all reports resolved in the last 12 months, except for the reporter(s) who request anonymity. If there have been no vulnerabilities resolved in the last 12 months, select not applicable (N/A). A good practice is to put this in the SECURITY.md. The project MUST have a documented process for responding to vulnerability reports. GitHub does have features for security vulnerability management, which as a best practice should be used, but in addition, a project should have SECURITY file in the primary code repository to outline this process ( OpenEXR is a great example of this ). The project MUST identify the specific coding style guides for the primary languages it uses, and require that contributions generally comply with it. Good example from OpenEXR. You can adopt an existing coding style to make this easier. The project MUST automatically enforce its selected coding style(s) if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can do so in the selected language(s). If you are using a standard coding style, there are numerous tools to validate that will integrate into GitHub actions. Build systems for native binaries MUST honor the relevant compiler and linker (environment) variables passed in to them (e.g., CC, CFLAGS, CXX, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS) and pass them to compiler and linker invocations. A build system MAY extend them with additional flags; it MUST NOT simply replace provided values with its own. If no native binaries are being generated, select not applicable (N/A). Generally, ASWF projects don’t produce binaries for users, so this would be ‘N/A’. The build and installation system SHOULD preserve debugging information if they are requested in the relevant flags (e.g., install -s is not used). If there is no build or installation system (e.g. typical JavaScript libraries) select not applicable (N/A). The build system for the software produced by the project MUST NOT recursively build subdirectories if there are cross-dependencies in the subdirectories. If there is no build or installation system (e.g., typical JavaScript libraries), select not applicable” (N/A). The project MUST be able to repeat the process of generating information from source files and get exactly the same bit-for-bit result. If no building occurs (e.g., scripting languages where the source code is used directly instead of being compiled), select not applicable (N/A). The easiest solution is not to provide a binary build of the project, which is generally recommended. There is ongoing work within the CI Working Group on how GitHub Actions or another tool could help satisfy this requirement. The project MUST provide a way to easily install and uninstall the software produced by the project using a commonly-used convention. The installation system for end-users MUST honor standard conventions for selecting the location where built artifacts are written to at installation time. For example, if it installs files on a POSIX system it MUST honor the DESTDIR environment variable. If there is no installation system or no standard convention, select not applicable” (N/A).” . The project MUST provide a way for potential developers to quickly install all the project results and support environment necessary to make changes, including the tests and test environment. This MUST be performed with a commonly-used convention. The project MUST list external dependencies in a computer-processable way. LFX Security automatically will pull the list of dependencies for a project, provided they use the standard mechanisms leveraged by Snyk. Note there is still outstanding work to be done for C/C++ projects to be supported. Projects MUST monitor or periodically check their external dependencies (including convenience copies) to detect known vulnerabilities, and fix exploitable vulnerabilities or verify them as unexploitable. Same as above. The project SHOULD avoid using deprecated or obsolete functions and APIs where FLOSS alternatives are available in the set of technology it uses (its technology stack) and to a supermajority of the users the project supports (so that users have ready access to the alternative). Good practice. An automated test suite MUST be applied on each check-in to a shared repository for at least one branch. This test suite MUST produce a report on test success or failure. This can be easily integrated into the PR actions; good practice for ensuring contributions don’t break existing functionality. The project MUST add regression tests to an automated test suite for at least 50% of the bugs fixed within the last six months. See below for how to address . The project MUST have FLOSS automated test suite(s) that provide at least 80% statement coverage if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can measure this criterion in the selected language. A few considerations for projects in completing this requirement: . | If testing a code path requires specialized hardware not available to the project, then the project should deduct that code from the total amount of code to measure this requirement. | Similarly, a project likely will not be able to test integrations with third-party commercial products. In some cases, a project may be able to create mocks that simulate the third-party application’s integration points, but in cases where that is not possible, the project should deduct that code from the total amount of code to measure this requirement. | Sometimes, build/compile options change the test coverage between runs. For these cases, the project should measure based on the coverage across all runs. For example | . Run 1: Covers code branches A, B, and C Run 2: Covers code branches A, C, and D . In this case, the project can indicate test coverage for code branches A, B, C, and D, even though not all code branches as covered in a single run. The project MUST have a formal written policy that as major new functionality is added, tests for the new functionality MUST be added to an automated test suite. Can be a simple statement - example OpenEXR . The project MUST include, in its documented instructions for change proposals, the policy that tests are to be added for major new functionality. Can be a simple statement - example OpenEXR . Projects MUST be maximally strict with warnings in the software produced by the project, where practical. “The project MUST implement secure design principles (from know_secure_design) where applicable. If the project is not producing software select “not applicable” (N/A). The default security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST NOT depend on cryptographic algorithms or modes with known serious weaknesses (e.g., the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm or the CBC mode in SSH). The project SHOULD support multiple cryptographic algorithms, so users can quickly switch if one is broken. Common symmetric key algorithms include AES, Twofish, and Serpent. Common cryptographic hash algorithm alternatives include SHA-2 (including SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 AND SHA-512) and SHA-3. The project MUST support storing authentication credentials (such as passwords and dynamic tokens) and private cryptographic keys in files that are separate from other information (such as configuration files, databases, and logs), and permit users to update and replace them without code recompilation. If the project never processes authentication credentials and private cryptographic keys, select not applicable” (N/A). The software produced by the project SHOULD support secure protocols for all of its network communications, such as SSHv2 or later, TLS1.2 or later (HTTPS), IPsec, SFTP, and SNMPv3. Insecure protocols such as FTP, HTTP, telnet, SSLv3 or earlier, and SSHv1 SHOULD be disabled by default, and only enabled if the user specifically configures it. If the software produced by the project does not support network communications, select not applicable” (N/A). The software produced by the project SHOULD, if it supports or uses TLS, support at least TLS version 1.2. Note that the predecessor of TLS was called SSL.

The software produced by the project MUST, if it supports TLS, perform certificate verification before sending HTTP headers with private information (such as secure cookies). If the software does not use TLS, select not applicable” (N/A). The project MUST cryptographically sign releases of the project results intended for widespread use, and there MUST be a documented process explaining to users how they can obtain the public signing keys and verify the signature(s). The private key for these signature(s) MUST NOT be on site(s) used to directly distribute the software to the public. If releases are not intended for widespread use, select not applicable” (N/A). It is SUGGESTED that in the version control system, each important version tag (a tag that is part of a major release, minor release, or fixes publicly noted vulnerabilities) be cryptographically signed and verifiable as described in signed_releases. The project results MUST check all inputs from potentially untrusted sources to ensure they are valid (an allowlist), and reject invalid inputs, if there are any restrictions on the data at all. Hardening mechanisms SHOULD be used in the software produced by the project so that software defects are less likely to result in security vulnerabilities. The project MUST provide an assurance case that justifies why its security requirements are met. The assurance case MUST include: a description of the threat model, clear identification of trust boundaries, an argument that secure design principles have been applied, and an argument that common implementation security weaknesses have been countered. The goal here is for the project to define its security process and scope for the project. A good example of such a document is from curl. The project MUST use at least one static analysis tool with rules or approaches to look for common vulnerabilities in the analyzed language or environment, if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can implement this criterion in the selected language. If the software produced by the project includes software written using a memory-unsafe language (e.g., C or C++), then at least one dynamic tool (e.g., a fuzzer or web application scanner) MUST be routinely used in combination with a mechanism to detect memory safety problems such as buffer overwrites.

    "doc": "Code Review Best Practices",
    "title": "Code Review Best Practices",
    "content": "Why do we code review? . Code review is a process where someone other than the author of a patch examines the proposed changes and approves or critiques them. The main benefits are to: . | Encourage submitters to ensure that their changes are well thought out, tested, and documented so that their intent and wisdom will be clear to others. | Directly find shortcomings in or suggest improvements to the proposed changes, and ensure that the changes are consistent with the project’s best practices. | Minimize the amount of the code base that has only been seen or is only understood by one person. | Improve security and robustness of the code base by assuring that at least two people (submitter and reviewer) agree that every patch is reasonable and safe. | . Reviewer guidelines – what you should be looking for . Code review is not difficult, and it doesn’t require you to be a senior developer or a domain expert. Even if you don’t particularly understand that region of the code and are not a domain expert in the feature being changed, you can still provide a helpful second pair of eyes to look for obvious red flags and give an adequate review: . | This may seem too obvious to say explicitly, but a big part of review is just looking at the PR and seeing that it doesn’t appear to deface, purposely/obviously break, or introduce malware into the project. | Does the explanation of the PR make logical sense and appear to match (as near as you can tell) the changes in the code? Does it seem sensible, even if you don’t understand all the details? | Does the PR pass all of our existing CI tests? (If it does, at least we are reasonably sure it doesn’t break commonly used features.) | Is there any evidence that the changes have been tested? Ideally, something already in, or added to the testsuite by this PR, exercises the new or altered code. (Though sometimes a patch addresses an edge case that’s very hard to reproduce in the testsuite, and you have to rely on the submitter’s word and the sensibility of their explanation.) | Not required, but nice if we can get it: You’re an expert in the part of the code being changed, and you agree that this is the best way to achieve an improvement. | Any objections should be explained in detail and invite counter-arguments from the author or other onlookers. A reviewer should never close a PR unless it fails to conform to even the basic requirements of any submitted PR, or if enough time has passed that it’s clear that the PR has been abandoned by its author. It’s ok to ultimately say “no” to a PR that can’t be salvaged, but that should be the result of a dialogue. | . Obviously, you also want any review comments you give to be constructive and helpful. If you don’t understand something, ask for clarification. If you think something is wrong, suggest a fix if you know how to fix it. If you think something is missing, suggest what you think should be added. Follow the expected kind and constructive tone of the project’s community. Submitter guidelines – how to encourage good reviews and timely merges . A few tips for submitters to help ensure that your PRs get reviewed and merged in a timely manner and are respectful of the reviewers’ time and effort: . | Aim for small PRs that do a specific thing in a clear way. It is better to implement a large change with a series of PRs that each take a small, obvious step forward, than to have one huge PR that makes changes so extensive that nobody quite knows how to evaluate it. | Make sure your PR commit summary message clearly explains the why and how of your changes. You want someone to read that and judge whether it’s a sensible approach, know what to look for in the code, and have their examination of the code make them say “yes, I see, of course, great, just as I expected!” | If you have extensive formatting changes or are moving existing code around, it is strongly suggested that those changes be submitted as a separate PR from anything that changes code logic. It is very hard to review code changes when code movement or reformatting obscure exactly what has changed and what has not. | Make sure your PR includes a test of the new or changed functionality (if not covered by existing tests). | Make sure your PR fully passes the project’s CI tests. Be kind to reviewers’ inboxes and attention by first pushing to your own fork and making all the fixups needed to pass CI before submitting the PR that will fail CI and leave reviewers unsure when it’s complete enough to review. (You will need to ensure that your own fork has CI enabled.) | Make sure your PR modifies the documentation as necessary if it adds new features, changes any public APIs, or alters behavior of existing features. | If the project has multiple language bindings (e.g., a C++ library with a Python binding as well), make sure that any API functionality you have added is present (and tested) for all the language bindings so they don’t get out of sync. | . Code review procedures – in the ideal case . In the best of circumstances, the code review process should be as follows for EVERY pull request: . [!NOTE] The following advice is generic, and we expect some projects to have different specific requirements for the number and identity of reviewers, how long a PR must be open to review, etc. | At least one reviewer critiques and eventually (possibly after changes are made) approves the pull request. Reviewers, by definition, are not the same person as the author. | Reviewers should indicate their approval by clicking the “Approve” button in GitHub, or by adding a comment that says “LGTM” (looks good to me). | If possible, reviewers should have some familiarity with the code being changed (though for a large code base, this is not always possible). | At least a few work days should elapse between posting the PR and merging it, even if an approving review is received immediately. This is to allow additional reviewers or dissenting voices to get a chance to weigh in. | If the reviewer has suggestions for improvement, it’s the original author who should make the changes and push them to the PR, or at the very least, the author should okay any changes made by the reviewer before a merge occurs (if at all practical). | It is permissible to request the “Copilot Review” from GitHub, but keep in mind that (a) it should augment, and not be treated as being a substitute for human developer reviews; (b) if any of its suggestions are incorporated into the PR, the human PR author takes full responsibility for its correctness and provenance, just as if they had written that code from scratch themselves. | . Not all patches need the highest level of scrutiny. At the discretion of the project leader, reviews can be cursory and quick, and merges performed without additional delay, in some common low-risk circumstances: . | The patch fixes broken CI, taking the project from a verifiably broken state to passing all of the CI builds and tests. | The changes are only to documentation, comments, or other non-code files, and so cannot break the build or introduce new bugs. | The code changes are trivial and are obviously correct. (This is a judgment call, but if the author or reviewer or both are among the project’s senior developers, they don’t need to performatively pretend that they aren’t sure it’s a good patch.) | The changes are to sufficiently localized and low risk code, that even if wrong, would only have the potential to break individual non-critical features or rarely-used code paths. (Remember, this still assumes that CI fully passes and test coverage includes the feature being altered by the PR.) | . Conversely, some patches are so important or risky that if possible, they should be reviewed by multiple people, preferably from different stakeholder institutions than the author, and ensure that the approval is made with a detailed understanding of the issues. In these cases, it may also be worth bringing up the issue up at a TSC meeting to ensure the attention of many stakeholders. These include: . | New directions: Addition of major new features, new strategic initiatives, or changes to APIs that introduce new idioms or usage patterns should give ample time for all stakeholders to provide feedback. In such cases, it may be worth having the PR open for comments for weeks, not just days. | Risky changes: Changes to core classes or code that could subtly break many things if not done right, or introduce performance regressions to critical cases. | Compatibility breaks: changes that propose to break backward API compatibility with existing code or data files, or that change the required toolchain or dependencies needed to build the project. | Security: Changes that could introduce security vulnerabilities, or that fix tricky security issues where the best fix is not obvious. | . Code review compromises – because things are rarely ideal . We would love to have many senior reviewers constantly watching for PRs, doing thorough reviews immediately, and following the above guidelines without exception. Wouldn’t that be great! But in reality, we have to compromise, hurry, or cut corners, or nothing would ever get done. Some of these compromises are understandable and acceptable if they aren’t happening too often. | Lack of reviews: If no reviews are forthcoming after a few days, a “are there any objections?” comment may be added to the PR, and if no objections are raised within another few days, the PR may be merged by the author if they are a senior developer on the project. This is a fact of life, but should be minimized (with a rigor proportional to where the patch falls on the “low risk / high risk” scale described above). If this is done, you should leave an additional comment explaining why it was merged without review and inviting people to submit post-merge comments if they subsequently spot something that can be improved. | Time-critical patches: urgent security fixes, broken CI or builds, critical bugs affecting major stakeholders who are waiting for a repaired release, fixes that are blocking other work or preventing other PRs from advancing. In such cases, it is understandable for senior developers to try to speed up the process of getting the changes integrated (though the very nature of their criticality also indicates that it’s worth getting a thorough review if at all possible). | Failing tests: Sometimes a PR must be merged despite failing CI tests. Usually this is for one of two reasons: (1) spurious CI failures are known to be occurring at that time and are unrelated to the PR; (2) the PR is part of a series of patches that are only expected to fully pass CI when the last piece is completed. | . These changes are understandable, but we still are striving to reduce their frequency. It is the responsibility of the senior developers, TSC members, and major stakeholders to be monitoring the incoming PRs and helping with reviews as much as possible, to ensure that review exceptions are rare. Code review pathologies – things to avoid . These are anti-patterns that generally are indications of an unhealthy open source project: . | An author merging their own PR without any review comments that indicate meaningful scrutiny or approval from another party, and without giving adequate warning that a merge will occur if no reviews are received. | PRs languishing for weeks or months without any review or merge. | PRs that don’t adequately test their changes (basically crossing your fingers and hoping it works). | PRs that are merged despite failing CI that might be related or, if unrelated, that might be masking problems with the PR being evaluated. | . Again, sometimes these things happen out of necessity to keep the project moving forward under constrained development resources. But we strive as much as possible to ensure that they are rare exceptions. ",

    "content": "Generally open source projects at The Linux Foundation that have not previously selected a license leverage the Apache License, Version 2.0 for their codebase, a Community Data License Agreement (CDLA) license for any data sets, and the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License for all documentation and non-code assets. These licenses are widely used and understood by developers and organizations alike, providing flexibility for downstream usage and patent protection for those contributing code. Each hosted project maintains their own Intellectual Property policy as part of thier Technical Charter which outlines the specific guidelines. Code License Identification . Each repository must contain a license file. Include the plain-text version of the license as a LICENSE file in the top-level directory of the repository. All source files need to include a header to clearly show the license. Academy Software Foundation recommends using SPDX short-form license identifiers in source code files, which vastly reduces errors in copy and pasting license text and enables the headers to be machine-readable. An example of the use of SPDX short-form license identifiers can be found here. Copyright Notice Format . We have recommended that contributors to a new project establish a common format for copyright notices in their own code. This can help minimize compliance burdens that might otherwise require downstream distributors to reproduce many variations in years, entity names, and formats for notices. We recommend a common copyright notice in a form similar to the following, which does not refer to years or specific contributing entities: . Copyright Contributors to the __________ Project. For clarity, we would not recommend removing a third party’s license or copyright notice in any circumstance. If a third-party dependency is added to a repository, its license and copyright notices should be preserved and should not be modified or removed. Example of the SPDX short-form license identifiers and copyright notice in a source file .

    "title": "Contribution sign off",
    "content": "Ensuring a clean code pedigree and lineage is critical to the industry’s downstream adoption of open-source code. Academy Software Foundation requires the use of the Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO), which is the same mechanism that the Linux® Kernel and many other communities use to manage code contributions. The DCO is considered one of the simplest tools for sign-offs from contributors as the representations are meant to be easy to read and indicate signoff is done as a part of the commit message. The DCO is a representation by someone stating they have the right to contribute the code they have proposed for acceptance into a project. That representation is important for legal purposes and was the community-developed outcome after a $1 billion lawsuit by SCO against IBM. The representation is designed to prevent issues but also keep the burden on contributors low. It has proven very adaptable to other projects, is built into git itself (and now also GitHub), and is in use by thousands of projects to avoid more burdensome requirements to contribute (such as a CLA). Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO: . Signed-off-by: John Doe &lt;john.doe@example.com&gt; . You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using git commit -s. DCO and Real Names . The DCO requires the use of a real name that can be used to identify someone in case there is an issue about a contribution they made. A real name does not require a legal name, nor a birth name, nor any name that appears on an official ID (e.g. a passport). Your real name is the name you convey to people in the community for them to use to identify you as you. The key concern is that your identification is sufficient enough to contact you if an issue were to arise in the future about your contribution. Your real name should not be an anonymous id or false name that misrepresents who you are. Additional context can be found here. Make doing DCO signoffs easier . By default, all GitHub repositories have both the GitHub DCO App installed and commit signoffs enabled. This ensures anyone contributing via the GitHub web interface will automatically signoff commits. For developers working from thier local machines, there are a few options available to automatically signoff commits. | DCO command line tool, which lets you do a single signoff for an entire repo. | Shell scripting to automatically apply signing. Here is an example for bash, to be put into a .bashrc file: | . git() { if [[ $1 == \"commit\" ]]; then shift echo \"Executing git commit -s $@\" command git commit -s \"$@\" else command git \"$@\" fi } . Signoff for commits where the DCO signoff was missed . When bringing in a code repository for the first time or commits done before the DCO checks are enabled, there would be a series of commits that don’t include the sign-off statement. You can retroactively signoff commits you’ve made by making a commit with your DCO signoff that contains a new text file (the suggested name is past_commits.txt ) with the following contents: . The following commits were made pursuant to the Developer Certificate of Origin, even though a Signed-off-by: was not included in the commit message. &lt;COMMIT HASH&gt; &lt;COMMIT MSG&gt; ... Each user who has made the past commits should have their own Signed-off-by: line in the commit message. This process can be automated using the DCO Org Check script. Handling DCO errors using GitHub website commits. The Probot: DCO app requires that the email address and name specified in the DCO Signoff match that of the current information from the user making the commit. Generally, this is handled automatically when using a local git client, but when making contributions from the GitHub website directly, this needs to be aligned manually. Contributor License Agreement (CLA) . Some projects might either have used a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) in the past (either in the form of a Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) or an Individual Contributior License Agreement (ICLA)) or have considered using it. The use of a CLA is not required for open-source projects, and many of the use cases for CLAs are handled through the lighter-weight DCO or by having an independent entity in a place like the Academy Software Foundation makes available. If your project does have this requirement, Academy Software Foundation recommends reaching out to The Linux Foundation in advance to discuss before proposing your project to the community. The CLA templates recommended by the Academy Software Foundation’s Legal Committee presently are the Academy Software Foundation 2020 CCLA template and Academy Software Foundation 2020 ICLA template. These are derived from the Apache Software Foundation’s CCLA and ICLA templates, and contain substantively the same scope of license grants and requirements. The changes are intended to reflect Academy Software Foundation entities rather than Apache Software Foundation as the project host and to include administrative changes for Academy Software Foundation’s use of the EasyCLA tool to manage authorized contributors under signed CLAs.

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "content": "Q: What if the project I want to propose is not under an Apache License, Version 2.0, Community Data License Agreement (CDLA) license, or Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License? . A: Some projects may be able to relicense to the Apache License, Version 2.0 for their codebase, a Community Data License Agreement (CDLA) license for any data sets, and the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License for all documentation and non-code assets. If this can be easily done by one entity with the appropriate rights, this is our preferred approach. Projects with a history of contributions from multiple parties may not be able to relicense easily. Where another OSI-approved license is in place, the project may be proposed under its existing license and accepted without license change. Use of a license not approved by the Academy Software Foundation does not preclude you from making a proposal but be sure in your project proposal to address the anticipated challenges of relicensing the project. Q: Does the use of a particular open-source license require the use of a CLA? . A: No common open-source license requires the use of a CLA. Most open-source projects do not use a CLA. Some critical projects use CLAs, often to ensure contributions and grants made under the license are backed by the company employing developers. Q: If a project already uses a particular CLA, can the CLA be changed or deprecated? . A: Yes. Q: Can umbrella CLAs be established where contributors and their organizations grant rights to all Academy Software Foundation projects? . A: The Academy Software Foundation TAC sees value in lowering the friction to contribution and is investigating this as an option as the number of hosted projects grows. In the meantime, projects aligning around the Academy Software Foundation 2020 CCLA template and Academy Software Foundation 2020 ICLA template will ensure minimal legal review for signing a CCLA and/or ICLA. Q: When a project uses a CLA with the Apache License, Version 2.0, is it common for ASF Contributor Agreements to be employed? Should Academy Software Foundation projects that require a CLA and use the Apache License, Version 2.0 employ the Apache CLA or the LF minimal CLA? . A: There is no requirement for a project to adopt ASF Contributor Agreements with code licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. Many open source projects leverage the Apache License, Version 2.0 without using ASF Contributor Agreements or sometimes without a CLA in general (in many cases use of the DCO alone is sufficent for project communities). The Academy Software Foundation community is aiming to align around the Academy Software Foundation 2020 CCLA template and Academy Software Foundation 2020 ICLA template in cases where use of a CLA is required. Projects may also use the Linux Foundation minimal CCLA template and Linux Foundation minimal ICLA template. Q: Why does the project require me to sign a CLA? . A: It depends from project to project. Typically, projects that use CLAs do so because the project community wants to ensure that there is a signed agreement explicitly stating the legal terms governing the contribution to the project. CLAs can also be used by organizations in connection with specifying which of their employees are permitted to contribute code on their behalf, under that CLA. Q: What is the difference between a Corporate and Individual CLA? . A: The Corporate CLA is designed for an organization to authorize contributors that have permission to contribute on behalf of the organization. The Individual CLA is specific for an individual contributor, including those not affliated with an organization. Q: Who needs to sign the Corporate CLA? . A: The Corporate CLA should be signed by someone in your organization who has sufficient authority to execute the CLA on its behalf. Each company or other organization has its own internal controls to determine who has this authority, so the project can’t determine this for you; for example, it might be an executive or other member of your leadership, but you should always consult your organization’s leadership to confirm. Q: What is a CLA Manager? . A: A CLA Manager is the person or are the persons in your organization that are authorized by the signatory of the Corporate CLA to authorize contributors from your organization. This often is a development manager or team lead who is overseeing the contributions being made to a given project. Q: Do I need to have my employer sign the CCLA if I am making contributions on my own time and using my own equipment? . A: This varies depending on where you live and work, and your employer’s policies and agreements. If you have any questions then you should discuss with your manager and/or your employer’s legal team before contributing. Q: I submitted a PR before I signed the CLA, so the PR is now marked with the red EasyCLA “NOT COVERED” error. What do I do to get the error to go away? . A: Refer to the EasyCLA documentation on making your first contribution to a EasyCLA managed repository, but generally it should go away on its own after a few minutes. If you still have issues, please file a support request. Q: Myself or my company has a CLA for another Academy Software Foundation project, doesn’t that cover this project, too? . A: Each Academy Software Foundation project leverages a seperate CLA for contributions to their project. You can follow the guide to automatically notify your organization’s CLA manager for the given project and authorize you under their Corporate CLA. Q: My Corporate CLA manager says I should be on the approved list, but my PR is still blocked. What gives? . A: Confirm that you are selecting the proper company name as there may be multiple corporate entities registered. If you still have issues, please file a support request. ",

    "content": "When a new project or repository is to be added, please submit a request to facilitate the process. Code license scan . If adding the new project or repository will include a significant contribution, requesting a code license scan is highly recommended before bringing the code in. This scan will look for and will provide recommendations (or, in some cases, required prior remediation) for: . | The presence of third-party licenses (OSI-approved or otherwise) that might be considered incompatible with the project’s license | Presence of headers with the project’s designated license(s) and preferred copyright notices in project files (refer to the License Specification in the Contribution Guidelines for more information) | Any other best practices guidance | . Typically code license scans are a quick turnaround, but that might take longer for more significant code bases. Repository setup . Generally, most projects utilize the existing Academy Software Foundation GitHub organization, especially if they intend to have a single repository. This practice enables the easiest discoverability of the project. If a project anticipates having multiple repositories, the Academy Software Foundation staff can provision a GitHub organization specific to that project. The same policies apply to the administration and access control with either option. Code migration . There are two strategies for migrating the code to a hosted project repository. | The best practice is for the Academy Software Foundation staff to provision a new repository, where the new code can be contributed to as a pull request. | If preserving the commit history is important, the repository can be transferred using the GitHub transfer repository process. If doing this, before the transfer, you must add a commit to the repositories providing a DCO signoff for all previous commits. The easiest way is to check in a file called past-dco-signoff.txt with the contents below… | .

Projects should define a COMMITTERS.* file for indicating committers that can merge in code to a repository. The list of committers is generally approved by the TSC or the committers, aligning with the requirements described in the project’s governance. Permissions are managed using GitHub teams, where the TSC or committers will have a team, and that team will be given ‘maintain’ permission on the repositories. The best process for adding a new committer is to have that committer issue a pull request to add their name to the COMMITTERS.* file, where the required number of TSC members or committers can +1 the request, and the TSC chairperson can merge in it and can add the individual to the team. Adding read-only members to an organization . By default, hosted project GitHub organizations and repositories have enabled the invite-contributors GitHub app installed, which will automatically send an invite to anyone with a successful merged pull request to join the organization as a member.

Note that WhiteSource has recently been incorporated into the license scanning workflow, so some of this functionality will be subject to continued development of the scanning workflow automation. Notes . | The Linux Foundation is not able to provide legal advice to project community members.

However, questions about e.g. whether a license is legally okay to use must be directed to the contributor’s own legal counsel and/or a project’s Legal Committee. | The support program utilizes various automated tools supplemented by manual reviews. However, like any other scanning tool or process, the LF cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the license scanning results, and does not guarantee that all possible license issues in a scanned codebase will be identified. | . Dependencies on other LF and project teams . | Will periodically need assistance from project manager or similar project staff support, to coordinate on preferred methods for communications with appropriate project community members. | May periodically need LF IT assistance for configuring certain types of scans, for those that are dependent of CI/CD processes that are managed by LF IT (none presently anticipated for current projects / scan types) . | .

Requirements . To be accepted at the Sandbox stage, a project must: . | Have completed and approved the Technical Charter and agree to transfer any relevant trademarks to The Linux Foundation or its affiliate, LF Projects, LLC, and to assist in filing for any relevant unregistered ones. | Have had a successful license scan with any critical issues remedied. | Submit a completed Project Contribution Proposal Template to the TAC. | Provide such additional information as the TAC may reasonably request. | Present the project’s proposal to the TAC.

Benefits . The Sandbox Stage benefits are outlined below. | Neutral hosting of the project’s community and key assets (e.g., trademark, domain, etc.). | Access to the Academy Software Foundation collaboration infrastructure ( including GitHub, JIRA, Confluence, mailing lists, and Slack ). | A sponsor from the TAC will assist the project in reaching the Incubation Stage and facilitate collaboration with other project communities. | The right to refer to the project as a Sandbox Project of the Academy Software Foundation and the opportunity to participate in events and other collaborative activities sponsored by the Academy Software Foundation. | Subject to applicable trademark usage guidelines to display the Academy Software Foundation’s logo on the project’s code repository. | .

Expectations . The TAC may request Sandbox Stage projects to provide updates outlining its progress on completing the requirements for the Incubation Stage before the Annual Review. If a project fails to provide these reports after a TAC request, the TAC may vote to remove the project from the Sandbox stage. Projects in the Sandbox Stage are expected to move or have made demonstrable progress on moving to the Incubation Stage within one year. Sandbox Projects may propose to be reviewed to move to the Incubation Stage during its regularly scheduled Annual Review; projects can also request to hold their annual review early if they have completed the requirements before its scheduled Annual Review. At the project’s Annual Review, the TAC will vote to either: . | Move the project to the Incubation Stage if it meets the requirements for that stage. | Renew the project at the Sandbox Stage if it feels it will move to the Incubation Stage by the next Annual Review. | Move the project to the Archived Stage.

Graduated stage projects are eligible to receive the following benefits: . | Be considered as one of the “TAC Projects” under the Academy Software Foundation Charter and may receive additional resources or support as determined by the Governing Board. | Have a voting representative on the TAC. | Right to refer to the project as an officially Graduated project of the Academy Software Foundation and receive the highest priority for participating in events and other collaborative activities sponsored by the Academy Software Foundation. | A blog announcement or similar communication announcing the graduation of the project. | . Expectations . Graduated Stage projects will have an Annual Review to assess if the project is still meeting the Graduated Stage requirements. At the Annual Review, the TAC will vote to either: . | Renew the project at the Graduated Stage if it continues to meet those requirements. | Move the project to the Archived Stage. In this case, the trademark and any other assets will be returned to the project maintainers or an organization they designate. | . For the first Annual Review after the project reaches the Graduated Stage, it is expected that the project has completed 100% of the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge requirements at the gold level with the exception of the requirements listed above.

    "content": "A basic premise behind the Linux Foundation, the Academy Software Foundation, and open source in general, is that most interactions are positive-sum. No fixed amount of investment, mindshare, or development contributions are allocated to specific projects. Just as open source development is based on the idea that we are collectively smarter than one any of us, open source foundations work to make the entire community better off. Equally important, a neutral home for a project and community fosters this positive-sum thinking. It drives growth and diversity, core elements of a successful open-source project. Organizations and projects come to the Academy Software Foundation to… . Have a vendor-neutral home for the project and assets. Groundbreaking and game-changing projects are a collective effort across organizations. Hosting at Academy Software Foundation ensures a project has a reputable legal home and governance to attract contributors and adoption. | All projects are set up as 501c6 Series LLC legal entities, giving the project a non-profit status and autonomy to set their policies and processes with expert guidance. | To ensure neutral management, the project has access to Academy Software Foundation-owned infrastructures such as mailing lists, websites, and domain names. | Academy Software Foundation project lifecycle guides the project to establish a sustainable project. | . Bring in contributors from different organizations ( including your competitors ) . Shared R&amp;D with a broad ecosystem means bringing more contributors and maintainers into your project - including your competitors. | Our staff works with the project to establish open, neutral governance that makes roles clear and paths to leadership available. | All projects have a Code of Conduct to ensure collaboration in a safe and welcoming environment. | Outreach done through the Academy Software Foundation is done from a neutral perspective, separating product promotion and vendor favoritism and promoting the community’s work. | . Drive broad industry awareness with the press and analysts. Your project will get broad motion picture, visual effects, tech, and open source exposure through our large audience, extensive media outreach partnerships with publications such as Linux.com and TFiR, and key partners. | Your project will be featured on both the Academy Software Foundation and the Linux Foundation websites. | Always available guest blog post(s) on the Academy Software Foundation blog on project updates. | Post one technical article about an open-source project you care about to Linux.com, which has over 1 million unique visitors per month. | As appropriate, support your announcements with social outreach and quotes from Linux Foundation and Academy Software Foundation leadership. | Access to opportunities for contributed articles, videos, podcasts, and events | . Build a downstream ecosystem for open and commercial solutions. Sustainable projects are those the industry adopts and drive economic value with. Doing this at Academy Software Foundation takes advantage of the expertise in building these programs. | Conformance programs with community requirements that the Academy Software Foundation Projects manage. | Training and certification programs through LF Training. | Badging using Credly to recognize individuals. | Events such as Open Source Days and Open Source Forum for the community to connect and collaborate. | . Have world-class tools for measuring project insights and success. LFX Insights is an analytics tool for all open-source projects hosted by the Linux Foundation. Its capabilities include the following: . | Getting the visibility you need to remove bottlenecks at any stage of your project’s code pipeline. Drill down into performance metrics across every step in the development lifecycle to identify where you should focus your resources. | Ensuring the health and viability of the open-source projects you care about. Leverage data to help validate undertakings for investment and track the activity and growth of projects your organization is already involved in. | Showcasing your organization’s leadership and subject matter expertise in the open source community. Leverage affiliations to measure the impact of your employees’ contributions and capture the complete picture of your team’s impact | . LFX Security is a tool for managing security for your project. Its capabilities include the following: . | Monitoring your entire project for potential vulnerabilities with an aggregated project-level view of your entire software sandwich across source control systems and repositories, with the ability to remediate the found issues. | Identifying non-inclusive language and code secrets in your project to prevent embarrassing situations. | . Leverage the collective experience and expertise of the Linux Foundation. Academy Software Foundation staff collectively have decades of experience driving open-source projects and ecosystems in various vertical and horizontal industries, bringing the best practices to your project. | Press relations and analyst relations teams to increase awareness of and excitement about your project and receive regular reports on press mentions and comparisons to similar projects. | Academy Software Foundation can leverage the expertise of its parent organization, The Linux Foundation, which hosts other successful projects, including the Linux kernel, Let’s Encrypt, and Node.js. | You will have access to full-time Academy Software Foundation staff eager to assist your project in myriad ways and help make it successful. | .

Successful projects bring diverse organizations and participants together; our experiences at the Linux Foundation and in open source tell us that a diverse community drives greater outcomes and innovation. As a vendor-neutral entity, the Academy Software Foundation creates that level playing field to drive leveraged, open collaboration. In evaluating projects to be hosted at the Academy Software Foundation, the TAC generally has these considerations when evaluating a project. | Does the project address a common problem in the motion picture and visual effects industries that is not solved by other efforts? | Does the project have broad adoption across film production studios, software vendors, and related organizations, or is there a clear path to that adoption? | Will the project have the potential to gain alignment and participation amongst multiple constituents, including software vendors, studios, and other related organizations, to participate as contributors and maintainers? | Is the project’s leadership best positioned and capable of growing the project? | For a project proposed at the Incubation Stage or a project proposed at Sandbox Stage that would grow into an Incubation Stage project, could the TAC invest in helping it succeed? | What resources would the project need to be successful, and does the Academy Software Foundation have the ability to attract and retain those resources? | Will this project divert away resources from existing project(s)? | What existing code is coming into the project, and what potential code could come? | Does the project currently have the feature set, robustness, and scalability necessary to adequately solve the problem for film production, or else is there (a) a clear roadmap to get to that point and (b) a team assembled with the skills and experience to successfully execute the plan? | .

    "content": "The “LF Way”, which is aligned with how the Academy Software Foundation operates, is that there is no one way. The Academy Software Foundation assumes that each open source project is different in its own way, which leads to building a unique governance and solution to sustain their communities. Requirements to host a project here . The project must: . | Use an approved OSI open-source license. | Be supported by a TAC member. | Allow neutral ownership of project assets such as a trademark, domain, or GitHub account (the community can define and manage rules). | Technical “do-ocracy” and separation of business governance from technical governance (we’re flexible on the model) are clearly documented (which we can help you establish). | Allow anyone to participate in the technical community, whether or not a financial member or supporter of the project. | . Often projects are new open-source projects, but that isn’t a requirement - existing projects are welcome! . Project Preparation Checklist . | Prepare draft mission and scope statement. | Identify internal teams within the mission and scope. | Identify developers internally | Analyze code for identification of licenses, license quality, and project dependencies | Assess the potential universe of project participants. Identify ecosystem constituents and concerns of each. | Identify any trademarks leveraged by the project (these will be owned by the LF neutrally) | Outline infrastructure, marketing any other requirements needed for the project. | Complete the project proposal and submit it to the TAC for consideration | . The Academy Software Foundation staff is happy to engage and advise during this process - let us know how we can help! . What happens next? . Once the TAC Chairperson reviews the proposal, the LF Staff will follow up with the prospective project to begin the pre-TAC proposal processes listed below. | Complete and approve the Technical Charter and agree to transfer any relevant trademarks to The Linux Foundation or its affiliate, LF Projects, LLC, and to assist in filing for any relevant unregistered ones. | Have a successful license scan with any critical issues remedied. | Provide administrator access to all project tools, such as it’s GitHub organization, collaboration and communicaton tools, and build/testing infrastructure. | . Generally, the TAC will schedule project proposals at the following TAC Meeting, provided there is at least one week between the submitted project proposal and the scheduled TAC meeting. Proposed projects will have a 30-minute presentation timeslot at an upcoming TAC meeting as the schedule allows. The project proposal must include a presentation conforming to the structure below to ensure uniform and complete submissions. | Overview of the project and its purpose . | If a project is new, it’s often helpful to share the vision for the project, the anticipated structure, and benefits. | If the project is an existing open-source project proposed to join ASWF, it is often helpful to schedule a project walkthrough for the community to understand better the project, including the architecture, structure, and how to get started using the project. This often helps review progress more efficiently. | . | How does this submission support the Academy Software Foundation Mission and Vision statements? | Does the project have any users? . | How do you plan to attract users if accepted? | . | How many committers will you have upfront, and from which companies? . | How do you plan to attract committers and contributors if accepted? | . | Demo and/or walk-through of the project | . Key things to keep in mind for project proposals to the TAC . | The TAC may consider the project for approval at the proposed stage during the meeting it is presented at, provided a quorum of TAC voting members are present. If there is no quorum of TAC voting members present or if the TAC is not ready to consider the project for approval during the meeting, the TAC will either: . | Conduct a vote to approve the project via email, or | Continue the discussion via email or Slack, or during a future TAC meeting. | . | Projects accepted at the Incubation Stage are generally mature, stable projects that have existed for many years. Projects that are newly forming or incomplete should propose to join at the Sandbox Stage. | It’s rare to see a project accepted at the Adopted Stage, as even incoming projects that have existed for years require a fair amount of governance and operations changes as they come into the Academy Software Foundation; those projects tend to come in at the Incubation level and move to Adopted within a year. | The TAC may ask for the project to go back and address specific questions and/or concerns and then re-propose the project. Any project that the TAC has not approved, or any project that the TAC does not renew, can only re-propose the project with the approval of the TAC. | . ",

To start, there may be an appointed list, but over time, more individuals may join the TSC according to the policies the TSC set for adding new members. Regardless, TSC meetings are generally open to anyone interested unless there are sensitive issues to discuss, necessitating a private meeting. LFX Project Control Center is a tool for managing project committees and roles within a project. Each project will be set up in that tool with a voting committee named ‘Technical Steering Committee (TSC)’ notating the project chairperson and all voting members. Project chairpersons, in addition to the Linux Foundation staff supporting the project, will have access to manage this. Additionally, each project has a GitHub Team set up which will provide ‘Maintain’ permission for each project maintainer. Generally, the LF staff will have this set up for each project; after that, the project is expected to maintain any changes. More details on using LFX Project Control Center for committee management can be found in the LFX documentation. Adding New Members . The TSC can add members at any time with a simple majority vote of the current TSC members. The vote can be held during a regular TSC meeting, via email, or as part of a GitHub Issue; either way, it is crucial to have a documented vote for adding the individual with the votes recorded. You should also save this vote in the TSC records for future reference to provide full transparency into TSC member selection.

Secretary . The Secretary records all meeting notes for TSC members and ensures they are distributed to the project community after the meeting in a timely manner. Often, projects have a rotating secretary role instead of a permanent role. Additional roles . TSCs often add additional roles on an as-needed basis to manage different areas or functions within a project.

Roles we’ve seen in a project include but aren’t limited to… . | Chief Architect | Security Lead | Release Manager | Documentation Lead | . Transitioning Roles . Individuals in project roles change from time to time, and it’s important to have both a transparent selection process and ensure all relevant permissions are transitioned to the new role owner. In general, TSCs should follow the following process when transitioning roles: . 1) Define an election or selection process for the role.

All TSC meetings are considered open to the public unless there is a sensitive issue to discuss ( in the case of private meetings, Linux Foundation staff should be present at such meetings ). It’s recommended to schedule meetings on a regular cadence ( for example, every other week at 2:00 pm US Pacific Time ). Many project communities alternate TSC meeting times if project members are globally dispersed ( for example, one time that is US Eastern/Europe friendly and another that is US Pacific/Asia/Australia friendly ). Scheduling logistics . Using LFX Project Control Center, you can easily schedule one-off or recurring meetings that automatically send invites to TSC members, allow other interested parties to register for meetings, and record and make them available for others. Additionally, it provides excellent statistics for meeting attendance, which can help you assess member engagement. More details on using LFX Project Control Center for meeting management can be found in the LFX documentation. For public meetings, LFX PCC provides a public link for sharing the meeting with non-attendees so they can register. It’s recommended that that link be made available publicly. Agenda . The TSC Chairperson should share an agenda at least 24 hours before the meeting with an ask to share additional agenda items. The agenda should be shared through the public communication/collaboration channels they use ( such as mailing lists, chat channels, GitHub, etc ). ",

    "content": "Q: Is a TSC member required to have their employer be a member of the Academy Software Foundation? . A: No - All technical community work, such as projects and working groups, is open to anyone to participate and not bound by membership in the Academy Software Foundation. Q: Does a person lose their membership in a TSC if they leave or change employers? . A: No - TSC membership is bound to an individual, not an organization. If a change of employment for a TSC member results in a key contributing organization lacking TSC representation, the TSC may invite a new TSC member affiliated with that organization, provided that person meets any requirements for TSC membership. Q: Does an individual serving on the TSC represent themselves, the project, and/or their employer? . A: As TSC members are individuals within the context of a TSC, it’s expected that all their actions are for the general good of the project itself. It’s not appropriate to use the project for anti-competitive purposes nor to discuss a TSC member employer’s product plans and roadmap in conjunction with the project planning. Q: Could a project start working groups or sub-committees within their project? . Yes, projects can establish working groups or sub-committees ( herein referred to as ‘subgroups’ ) and do not need to change their Technical Charter to accommodate. When thinking about starting a new subgroup, generally, projects tend to follow a few key factors: . | Is this initiative big enough, with a long enough timeline (6+ months usually, or ongoing is also ok) | Will this initiative require a level of collaboration and discussion that is not possible in the general TSC meeting? | Should this initiative involve folks not on the TSC? | Is this a high priority for the project? | . If the answer to all or most of these questions is yes, a subgroup is a good idea. Each project can develop its own specific process around establishing subgroups. Generally, projects should align with the following key points: . | It’s best practice to have a TSC member as either the leader or, at minimum, a defined member of the subgroup. This person is responsible for the group’s operation, meetings, and communication with the larger TSC about progress. | Each subgroup should have a charter. This can be a simple one-pager, outlining the purpose, goals, non-goals, and deliverables of the subgroup. The TSC should approve this charter Just like TSC Meetings, subgroup meetings must be open to anyone interested in participating. Someone should be tasked with taking notes for each subgroup meeting that capture key discussion points and action items. | Evaluate the subgroups on a regularly scheduled basis, and try not to keep them around indefinitely. Once their larger goals have been achieved, they can be folded back into normal TSC operations. | . ",

    "content": "Generally, meetings provisioned using LFX Meeting Management are relatively straightforward to run. Here are a few tips that might be helpful. Screen sharing guidelines and recommendations . Zoom has documentation on how to use thier screen sharing feature: . Recommendations: . | Turn off notifications to prevent any interference. | Close all sensitive documents and unrelated programs before sharing the screen e.g., Emails. | Test your presentation beforehand to make sure everything goes smoothly. | Keep your desktop clean. Make sure there are no offensive or/and distracting background. | . Audio/Video quality recommendations . While video conferencing has been a real boon to productivity, many things can go wrong during a conference video call. Some things are just plain out of your control, but there are some things that you can control. Here are some tips if you’re getting into remote meetings. Keep in mind that sometimes things break. These are not hard rules, more of a set of loose guidelines on how to tip the odds in your favor. Recommended hardware to have . | A dedicated microphone - This is the number one upgrade you can do. Sound is one of those things that can immediately change the quality of your call. If you plan on being here for the long haul, something like a Blue Yeti will work great due to the simplicity of using USB audio and having a hardware mute button. Consider a pop filter as well, if necessary. | A Video Camera - A bad image can be worked around if the audio is good. Specific models have noise-canceling dual microphones, which are an excellent backup for a dedicated microphone or if you are traveling. | A decent set of headphones - Personal preference; these reduce audio feedback in larger meetings. | . What about an integrated headset and microphone? This depends on the type. We recommend testing it with a friend or asking for recommendations for which models work best. Hardware we don’t recommend . | Earbuds. Generally speaking, they are not ideal, and while they sound acceptable to you when 50 people are on a call, the ambient noise adds up. Some people join with earbuds, which sounds excellent; others join, and it sounds terrible. Practicing with someone ahead of time can help you determine how well your earbuds work. | . Conduct and Moderation . Since the Zoom meetings are open to the general public, a Zoom host or co-host has to moderate a meeting in all senses, from starting and stopping the meeting to acting on Code of Conduct issues. Academy Software Foundation adheres to its Code of Conduct or the relevant project code of conduct throughout all platforms and includes all communication mediums. If you’re dealing with a troll or bad actor: . | Put the troll or bad actor on hold. The participant will be put into a “waiting room” and unable to participate in the call until the host removes the hold. | Remove the participant. Please be cautious when testing or using this feature, as it is permanent. They will never be able to come back into that meeting ID on that particular device. Do not joke around with this feature; putting the attendee on “hold” and removing it is better. | After an action has been taken, use the lock meeting feature so that no one else can come into the meeting. If that fails, end the call immediately, and submit a support request to report the issue. | . NOTE: You can find these actions when clicking on the more or “…“ options after scrolling over the participant’s name/information. Make sure whoever is running your meeting is equipped with the proper knowledge and skills. Hosts must be comfortable using these moderation tools and the Zoom settings. If you have any questions or concerns, reach out to the LF Staff, and they can provide further guidance and training.

This is a common problem. The meeting co-host can help with muting noisy attendees before it becomes too disruptive. You can help a teammate by mentioning it on Zoom chat or asking them to mute the call. Don’t feel bad if this happens to you; it’s common. | Try to find a quiet meeting place to join from; some coworking spaces and coffee shops have a ton of ambient noise that won’t be obvious to you but will be to other people in the meeting. Consider delegating to another person in a quieter environment when presenting to large groups. | Using your computer’s built-in microphone and speakers might work in a pinch, but generally will perform better than a dedicated headset/microphone. | A simple thumbs-up can go a long way! Consider using visual signals to agree to points, so you don’t have to mute/unmute often during a call. This can be especially useful when people ask for lazy consensus. | It is common for people to step on each other when there’s an audio delay and both parties are trying to communicate something. Don’t worry; remember to try and pause before speaking, or consider raising your hand (if your video is on) to help the host determine who should speak first. | .
