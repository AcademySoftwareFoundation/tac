ASWF Project Best Practices -- Overview
=======================================

The contents of this directory contain best practices guides for ASWF
projects. Nothing here is mandatory (at least, not simply by virtue of being
documented here). But this area is meant to provide what we believe is the
best current advice for projects.

Some suggested best practices for the best practices guides:

- Use MarkDown. Name the files intuitively, use lower case and underscores
  between words.
- These are living documents. Please -- especially project leads -- feel free
  to amend guides or add new guides via PR to the tac repo.
- You don't need to spell everything out in gory detail. Often, it is
  sufficient to list practices in an overview or bullet-point style, with each
  one providing a link to a specific implementation in a project we think has
  done it especially well, which can then provide enough of an example to be
  replicated.
- Point out parts that are likely to need project-specific preferences or
  needs (such as projects having different requirements for the minimum number
  of reviewers approving a PR).
- When projects approach something differently, it's helpful to point out
  briefly how different projects do it: "OpenEXR did X, MaterialX did Y,
  and OpenVDB did Z."
