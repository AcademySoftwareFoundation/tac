# Project Accounts

Many projects at the {{ site.foundation_name }} will use different accounts and services for their project operations. As a policy, the Linux Foundation must have an ownership level account on all these accounts and services to ensure continuity and neutral ownership. In general, the Linux Foundation is not involved in the day-to-day operations of these tools, leaving it for the project to manage.

# How to provide the LF Staff access

Please [submit a request]({{ site.helpdesk_url }}) to have a project account or service connected to the Linux Foundation. Common services include:

- PyPi 
- DockerHub
- Cloud Service ( such as AWS, GCP, Azure, etc ). 
- Social Media Accounts ( such as X, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc ).

# Access

Linux Foundation staff will generally use separate credentials to access these accounts and services if available. If not, the shared credentials will be stored in the {{ site.foundation_name }} [1Password Teams account](https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source). Those credentials are restricted to LF Staff, the project's TSC Chairperson, and any other individuals designated by the project's TSC Chairperson.

To request credential access, please [submit a request]({{ site.helpdesk_url }}).
