# Credential Management

To maintain all credentials for community resources in a secure manner, the Academy Software Foundation uses [1Password Teams](https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source). This credential store contains usernames and passwords for services such as:

- Build Infrastructure
- Community social accounts

## Access

Access to the primary vault is restricted to TAC/TSC/Working Group chairs only. The project may have additional vaults with project-specific credentials restricted to only designated individuals by the project's chairperson.

LF Staff has access to all vaults in case project maintainers lose access or are no longer available.

To get access, please [submit a request][] for credential access.
