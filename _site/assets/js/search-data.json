    "content": "Mr. Dolan introduced himself to the group and gave an overview of the technical community and structure of the ASWF, along with the role of the TAC. Each of the initial TAC voting members introduced themselves. Mr. Dolan presented a plan for TAC Chairperson elections, there were no questions or concerns from the TAC members. Mr. Ha presented an overview of the technical infrastructure. The following questions came up: . | Mr. Vera raised a question in regards to the DCO signoff process, if there is anything else needed to be done outside of the DCO signoff on the commits. Mr. Dolan indicated there wasn’t, and further indicated that the DCO isn’t a CLA which requires a formal agreement and process. | There were questions around the support of CLAs with ASWF projects. Mr. Dolan indicated that the legal committee should review the needs, and also indicated that the LF does have a system for managing this if needed. | There was a question on bringing third party dependencies into the project build processes, whether they are projects inside the ASWF or out. Mr. Ha said that inside ASWF project can leverage nexus and for third party projects the code will be pulled into nexus as well. | . Mr. Dolan walked through the project lifecycle and proposal process for review. The following questions came up: . | There was a discussion of how to make the community aware of this process. Mr. Dolan indicated that typically the lifecycle and proposal template would be posted online, and that applying projects would email the TAC to do proposals. | There was a question of using a separate email list for proposals. Mr. Warnicke advised on not creating a separate list. Others suggested a JIRA issue to track the process. | . Mr. Dolan opened up the proposal for comments via Google Docs at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dff0iXigSGj-11-nbmriQhtU73ey8TUqjnHIMcgTw40/edit , indicating that many projects are ready to move through the process. All TAC members said that we should start using this process with the initial projects and use that to gather feedback on the process. Mr. Dolan indicated that Mr. Mertic would follow up over email to coordinate meeting cadence, with weekly meetings to start. ",

Henry Vera said he would like to add some comments to the document now that it’s in GitHub. Andrew and Bill presented the OpenVDB Proposal. The following feedback came from the TAC: . | There were questions raised around patent implications. Mike Dolan indicated that a legal committee should review this and come back with a suggested response. | There were questions around dependency management for a project, and if the TAC should have a role here. Mike Dolan indicated that each project should manage this indivudually because they can change from release to release. | There were questions on the resource costs to the project. Andrew indicated that he would share those and Thanh would review. | Andrew also indicated that the internal code checks and processes would be contributed. | There was also discussion of the desire to improve code quality with the move under the AWSF. | There was a question of whether in makes sense to change the license. Mike Dolan indicated the TAC could at the time of the project coming in, but this could delay the process. | . There was some additional discussion on having open source projects included have commerical license dependencies. Mike Dolan raised concerns on the CI/build Infrastructure being more complicated with commericial dependencies, and the TAC then discussed forming a group to investigate this more. John Mertic brought forward a motion to approve OpenVDB as an Incubation project. Kimball motioned, Henry seconded, and all voted in favor. ",

Andrew indicated that a CLA would still be used, but the plan is to translation to an LF standard CLA. Andrew indicated that there weren’t plans to change the license at this point, but the LCC TSC may choose to do this as part of the LCC being formed. Daniel asked about resource needs for the AWSF TAC to track in regards to this project, which Andrew indicated that he would assess. There was a question around other projects being accepted. John indicated that there is no blocker for other projects to be reviewed while OpenVDB is in the process of reviewing. Gordon and other TAC members indicated that it would great to see these projects proposed as quickly as possible. David Morin indicated that OpencolorIO would be a project likely to be added alongside Sony joining ASWF. OpenVDB said it won’t appoint a TAC representative until it holds it’s initial TSC meetings. There was additional discussion on having a standard/recommended licensing and contribution process for all projects. John indicated in general that it would be something for Daniel to recommend to the Governing Board on creating a standard licensing and contribution scheme, but many established projects would have difficulty in adopting. Daniel gave an update on the working group investigating build/CI for projects needing non-open source dependencies. Thanh indicated it would be best to start the process by bringing in OpenVDB as the first project to determine the specific needs and job evalution. There was further discussion on build assets and build matrix. ",

    "content": "Andrew gave an update on OpenVDB, indicating that they are still iterating on the charter and the plan is to present the resource needs to the Governing Board for approval. There was discussion on the resource needs which OpenVDB indicated they are working through the details on. Thanh indicated that Windows build should be almost ready, working with OpenEXR to prove out the model. There was a question around if Jenkins could size out the builders for a given project; Thanh showcased the options that the cloud provider has at https://vexxhost.com/public-cloud/servers, as well as talking about the Jenkins configuration for which type of build node a Jenkins job would use. Mike Dolan asked Thanh to elaborate on the full costs and scope around CI infrastructure for a given project; Thanh said the starting point would be 10 builders and if that needs to be increased the TAC would need to review the need and costs. Thanh said the cloud provider indicated it could have GPUs available for builders and asked the TAC for guidance on the project requirements for GPUs. OpenVDB indicated they didn’t have present requirements but downstream users of the code have built extensions that leverage a GPU. Daniel said that the group should evaluate the specific project needs, but generally said a recent NVidia GPU would generally work. There was further discussion on details, and Thanh said he would work with the cloud provider for a proof of concept. There was an update on the EULAs for the builds; the Autodesk EULA should be able to be used for the builds. Larry Gritz has started the proposal for OpenColorIO, and indicated that the initial focus is completing internal approval for membership first before submitting the proposal. There was no update for OpenEXR, but attendees indicated they believe the proposal is in progress. Daniel indicated that the VFXPlatform working group has invited a TAC representative to join, and asked to contact him offline if they wish to fill that role. John Mertic shared that new TAC projects should use the Apache 2 license with a DCO if it is a net-new project ( per the charter guidelines ) and the TAC should carefully considering asking new projects to change licenses due to the high burden on the project. All TAC members generally agreed with this approach. David Morin said the IBM had interest in bringing a blockchain project forward and one with CHAOSS that has interest of being under the ASWF, asking if there is guidance on projects suitablity of a given project. There was some discussion that projects don’t have to specifically be code, but it should advance the goals of the ASWF. ",

Daniel indicated he believed that should work, but would need the OpenVDB project to confirm. No new news from OpenEXR and OpenColorIO project proposals, both are waiting on thier respective companies internal processes. Daniel shared that David Morin has been asked by the Governing Board to fill the role of Executive Director of the ASWF. David shared a few words on the background and the role he is filling, specifically around strategy, project recruitment, and fundraising. Brian from Google shared that Google would offer free cloud infrastructure if the AWSF would choose to use it. There was no one coming forward to serve as the TAC rep to serve on VFX Reference Platform Working Group. There was discussion on projects to adopt into ASWF, encouring net new projects that AWSF could bootstrap in the community. There was discussion of ImageIO, including it’s participation in Google Summer of Code. John indicated that the ASWF might consider running it’s own project if it wishes to more directly manage the process, and agreed to share examples via email after the meeting. OpenTimelineIO was suggested by David Morin, which others agreed is a good candidate project. David Morin agreed to follow up with the current project owners to check thier interest. Daniel suggested moving the meeting to a fortnightly basis, which all agreed to. All agreed to look at time adjustments at future meetings. There was some discussion of other academic opportunities to investigate, which Daniel said should continue discussion on on the mailing list. ",

    "content": "Andrew Pearce presented the OpenVDB Technical Charter and CLA for formal approval. The reasons for requiring a CLA were explained primarily as making explicit an organisation’s consent for the contributions of its employees. The Linux Foundation minimal CLA was chosen. There was discussion of the benefits and costs of CLAs and the likely scenarios for CLAs for future ASWF projects. Larry noted that Sony currently uses an umbrella CLA for contributions to all of its OSS projects; organisations may choose to restrict this to particular projects if they desire. Mike Dolan outlined experiences from other projects which suggested a mixture of three models will emerge for ASWF projects: no DCO, Apache CLA for Apache licenced projects, and LF minimal CLA for other licences. Daniel suggested that the TAC might request the Governing Board refer general CLA guidance to the ASWF legal committee. The TAC voted unanimously to accept the OpenVDB Technical Charter and CLA. ",

    "content": "Daniel gave an update from the Governing Board, sharing that Warner Brothers and Sony have both joined. Daniel also shared that the Governing Board has a goal of 6 projects accepted into the ASWF by October next year. There was continued on the licensing/CLA recommendations for incoming projects. John said he would put together a recommendation for incoming projects and licensing/CLA usage. Daniel welcomed JF Panisset to the TAC and asked for the TAC to approve him as an industry voting representative for the TAC. Daniel motioned, Andrew seconded, and it was unanimously approved. Daniel asked if the TAC should publish the template project Technical Charter in TAC github, and to request all new projects publically publish thier techincal charters as well. All in attendance agreed. Andrew shared that OpenVDB has been moved over to the ASWF, and the next step is achieving a CII Best Practices badge. John said he can work with DreamWorks on how to achieve that badge. Thanh reported good progress and testing with the GPU, and was looking to formalize this. OpenEXR update indicated the ILM legal and procedural process is still ongoing. OpenColorIO update from Larry indicated that legal meetings are going well and he is working with the community itself for building the charter. OTio update from Cory indicated they are still working out the governance processes, and hopes to have an update at the next meeting. Daniel shared that the offer using Google Cloud was deemed to complex to take advantage of, and will not be pursuing this. Daniel discussed a project to have the ASWF CI build out the VFX Reference Platform. Thanh discussed some options using packer or having a third party project repo for sharing them. Daniel suggested a follow up conversation in a working group to discuss this further. ",

Larry elaborated on the CMakeTools project that he introduced on the TAC mailing list. There was support and encouragement for the project. Kimball described another possible project to provide decoding and processing of camera raw images. Existing projects in the area such as dcraw and libraw were discussed as was the importance of maintaining and recognising the contributions of these projects. Daniel highlighted the opportunity to involve camera manufacturers directly in this project via the ASWF. Work from John and the Linux Foundation in providing clear background and guidance on ASWF LIcense and CLA questions was raised in the form of an open PR on the TAC github.

    "content": "The first OpenVDB TSC meeting has taken place, along with formal recognition of the project chair and committers. CII badge certification continues to be a challenge, requiring unfamiliar tools and questions about how to report “known issues”. Sonar Qube has previously been proposed as a component of the ASWF CI which can provide the necessary analysis tools, which will be followed up in the CI Working Group. Larry provided an update on the OpenColorIO proposal, which has progressed to drafts for the proposal documents under internal review prior to submission. Further templates and guidelines to assist project proposal and adoption have been prepared by John with the input of others. The group agreed that these are ready to merge on the TAC github. Daniel summarized some of the first year goals that had been proposed for the ASWF during the last board meeting. The most relevant for the TAC is the goal to have 6 projects accepted by September 2019. David expanded on this and offered to present a slide at the next meetings. The 6 projects would require new projects to be created or identified beyond the original 3 candidates (OpenVDB, OpenColorIO, OpenEXR). JF noted that the TAC should refer to the industry OSS survey by the VES’s Sam Richards during the ASWF formation process. ",

    "content": "Daniel introduced Ken to the group as the OpenVDB representative to the TAC. Ken gave background on himself and an update on the OpenVDB project. Ken indicated that AutoDesk reached out in the past week to see if there is interest in bringing in some of thier technology into OpenVDB; the TSC is reviewing and determining if there is a fit. There was some discussion on the copyright notices in the files themselves and the status of the CI and build system. Larry presented the OpenColorIO project for inclusion at the Incubation stage, walking through the application sent via the email list. Since there was no quorum, Daniel suggested to take the vote via email once Larry has the charter ready as well. OpenEXR had no updates, still working through legal review. No updates from CMakeTools either. David presented the year 1 goals for the ASWF. David shared that the group could meeting in February in person if they wish; Daniel said he would discuss via email with the group to gauge interest. Daniel asked TAC meetings to review the list of projects identified during the formation process as possible projects to include ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p3bmPhhoXZoKQHYhVI9xbuXFlUq8kcg67Ws1yE70L6o/edit#gid=0 ). Daniel gave an update on the CI Working Group, indicated there is some documentation and tooling established for building the VFX Platform. Daniel also shared that there is some exploration for static analysis tools, and discussion ensued on the requirements for such tools. ",

    "title": "Packer config to build VFX Reference Platform (Aloys)",
    "content": ". | Packer, Docker, OpenStack . | Conan.io . | Aloys’ branch : use Docker to build TBB, Boost, IlmBase . | Probably not a scalable solution for supporting multiple packages that can be distributed . | AL has been using Rez for many years with a lot of success, but move to VFX Reference Platform 2018 showed that moving to new compiler toolchain is difficult in Rez . | Conan has more flexible way of working with multiple compiler toolchains, OS platforms. | Conan uses a hash to capture the environment you used (tools, build options…) so you can identify a binary based on its hash . | Conan has good documentation, was able to make use of it mostly from docs and sample code with minimal Stack Overflow googling . | Haven’t created a PR yet, since for now it’s more an experiment for discussion purposes . | Found working recipes for TBB, Boost, OpenEXR, what was found online wasn’t always up to our requirements. | Aloys feels that whereas Rez remains essential to deploying software in studios, Conan may be workable solution to building software, and eventually it may be possible to make the two interoperate. | Thanh asked “why do we want to create a separate OpenEXR job / artifact when we already have a separate job in the CI infrastructure”: Aloys sees that maintaining the OpenEXR project itself may be a somewhat separate goal from maintaining a VFX Reference Platform compliant OpenEXR build / distribution. We should clarify those goals and how we should create Jenkins jobs to fill these goals. Thanh suggests we reuse the same OpenEXR job templates from the official OpenEXR project with a different “stream” for VFX Reference Platform. Many LF projects use “streams” to build certain branches / LTS release, so OpenEXR project could have streams based on major versions, and there could be a “stream” for VFX Reference Platform builds / versions. This allows work on job templates from the main project to be reused. Aloys started trying to use that mechanism by using “vfx2018” as the stream name for the 2018 VFX Reference Platform. | Aloys used Docker containers to build under CentOS 7 (with Ubuntu as the Docker host). | Daniel: what are the impacts of introducing a new technology like Conan in a build environment (learning curve for instance, impact on the facility). Rez / Conan can be quite “opinionated”. Experience at Animal Logic is that Rez can be difficult to implement in a CI environment. Conan may be cleaner for that purpose. | CMake-based project suggest may introduce fewer dependencies, but scalability with large number of packages becomes an issue. | Trevor: how does this interact with needing multiple versions of the Reference Platform support multiple Maya versions? Aloys: Conan can do this in a non-opinionated way, you can declare your dependencies up front, it will generate a CMake file with the paths you need, you can invoke that in your own CMake file. Conan doesn’t handle deployment to the end user (that would probably be done by Rez). Conan can be contained to just the build environment, doesn’t need to impact deployment to the studio. | For a vendor, if they use Conan, the resulting binaries would be packaged in a directory, which can then be zip’ed / packaged in the installer as part of the application. Studios will need a more complex distribution mechanism for their internal uses. | Jeff Bradley: DWA is pretty strict about what code can be pulled into the facility, where would Conan pull code from? Aloys: you can install your own Conan server (open source), so no dependency on Internet. Can configure your remote repos to be internal or external. Conan server is integrated in Artifactory (same developers). | Daniel: asking Larry how this would interact with changes to CMake scripts for instance. From the point of view of a downstream consumer, it seems that Conan would solve problems in better way than Rez and solve a number of real problems, but adds a layer of complexity and learning curve. Larry: not a lot of Conan experience, and believes not many studios do. Feels that not only is the task to get the CI up and running, but to provide a way for studios to effectively consume and manage versions of ASWF software. But we shouldn’t be afraid of the Rez solution since there are long term benefits to going with that. | Aloys, Larry: CMake project is still very useful, and mostly orthogonal project. | Daniel asking Thanh for comments about some of the PRs so far: he doesn’t see any issues with the PR so fars in the context of the LF infrastructure. But if we introduce new tools it needs to be determined who is responsible for managing those looks, and in particular whether the LF team. | Nexus3 does have a Conan plugin, so that could provide an integration point (it isn’t enabled in the current LF infrastructure, open source plugin, not officially supported by the SonaType). Opening a helpdesk ticket is the way to get this work started. | Larry: are the needs of our projects so different than other LF foundations / projects, and is there existing infrastructure that could be leveraged. Thanh: his experience is OpenDaylight which is Java, so very different tools / requirements. There are C/C++ LF projects such as FD.IO, EdgeX (mostly Go, but come C/C++, so would be a good idea to talk to folks on those projects to see if there’s anything we can reuse). Some of these projects are using Docker for their deployments, so they are building end-user containers rather than delivering libraries. | Daniel: our environment heavily relies on heavily nested C/C++ plugins hierarchies, with commercial libraries / host applications, which somewhat differentiates the VFX environment. John says he’s been working in the issue of how to integrate licenses of commercials apps / libraries in an open source environment. | Aloys: Conan seems to want to be the de facto package manager for C/C++ projects, the way npm for Javascript, Pip for Python, and Maven for Java. | . | .

(N/A allowed.)” . | CVSS v2 &gt;= 4 | . | . | . None of these tools provide explicit mapping between their reports with CVSS severity levels. | Example C++ project with CII badge: https://github.com/nlohmann/json . | OpenVDB, OpenEXR projects are working on these issues to achieve this certification. | Jeff: not specifically involved in OpenVDB project, but DWA is evaluating checking for its internal code. Flawfinder is fast, describes which vulnerability it finds. | Larry: working its way through requirements for OpenColorIO, some requirements are not relevant, some are things that were already done. Static analysis is the “big mystery”, unclear how relevant some of the vulnerabilities are, especially in the context of a segregated studio network. But OpenColorIO is incorporated into a lot of third party applications and could become an “attack surface”, so need to do fuzz testing for input formats (LUTs for instance). | John: is the main concern the selection of the tool or how to interpret the results of these tools. Larry: interpretation of reports is fairly straightforward, but the hard part is figuring out which of those reports is relevant, so getting hundreds of reports would result in a large amount of work trying to fix issues which may not be relevant. John: sounds like it may make sense to specify the tooling for static analysis, and is configured at the right “warning level” for the requirements of ASWF projects. Larry: what developers want is something like “here’s the 30 clang-tidy (say) tests that need to be fixed to get the CII badge”. Jeff: hard part is figuring out what level to of severity needs to be set, and rules for fixing issues at different severity levels. | Thanh: currently infrastructure only provides Sonar and NexusIQ, have to use provided templates, currently no Sonar template for C/C++ projects. John: looks like there’s a significant amount of work on the LF engineering side. Thanh: doesn’t believe there’s a lot of existing C/C++ static analysis expertise at LF right now, so ASWF may be leading the way here. | Daniel pinged the CII mailing list about these issues, hasn’t heard back yet. | Daniel: Issue of C/C++ commercial vs open source/community Sonar plugins. The community supported plugin may work best in our environment. | John: LF doesn’t see a lot of C/C++ projects in its foundation projects, mostly Java and Python, but hopefully can provide some expertise. Largest C project is the Linux kernel, but they just publish a tarball, they don’t publish binaries. Companies like RedHat do a lot of the work of static analysis. | . ",

Running clang-tidy with a few disabled checks, lgtm (commercial tool) allows free scans of OSS projects look promising to achieve CII badge. | OpenVDB has looked at more sophisticated tooling and may be able to offer insight (Vericode?). | CII badge requirements are somewhat vague (by design), mainly you sign up to fix medium to high priority security issues that have been reported. Mostly about adhering to coding best practices. | John from LF mentioned the requirement to identify a security expert within the project, which can be challenging. Could it be solved across all projects? | Larry: no formal requirements listed for the “security expert”, is a competent senior software developer sufficient for this role? Is MPAA / TPN familiarity relevant? | Security is important when exchanging data between studios, which is most of what the initial OSS projects concentrate on. | Should we try to reach out to external experts? | Larry: are there resources within the LF? | . | Follow up: Action item from OpenVDB: Nexus IQ scans (LF) | Follow up: Check with Linux Foundation about security expertise | Follow up: Check with Linux Foundation on specifics of designated security expert for each project | Follow up: SideFX Houdini API for CI usage.

Goal is to have common Cmake infrastructure to be shared between project.

Bringing in USD as a CI dependency brings in another dozen dependent projects. | Daniel: is “environment management” a suitable project? For instance the Rez project? Discussed with main author, won’t happen in short term but could be possible. Dependency management has been tackled by every studio, is there room for a “general” solution. | Larry: interested in collaborating on this problem to avoid every studio having to solve that problem on their own. | Carey Philips: looking for specific success stories for ASWF so far. Asking of Ken from OpenVDB: what would you suggest are specific achievements due to the foundation? Ken: before Foundation, OpenVDB was run by one person at Dreamworks, who was overwhelmed. Foundation of governance structure brought contributions from several studios that Dreamworks had not heard of before. Have been approached by commercial partners (Autodesk, Intel, nVidia) more than before. OpenVDB seems to have entered a “new phase”, developers are energized, a very positive experience. Good to hear that actual code has been written and released, not just organizational. WETA’s appetite to contribute to projects has increased because of it. | Larry: what happens if multiple projects from a company are ASWF projects, does each one has to have a separate TAC representative? Should something like the CMake project be a “full scale” project? Maybe we need to define different “levels” of projects. Should follow up with Linux Foundation. | . | . | . ",

How do we solve the immediate CI problem while thinking ahead of how this could be used in facilities. | Rez is different from conan.io, designed as a runtime dependency manager. Initially didn’t support builds, can resolve an environment as quickly as possible, resulting in a set of package versions that don’t conflict with each other. | Rez is not going to be as good as conan for builds since not designed for that, and not designed for managing public, pre-built artefacts, might be out of scope. | Integrating conan into Rez could make sense, could be possible to write Rez definition files to pull artefacts from public conan artefact repos. | There are probably missing components, Allan has ideas of what would be needed to implement and believes it is achievable to have Rez to read Rez package definition files from a public repository. | Aloys: there could be a public ecosystem of packages, and use Rez to access those (similar to pip for Python). | Allan: it may make more sense to have a repository of Rez definition files that know how to pull from conan repos. | Aloys: what happens when packages have similar upstream dependencies . | Allan: could also extend Rez to have the same kind of functionality as conan, but could be too large a project to replicate that functionality. | Larry: studio is contemplating investment into using Rez, if Rez is extended to support build version management and adopted by other studios in context of ASWF it would be a strong selling point. | Jeff: has been playing with Rez in last couple of years to help build open source software, defining dependencies in Rez package files, ran into issues with flags that need to be propagated and which are not documented. Packages expect to be “system installed” and auto-discover dependencies, not configured, so have to fight that. Not all libraries respect LD_LIBRARY_PATH to discover where libraries are (CMake project should help as well). May want to pull zlib from a Rez package for instance. | Allan: Rez doesn’t (yet) manage the boundary between managed packages and packages installed on the system. It should be since Rez is good at runtime resolution. | Aloys: AL has been using Rez in 4-5 years, currently in “pullback” phase where low-level packages like zlib had been Rez-ified under CentOS 6, but under CentOS 7 easier / safer to use system level packages (using Ansible to make sure correct versions are installed). Abstract the configuration of the system via a single Rez package. They found that this helps with “too many Rez packages” which becomes a maintenance burden. | Jeff: currently migrating from RHEL 6 to RHEL 7, abstracting system packages to Rez might help with OS transitions. | Daniel: should the ASWF tackle these type of system-level issues. | Trevor: how should different DCCs with different VFX platform levels / requirements deal with system level vs managed packages. | Allan: could grow into “production management”, i.e. what package should be used for what project, since every studio needs to solve this issue. | . | .

Guidelines are very vague, so we need to agree on specific goals. James (Intel): can also help defining security goals and processes, not just actual development support. Intel has “Security Champions” who could contribute. Gordon Bradley (Autodesk) has similarly “Security Champions”: Autodesk feels the idea of every project have a security expert is unrealistic. Project-specific “Security Champions” can consult with company-wide security experts, deal with handling of specific security issues. Intel agrees with that model. Gordon: 90% of your issues are in external libraries, not your own code, how do you address issues in external libraries. | Daniel: OpenEXR has 12 reported CVEs, so that’s an example | Ken: EXR, VDB are exchange formats which support encoding metadata, so can be vectors for malware. | James: will need some kind of signing process for build artefacts. | Gordon: trying to bullet proof a file format has lots of implications (performance, development effort…), we need to be pragmatic with our investments. May need to define the scope of what we are trying to address. | Larry: may not be able to “hide behind” the idea that studios work behind firewalls: ASWF may cause our projects to gain wider adoption, outside of our restricted environments | Daniel: Apple offered to help with fuzzing | John Mertic (LF) DCO and signing of past commits: git log for past commits, add those to text file, sign off that log of your past commits with DCO. Do you need to chase down all former committers? If all committers are from one company, can nominate a person to sign off all commits from that company. For external contributors, would be good to try to chase them down, or use CLA if there’s automatic assignment. Are there tools to report on DCO coverage of a project? There’s a Ruby command line tool, documented in ASWF documents. Does this need to be done before a project joins the ASWF? For new commits there’s a “DCO Bot” that prevents unsigned commits. LF does a “license scan” of existing code before a project is onboarded (to make sure project is consistently licensed), could add DCO scanning. | Gordon (Autodesk): if one of the goals is to help onboarding projects, how to we make things easier for new projects, and not throw up barriers. How can the ASWF help? We have access to some funding, could pro-actively scan potential projects? | John (LF): they try to highlight potential problems, but different companies may do things differently. For instance handling of copyright statements. LF tries to make license compliance as easy as possible for developers, LF can take care of the “ugly problems”, but they cannot give legal advice. LF does have forums for member legal teams to discuss / collaborate. | Kimball: there is a one line git command to find commits not signed with DCO | Larry: we should have a “best practices guide” aimed at potentials projects / prior to applying / creating new projects from scratch (always easier to do at start). | John (LF): we need to document what we are learning, every open source project is slightly different | .

When a project gets onboarded should we reset the versioning scheme to pick a consistent scheme, best to do now if we are going to do it. | Kimbal: needs to be tied to VFX Reference Platform, which is tied to our CI infrastructure. | Gordon (Autodesk): how do you deal with coupling in revision updates between VFX Reference Platform and individual components. He really likes the idea of a consistent versioning scheme. Also hits the goal of providing a “platform” for new projects. | Ken (OpenVDB): doesn’t like the idea of resetting existing versioning numbers. | Daniel: what is the proliferation at this stage? How many models, for instance USD (YYYY.MM), Linux creates specific scheme (X.Y.Z). | Guido: what does X.Y.Z even mean? Could at least make sure to define what those numbers mean. | John (LF): could align with semantic versioning scheme. This is a part of dependency management, should be not contentious and there’s a chance to fix a “low hanging fruit”. | Daniel: start with semantic versioning. | Ken: OpenVDB is slightly deviating from semantic versioning, they only apply that to the data structure, so change in minor version guarantees backward compatibility for the data files but not the tools. Similar for ACES, sometimes unclear where changes fit within that versioning system. | John (LF): largest issue is API compatibility. | Ken: also care about ABI compatibility. | . | Project Test Data . | Guido (Pixar): how to deal with test data that goes with projects / test suites. There should be a mechanism to include test data in actual libraries for testing and validation, should that be a pre-requisite for acceptance? | Larry: this is a requirement for CII badge. | John (LF): this can be part of the incubation phase.

Should we look for expertise elsewhere? | Doug Walker (autodesk): need help from Linux Foundation to help get infrastructure set up, interface with LF RelEng. | Gordon: they have some Windows expertise, but they would like to keep it on the actual OpenColorIO project, would rather see infrastructure come from LF Infrastructure. | Larry: do any of the member companies have resources? | Matt (Epic): Windows is their primary platform, they will see if they have resources available. | Thanh (LF): happy to join any calls to help getting up Windows infrastructure running. Also Apple is soon to (hopefully) join the ASWF so would be able to help with Mac builds. | James (Intel): OSPRay uses CMake to support all platforms, they make it a point to support all platforms, could this be a model to follow? | Daniel: We also need feedback from Windows / Mac people in studios to ask if support is usable. | Liam Fernandez (Blur Studio): they are mostly Windows based, very interested in helping with Windows build infrastructure. They have also struggled with semantic versioning. | Guido: surprised that Windows CI infrastructure didn’t come from LF? | John (LF): the infrastructure they provide should be configurable by the individual foundations. | Thanh (LF): he’s here to help, the community is there to “lead the charge”. If there are resources LF is not providing, he can go back to see if that can be addressed. | Larry (Sony): foundational projects have a current set of maintainers are Linux centric, need to bring in outside people who can help. | Daniel: we need to take advantage of the offers of support to help with outstanding issues. | . | .

They also have performance flavors of containers, on Enterprise plan we get access to performance systems. Backend is Amazon AWS. | GPU: in Resource Classes you can pick containers with GPU access, similarly for Mac access. Get 1 Mac builder for free for Open Source projects (a certain number of minutes per month). | Windows: CircleCI is currently working on it, would need to do hybrid of CircleCI and AppVeyor until Windows support is available. | Daniel: some differences in configuration between Linux and macOS, how divergent would Windows be? Thanh will check with CircleCI . | Self hosted CircleCI, how is it delivered? It is delivered as AWS Teraform configurations. | https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/oss/ Documentation on how to set up OSS projects, get discount + some free resources. | Cost of Enterprise Plan? Based on number of users and time used, but not charged for users for OSS projects, just amount of time used. | How would that compare to raw costs from AWS (how much do they mark it up)? . | Gordon: what are the implications on all the studios using CircleCI? Thanh: organizations would have to go with the self hosted option. Individual contributors could also use the free tier under their own account. Dan: could be issues if free tier doesn’t have access to GPU instance for instance. | Daniel: CLI utility can be used for local builds, uses Docker for local builds. | Daniel: does moving to a “modern” CI system make it easier to move between different “modern” CI systems? . | Thanh: should we write jobs using Ansible, there is a CI system that uses Ansible Playbooks. What is the minimum amount of bootstraping you need to do in a project to get things going with the CI system, and can we do the rest with Ansible. | Dan did some work to try building OpenVDB on CircleCI: not very difficult to transition from Travis, everything is YAML build, customizable steps are useful, also natively supports build artefacts. They often hit the 50 min build on Travis, 5h limit on Cicle definitely helps. Also somehow CircleCI builds seem quicker.

    "content": ". | Posted survey of package management systems for C++ to mailing list . | Further discussion . | Jeff: DW not planning to use cmake / Conan internally, so they are more in watching mode. Trick to include merge version numbers seems useful. They created a Rez package to compile all packages as debug or non-debug. | Aloys: discussion email thread on survey of package management systems, when building OpenImageIO for instance need to build the right dependencies, need to build upstream dependencies (boost, OpenEXR). Need to choose various “slices” of the build: release, release with debug symbols, version of VFX Reference platform, C++ version, make that available as an artefact. But what if you want a debug build? Package managers typically don’t let you pick and choose various build options. Conan seems pretty good at doing that. Rez variants can also be used for that, but can end up with mix of incompatible variants. | Aloys: a good talk on survey of package managers . | Conda is a more general package manager for the scientific community . | Rez doesn’t have explicit support for storing your packages . | Aloys created Conan repository as an experiment. Conclusion is that we would need to wrap Rez with something else for external package download, whereas Conan supports this out of the box. | Jeff: Rez is not very viable for ASWF CI builds on cloud systems. | Aloys: we could provide a set of Rez recipes which are compatible with the build artifacts we generate. | Dan: what are the ASWF goals with respect to build artifacts? Daniel: CI is the first / foremost goal, but dependency management discussion came up quickly as a key component / requirement of the CI. There is no out of the box solution that everyone agrees on. Every studio has combination of legacy / proprietary tooling, Rez is an industry specific solution to parts of these problems, but doesn’t work all that well with CI / package repository. Dan: could every project build all of its dependencies? Or is sharing dependencies a primary goal? Jeff: not planning to use ASWF artifacts in the short term due to internal requirements. Would love to be able to do so eventually. Daniel: when the LF set up the initial repos they did it as simply as possible, used Linux native packagement to grab dependencies, but quickly ran into the need for dependency management. Aloys: we need guaranteed rather than accidental compatibility, don’t want packages built with slightly different build options (for instance). For instance Autodesk compiles TBB in a specific way, need to make sure you build it the same way, and there’s no well documented build recipe. Sharing those build recipes really helps to make this explicit. | Dan: sees build artefacts as mostly targeting the hobbyist developer, large studios will prefer to build everything from source. Can get tricky for builds that depend on quickly changing dependencies like Houdini daily builds for OpenVDB plugins for instance. | Daniel: challenge from Dan to keep to immediate and tangible goals, especially for projects already in ASWF. OpenVDB currently uses what the OS provides for EXR, Boost (apt-get), but want to better control version of sub components. Need to limit the permutations of the build matrix, one approach is to build with all the latest dependencies, and then do additional build which varies individual components / options. | Daniel: we need a VFX Reference Platform build of OpenVDB as an experiment. Dan: that should be done on top of CircleCI if we decide to move to that. Larry: maybe not wait after the decision to go to Circle, since that work could inform that decision. Dan: for now stuck in Travis “stages”, would rather do that in CircleCI. | Jeff: what needs to happen next to make the decision on moving to CircleCI? Thanh: we can start using the free tier right away. | Larry: we will need some kind of estimate of how much cost will we be looking at. Dan: there’s a tool like that for Travis to get how many build minutes have been used for a project. | Daniel: challenge to formulate a clear, achievable goal, will send email to tac mailing list. | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 1 . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Decided on deprecation strategy: will support current and last 2 years of VFX Reference Platform, helps to transition away from older releases. | Release schedule: new major version Q3 or Q4, 2018 was quite late in the year, but typically around Oct-Nov, bump major version once a year. 7.0.0 in 2019, currently discussing what goes into that release (major releases can change ABI). | Draft GitHub pull request with CircleCI prototype to share with others to show what was needed, not complete, but builds correctly, supports different years of VFX Reference Platform. Waiting on decision of whether we move forward with CircleCI. | Have been using move to ASWF as opportunity to unify some processes, in particular the way they build Houdini SOPs. OpenVDB is shipped with Houdini, so had to deal with vendor-supplied and open source versions, trying to come up with a better way to deal with both sets of SOPs. | Work is continuing with transition to CMake, main focus of CI-related effort. | . | OpenColorIO . | Moving mailing lists to ASWF domain, shutting down old google group next Monday. | OCIO 1.1.1 bugfix release, optional compatibility with OIIO 2, next week or two. First release in a year, well due | Working on resolving embedded external dependencies, blocker on moving the repo over to ASWF. | Working on pairing developers to task, lots of interest in using OCIO v2, but that could be a year away. | Opportunity for member companies to dedicate some engineering time. | Will create GitHub Issues for tasks that need help. | One task is Metal render integration for macOS platform with upcoming OpenGL deprecation. | Recently made strides with ACES compatibility. Implements low level ACES algorithms as code instead of using LUTs. | Also ACES common LUT format is supported in Master branch, needed for official ACES support. Could do intermediate release with ACES compatibility if extra resources available? Maybe not, tied to changes to core renderer. | Daniel: lots of excitement when V2 features announced, also how does this line up with next VFX Reference Platform. Robert: meetings for 2020 starting soon, can bring up issues. | More generally need to coordinate ASWF releases. | Larry: would help to get schedule guidance from VFX Reference Platform to drive development of ASWF projects. | Robert: SIGGRAPH is “unofficial” deadline, but unclear what step this deadline is for. Process is somewhat fluid. Typically draft by SIGGRAPH time, but can entertain later releases with an amendment later in the year. | Larry: ASWF projects should try to line up for similar deadlines to make things easier / simpler, especially given cross project dependencies. | Daniel: opportunity to create a timeframe and process, and build a working prototype of next VFX Reference Platform. | . | . | OpenCue proposal . | https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/topic/project_contribution/29992570 | Vote on adoption (incubation stage) . | Larry: do we need further discussion before the vote happens? Don’t want a “provisional vote” that people would object to. | Bill: would like to see some discussion on it, time to do a deeper investigation on it. Same from Kimball. | Set goal of next TAC meeting for actual vote. Brian: happy to provide additional material, send out development roadmap. | Larry: would be great if Google could share feedback from other sources. | What are the implications on testing? Google has a Jenkins environment for builds from GitHub, but currently not a full, live testing environment. | . | OpenCue currently uses the Apache CCLA and ICLA. Will this move to the LF / ASWF minimal CLA? . | Todd/Brian: still Apache CLA, based on Google legal team recommendation. Could loop in the legal folks. | Larry: OpenColorIO had previously used Apache 2 CLA, switched to variant to minimal LF CLA, reason was that it didn’t make much sense to use Apache 2 CLA with BSD license. But Apache 2 CLA with Apache 2 License probably makes sense. | Daniel: project adoption guidelines advises that there’s no necessity to use Apache 2 CLA, and preference is for minimal CLA. Larry: may be best to stick to license infrastructure agreed to by Sony and Google to streamline the process. | . | What skillset(s) are required to develop, deploy and test the components of OpenCue and the system as a whole? . | Brian (Google): interested in hearing about what specific components of OpenCue may be of concern. | Daniel: Oracle/Postgres stored procedures may not be very familiar. Brian: have been thinking about roadmap to migrate functionality outside of database into code. | Daniel: there seems to be a lack of discussion? | Bill: most ASWF projects so far already have wide industry adoption, is it an issue that OpenCue hasn’t seen wide adoption yet since it is so new. | Brian: this could be the what the incubation phase is for? | Todd: Google took on this project as collaborative project with Sony, but also based on feedback from users of GCP for rendering. Studios want a hybrid cloud / onprem rendering infrastructure and rendering framework. Being part of ASWF should help to drive adoption. Daniel: it’s the chicken/egg problem of driving adoption. | . | What CI coverage is currently in place for automated build and testing, and what are the requirements / costs of this setup? | Is there security expertise currently associated with the project? | ​(For the community) What’s the outlook for broad adoption of OpenCue? . | Mid size facilities very interested, minimize per node costs, one less licensing mechanism to worry about. | Dreamworks doing an eval | AL: OpenCue shows its age (tooling and mechanisms), not necessarily a problem, suitable for scale and applications. Some expertise in databases and database stored procedures may not be so widespread in VFX community. If ASWF adopts, will there be resources to continue to develop and maintain the system. | . | Brian: questions about the legal committee, what is required by the charter. | . | CI updates . | Working group | Discussion on using CircleCI instead of Jenkins with LF releng team, better support for all our target platforms | Challenge from Daniel: use OpenEXR fork as a prototype to implement CircleCI | SonarCloud instead of SonarQube | SideFX download client | . | Security Working Group . | Low response rate, is it a scheduling problem / timezone? Or a problem with resources / expertise / interest? (Doodle pool) | Kimball offers to help | Larry: should figure out who is willing to attend to learn, whereas who is willing to help / have expertise. | Daniel: followed up with people who offered explicit help at face to face meeting in LA, need to follow up again. | . | Common linear algebra library? . | Very good discussion on TAC mailing list | . | Matching resources and developers . | Larry: Came from OpenColorIO, debate in community about releases, dilemma about only 2 developers doing V2 release work, don’t want to be distracted to do a 1.2 release for instance. They also feel that collection of new features go together, don’t want to piecemeal the release of those features. But that can result in a very long release schedule. Additional development resources could help in earlier staging of some of these features. Currently there are more member companies than ASWF projects, and OCIO could use help from developers who are not domain experts. More generally how do we match the resources from member companies with project needs. | Kimball: should we use the “Summer of Code” model for matching needs to resources? Larry: there could be a Wiki where each project could post their top 5 requirements that could use additional / external resources. | Daniel: could be used as an on-ramp for developer level contributions to ASWF projects. | Dan: OpenVDB uses Jira, seems to work well for them. Was surprised at strong feelings against Jira. Doesn’t feel there’s a need to consolidate on single issue tracking system, but Jira works well for them. Could be a link to Jira issues from a Wiki page. GitHub has tags for “good first issues” to help new people approaching a project to pick tasks. | Larry: some projects require a lot of specialized knowledge to make anything but trivial contributions. Dan: hard to identify “simple issues” and not just do it yourself. Larry: projects can also use help with CI-related work, doesn’t require domain knowledge. Mike: setting up static analysis and identifying flagged issues doesn’t require domain knowledge. | . | Update on candidate projects . | OpenEXR | Others?

Early discussions, but decided to go with CircleCI. Can LF releng provide any feedback? | Do they support GPUs? | Dan: what are other people’s thoughts on how to structure their CI configurations? Expectations are that we would have a single build on WIndows and Mac rather than having a large number of tests? Can we just use AppVeyor for simple Windows builds? For now OpenVDB focussing more on Linux. | Patrick: For OpenColorIO the matrix is much more extensive on Linux rather than Windows because AppVeyor is quite slow. We should have extensive builds and unit tests on all platforms, “ideally”. | Daniel: as a first step full matrix on Linux since we have active users and expertise, especially if we have to use other CI systems on non-Linux platforms. But longer term goal is still to generate downloadable builds on all platforms, so will need to support more extensive build matrices on those platforms as well. But for now we should concentrate on a “MVP” focussed on Linux with simple builds on other platforms. | Dan: there should be a convention as to how ASWF projects are set up so it’s not arbitrarily different on all platforms. | . | Are we ready to give up full open source solution / reproducible stack? . | vs SaaS offering | CircleCI is still using Terraform on Amazon | Should this be a voted-on decision? | Dan: What do we need to make a vote, pricing info? Further research on options out there? | Daniel: costs are important, functionality / capabilities, local reproducibility. | JF: Is there an expectation from the paying members of a locally reproducible infrastructure. | Daniel: question to Andrew (LF): is ASWF committed to providing a locally reproducible CI stack, or is that a desirable but not necessary requirement. His understanding is that the original proposal from LF to ASWF member companies would be reproducible in house, which is why they went with Jenkins stack, but also only option that can be done in house. Also part of the original documentation from RelEng team, which got pushed along by ASWF project. If the project pivots to SaaS solutions, the Steering Committee would have to vote on this, since in-house reproducibility was part of the original commitment. | Daniel: Governing Board and TAC meeting coming up before end of months, so this should be brought up there. Different motivations between projects and studios. | Jeff (DW): wasn’t initially expecting to be able to bring CI system in-house and integrate with their system, but their short term expectations was more about recipes for dependencies which they could migrate into their internal processes. Being able to bring in the entire CI process for these projects would be valuable but not necessary. | Andrew: agrees that other studios had similar perspective. | Jeff: current CI configs are not sufficient since they rely on locally installed libraries. | Daniel: ties in to dependency management | . | .

Thanh: this is trailblazing, other LF projects aren’t using those tools. Conan seems similar to Maven for Java projects. | Patrick: consuming binaries in C++ is challenging because of different compilers, different compiler flags… Need a standard on how to build libraries (VFX Reference Platform solves some of this?).

Larry: maybe too early to put on pressure to force commitment to ASWF projects only, but more direct members who currently have unallocated resources. | . | . | Thanh announcement . | Leaving Linux Foundation for a startup | Andrew Grimberg taking over his role for now, is caught up on all issues | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Work focussed on CMake updates, testing with CircleCI | . | OpenColorIO | . | CI updates . | Working group discussions | Some entrants for challenge that was set, no fully complete solutions, but Aloys got close with OpenEXR builds including Conan, CI system itself is a thin layer on top of recipes for package management, sourcing dependencies, and build (CMake) recipes. | Enthusiastic takeup on CircleCI, that style of CI system seems quite appealing. | We discussed other approaches, including Azure Pipelines, currently supports all 3 platforms. How does pricing compare to CircleCI? No understanding of GPU support on Azure. Looking to follow up for next week’s meeting. | . | OpenCue proposal . | Vote on adoption to incubation stage | We have quorum (exactly 50%) | DreamWorks and WETA were going to take a closer look at project. Dreamworks: scheduling is done on a per core basis, much more rigid than the way they currently schedule. They use percentages across shows rather than allocating cores to projects, which gives them high farm utilization, possibly higher than OpenCue approach. OpenCue takes a “every core is created equally”, they look at other aspects of the system. OpenCue couples the database to the scheduler, so if the DB goes down, scheduling would stop. Their approach relies less critically on the database. The OpenCue scheduler doesn’t expose a REST API, uses the Google Remote protocol instead, Dreamworks would prefer a REST API. In current state Dreamworks would probably not adopt OpenCue. Daniel: does Dreamworks see advantage to a common open source platform, could some of these features / approaches be put into a project like this? Bill: they probably wouldn’t contribute to this project as highest priority. | Brian: a lot of these feedback points are on the roadmap for future development, and they want to see more of this feedback from the community. | Kimball: some commonality in design with their in house system. Whether they would adopt it in the short term is orthogonal to the worth of the project being adopted in the ASWF. Good thing to have a project under active development, and they think it would be valuable to have it. | Eric: are there people / companies currently not contributing to this project who would contribute if it became an official project? What’s the practical difference being adopted vs not adopted? Kimbal: definitely some marketing exposure. Larry: reception on the long run would be better than a single studio / vendor project. Kimball: opportunity to see a new and vibrant project to grow within the community, model for new projects with larger / deeper scope. Brian: even if some of the TAC members aren’t contributing directly to code, having guidance from large studios would help to drive development. Todd: there’s an incubation period, so if we don’t see adoption, there’s a “way out” / other projects could take its place. Daniel: will add link to project lifecycle document. | Larry: if the model is that an incubating project may not graduate out of incubation, what happens to all of the material that got signed over to the foundation going into incubation (mailing lists on ASWF, project home on GitHub, signing over trademarks…). Is there a process for “spinning out” a project from incubation? | John: if a project is deemed that it should live elsewhere, ASWF can spin out assets to another entity, but not spelled out directly in lifecycle template, could use some clarification. If no one wants to pick up the project it could go into archive stage. Intent is that if a project enters incubation phase, it is expected that it will become a full fledged project. | David: first “new” project under consideration, we can rely on the templates provided by the Linux Foundation, but we can define our own process to address these questions, and the TAC is the correct body to make these decisions. It is important to add these questions at this point. The LF provided great templates based on previous work / experience, but we are free to adapt and change. | Daniel was given voting positions by some of the people who could not attend, but can’t present those if we are taking an in-person vote. So we should take this to an email vote. Daniel and John will set up a vote to take place ASAP after the meeting. | . | Vector / Matrix library . | Intense discussion for a while, but has tapered off. | Larry: summary is that we are trying to grope our way towards a minimal implementation that all projects could use for their public API, and perhaps for internal implementation, while leaving room for bit-accurate internal implementations. Luka was looking at whether they could share their internal designs (now that OpenEXR has applied). With EXR we have two separate projects with their separate implementations. But not much movement apart from mailing list discussion. Kimball: should it be part of IlmBase or a separate project. Larry: topic of split between IlmBase and OpenEXR proper has come up, application to ASWF gives forum to discuss this. No rush on this, and ASWF is good organization to tackle this. | Eric: has someone looked at GLM vector library? Larry: bigger than what he was thinking about. Larry: Eigen sometimes cited as something that projects explicitly don’t like to swallow as a dependency? We want to take advantage of new fp16 instructions on recent CPUs. | . | Update on candidate projects . | OpenEXR . | Proposal received 25-Mar-2019 | Can concentrate on voting next meeting once OpenCue is done | Should discuss on TAC mailing list | This will bring the 3 headline projects discussed during ASWF formation | We should start looking wider for other projects | . | Others? . | Kimball: CMake tools should probably not be a full project, still part of foundation. But raw2aces and photo developing project could still be a good candidate. | . | . | Next meeting | . ",

    "title": "Circle CI vs Jenkins",
    "content": ". | Decision rubric: discussions between Daniel and John Mertic on what the decision vectors should be: | . | Costs ( both hosting and support ) . | Capabilities ( OS support, GPUs ) . | User experience . | Encourage good / modern software development practices | . | Infrastructure reproducibility: costs, Internet access, seems to be less important than previously deemed, both opinion of Governing Board and TAC . | . | Update . | Activated CircleCI free for ASWF organization . | Cost estimates? . | On premises: Terraform does actually allow this via suitable providers aka resource APIs (including VMWare vSphere, OpenStack) . | Meetings have not happened yet with CircleCI for GPU cost estimates, Andrew still in touch with Thanh so has access to information on what he was working on. | There is the possibility of running multiple CI stacks in parallel, but more work needed on job design to make them CI agnostic. | Who owns the license of the current Windows build VM? Server 2016 license is owned by the cloud provider (VEXXhost), license cost included in VM running cost. | Daniel: given the flux of CI systems, it does seem like being as “CI agnostic” as possible is a desirable goal. Andrew: current stack is very Jenkins centric, but goal going forward is to decouple from Jenkins, moving Jenkins-centric parts into Ansible. | Daniel: we are also looking at package management for the software we build. | Daniel: how much value to the releng team is the work we are trying to do, given the different tool stack of ASWF projects (mostly C/C++/GPU) compared to other LF projects (mostly Java based). Andrew: there’s value to both trying to solve issues “holistically” as well as specifically. The releng team has visibility across all LF projects and can see commonality, so they can help with approaches that are viable for all projects. Sees ASWF as trailblazing in some areas and consuming what releng team has done for other areas. | Dan: perspective from OpenVDB. Currently working on transition to CMake, and how it integrates with CircleCI. Not all that difficult, went faster than expected. Haven’t really used CircleCI “in anger” yet, but seems a better alternative to Travis and faster (no preset 50m limit for builds). Also memory footprint is an issue, easy to bump into limits. Current plan is to merge CMake / Circle while keeping Travis for now, eventually switch completely to CircleCI. It’s also important to test the actual CMake configuration itself, for instance downloading OpenVDB source and installing dependencies, either from source or from package manager, would like to eliminate issues where the source doesn’t build on a specific platform because of dependencies. For instance OpenEXR namespacing vs not, which version you get when you apt-get. CI should capture all the ways in which developers may want to build the package while still documenting the “official” way to build the software. | Daniel: seems to lead to need for coherent handling of build, packaging and runtime environment? Aloys: consistent way to “find” packages in CMake would help a lot. Dan: agrees, looking at a versatile “find package” mechanism, handling of versioning namespace, clever but not “too clever”. We should come up with a standard set of what ASWF projects should support in that respect. Should not be done in isolation on a per project. | . | Azure Pipelines / DevOps (vs CircleCI from MS) . | Supports all 3 platforms: Windows, Linux, Mac . | GPU support: must be possible as Azure GPU VMs are available (specs and costs) . | JF: Trivial attempt at building IlmBase, Windows build images have GitBash installed so could probably use bash instead of PowerShell for Windows builds https://github.com/jfpanisset/openexr/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml . | Daniel: need to capture license tokens / licenses for commercial software, Azure has arrangement with Autodesk where you can get VMs that already have Autodesk licenses. | . | Google Cloud? . | Cloud Build Linux only . | GCP with Jenkins? . | No Mac VMs | . | . | Are we ready to give up full open source solution / reproducible stack? . | Governing Board indicated that they would be comfortable to forgo this in favour of more developer / project utility | . | Useful piece of Python code to manage encrypted credentials in Jenkins config.xml: https://github.com/tarvitz/jenkins-utils . | Need to have some realistic cost estimates to make a decision, will need Governing Board decision once there are hard costs involved. Hopefully should be able to present a decision for next Governing Board meeting a month from now. | Aloys: would greatly help if the Maya DevKit could be repackaged as a Conan or Res package. Gordon: red flag is “avoid anything that sidesteps the EULA”. | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 1 . | Result of OpenCue adoption vote . | John: OpenCue has fully passed, we got all the votes. | . | Proposed updates to project lifecycle . | A few dissenting votes on OpenCue seemed to be related to lifecycle of OpenCue project compared to other projects so far. Should we discuss the concept of the “incubation stage”: that’s where a project goes to ‘get its stuff together’, for other projects it’s been the administrative steps of code repo transfers, licensing, contribution agreements. For OpenCue there’s the added dimension of it being a “new” technology (at least as an open source project). Should there be additions to the project lifecycle document that address these issues. Larry: does the current document speak of a “time limit” for the incubation phase, or should it be driven by the project itself? Or it is the responsibility of the TAC to make determination of end of incubation phase. The documentation speaks of an Annual Review for this case. Should this be updated / clarified? Similarly there is some documentation that speaks of the Graduation Review which doesn’t have specific language about adoption. | Timeframes for phases? | Henry: . | specific project criteria for graduation | Resource commitments and roadmap to address above? | . | Larry: exit path from incubation | John: asking Bill about his concern with | Kimball: we should have a discussion about resource prioritization between projects. | Daniel: will suggest some additions to the lifecycle document on TAC mailing list, as well as re-emphasize the existence of that document. | . | OpenEXR Adoption . | Proposal | Presented by Jonathan Stone, Lucasfilm advanced development group, lead on Material X, has been taking lead on several Open Source projects at Lucas Film | Created in 1999 at ILM, open sourced in 2003, received an Academy Sci-Tech Award in 2007. | Believes the incubation stage requirements are already met. | Adopted stage requirements: . | 39 committers on GitHub, individuals and companies | No CII badge yet | 1279 commits over GitHub lifetime | No documentation of list of committers | No technical lead appointed | No license scan submitted to TAC | . | Near term goals: . | CMake-based build / test infrastructure on near-term roadmap | 23 open pull requests to be merged | Need a way to report security issues | Should IlmBase be a separate Git module? | Discussion on lightweight, shared library for vector/matrix functionality | . | SIGGRAPH 2018 BOF feedback . | Simple and fast write path (along the lines of TinyEXR) | Integer image support (reducing the need for TIFF) | Standalone LibHalf library (and reconciliation with CUDA half type) | GPU decompression for performance (possibly supporting only a subset of formats) | Metadata standardization | . | Proposed list of initial Technical Steering Committee, also looking to give write access for recognized committers | Jim: does the current decompression use SIMD / parallelism / AVX512? Kimbal: fully multi-threaded, some snippets of SIMD code, but goal is to be portable, then be fast. So majority of the code is “generic CPU but multi-threaded”. Jim: may be an opportunity to pursue “GPU + SIMD” decompression. Larry: currently multi-threading is only in case where application is reading multiple scanlines at once. Part of the point of GPU decompression is when the end destination of the image is the GPU anyway. Usage patterns make it not attractive to use GPU decompression if you have to read the image back right away. | Daniel: project should move from current CLA to Linux Foundation minimal CLA. License for project is a modified 3-clause BSD. John: there are also some CLAs in the TAC repo. Jonathan: looking at adopting stock Linux Foundation CLA. | Vote on adoption to incubation stage. Daniel calling for the vote: Bill seconding. Project is approved unanimously. | Cary Philips: TAC should be involved in discussing the future of LibHalf / iMath since several facilities have a lot of code based on those libraries, so changes should not be undertaken lightly. Daniel: ASWF is the right place to discuss these impacts. Cary: iMath could be a separate project outside EXR, that’s not really a problem, but changing the API would. Daniel: every project ends up folding in its own math library… Justifiable but creates issues at scale. | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Dan Bailey: still looking at CI and CMake as main 2 projects on the roadmap, lots of progress being made. Should be able to migrate to CircleCI in next 2 weeks. | Received proposal from Autodesk for multi-resolution grid storage, will be discussing in next meeting, whether good fit with OpenVDB. | . | OpenColorIO . | Mike Dolan: put out a 1.1.1 release last week, first release in over a year, mostly bugfix / patch release. | Working on CII badge requirements, main focus of recent discussion. Some aspects were deferred on wider TAC-wide decisions, in particular security considerations and minimal static analysis requirements. Don’t want to go too far down the road if the wider community will decide to go in different direction. Daniel: lines up with OpenVDB situation, OpenCue will bring very different requirements. | Working on license scan issues, having discussions with ACES project over the ACES config that is widely used in OCIO repository and has license differences. | Approached by Marvel, interested in contributing to OCIO in near future. | . | . | CI updates . | Circle CI . | Andrew: no progress on discussions with CircleCI folks, meeting still hasn’t happened. Still trying to resolve that issue. From perspective of CI systems, RelEng evaluating Circle CI and Azure Pipelines from wider perspective of several projects under LF. | Internal discussion on Gitlab CI as a potential option (you can use GitLab CI against GitLab or GitHub). GitLab CI runner service supports all 3 major platforms. | . | Working group: see notes from last meeting | Jim: pointing out the Professional CMake book, which is a good, prescriptive book on how to use CMake. | . | John: CommunityBridge introduction . | May have been brought up on previous TAC call / email thread | Platform debued by Linux Foundation to help sustainability of Open Source projects, for instance mentorship programs. | Would TAC be interested in a presentation by someone from the CommunityBridge project? Daniel: yes, we would be interested. | John will make connection between team and Daniel, will be presenting at a future TAC meeting. | . | Update on industry / candidate projects . | DWA: USD Manager and others. Lightweight USD browser. About to contribute Nuke plugin that read / writes USD. Larry: what were considerations of making this a separate project instead of contributing back to USD project itself? Based on feedback from USD group. Gordon: probably same with USD Maya plugin. Larry: thinking about USD as a single, integrated “package” vs multiple independent projects. Message from USD team at SIGGRAPH 2018 was that plugins would move to external repositories. Jim: released USD Hydra / OSPray render as a separate plugin. | Data projects (e.g. wikihuman, datasets like Moana Island) . | Mostly static datasets | Different license requirements | Is there value for the ASWF in hosting those? | JF: could be used for testing infrastructure of existing projects | Gordon: job of hosting data could be quite different than hosting software / code. Should we focus on software / code for now? Those discussions came up earlier. Daniel: trying to get a sense as to whether there’s been a shift of opinion. Jim: they do load the Moana dataset every day, so it’s been hugely useful for them, but also understand that it is a different undertaking to host these datasets. | . | Vector / Matrix library | Camera raw library | others? | . | Next meeting . | April 24, 2019 | . | .

Good amount of free minutes for open source projects, CircleCI would have more limitations on concurrent jobs. | Gordon: what are the licensing implications on third party hosted CI environments. Andrew: LF has no expertise so far with commercial software, but has another project which is running into similar issues (Zoe for OpenMainframe project). Gordon: needs to make sure that donated licenses are used only for ASWF CI purposes. | Andrew: looking at using HashiCorp Vault for CI-platform agnostic storage of secrets / credentials. Just the beginnings of a plan. | Daniel: asking of Andrew what the specific requirements are. Gordon: trying to consult with internal resources as to what their legal requirements are. What about a company using the CI system for its own projects? . | Daniel: we need to consider incorporation of commercially licensed packages as a primary factor of how we design our CI jobs. We don’t yet have a prototype of all those pieces working together. | GitLab CI? LF releng may suggest that for very low cost projects, get a bit better platform for CircleCI, they have a documented roadmap. Does offer the option of self hosting. Can execute their runner service on pretty much any system, which can then be incorporated into their build cloud. | Jeff: what is the progress on CMake Tools? That’s what Dreamworks has been waiting to ingest projects? Daniel: no hard progress yet, but now that OpenEXR is a project, transition to CMake in that project should provide real deliverables. | Andrew: just created ASWF organization in Azure Pipelines . | . | .

    "content": ". | SonarCloud is free to OSS projects operating with a repository presence on GitHub . | The AcademySoftwareFoundation org has been created on SonarCloud ( https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/academysoftwarefoundation ) . | Analysis with SonarCloud happens as a CI job (just as with SonarQube) so jobs will need to be written to handle this. There are a few methodologies for using Sonar that projects LF supports have used. The most common is to just have weekly scans against the HEAD of master and not to scan on every change. This takes care of most scanning needs. | Andrew: did some work on SonarCloud, while it is free for GitHub users, you can hook it up to any CI system, so LF releng is looking at retiring SonarQube support and transition projects to SonarCloud. | Typically projects running Sonar once a week against master branch. One of their projects is looking at gating PRs through Sonar, which puts a lot of overhead on merging contributions, but makes sure you run against smaller datasets (can take a long time to run). | SonarCloud web interface seems to have all the functionality of SonarQube, as well as access to all the plugins. | Dan: OpenVDB is still working on CMake / CI work, so not quite ready to look at code coverage yet, looking at merging CircleCI / AppVeyor configs. Good amount of progress made recently. | Daniel: subtleties related to ownership / permissions can make it tricky to integrate external services. Is it possible to generate a branch that adds SonarCloud scanning? Andrew: SonarCloud needs keys in the job, not sure how that would work with CircleCI yet. SonarCloud has documentation for how to do it in Travis CI (which already has integration), but will need to figure out how to do this in CircleCI. Could be done against a specific branch, can run into issues with how SonarCloud deals with branches, “namespace pollution” in Sonar. Which is why it tends to be simpler to do Sonar analysis against the master branch. Dan: need a dedicated branch for testing purposes during the integration phase. Andrew: one approach would be to ignore the “namespace pollution”, do the integration work in a branch, and when ready to merge into master just “start from scratch”. | Daniel: we see a value in the well presented results presented by Sonar, but our first step will be clang-tidy, but clearly value in both. | .

Good amount of progress made recently. | Driving CircleCI / AppVeyor from CMake rather than Make. Andrew: have to be on a paid plan to have access to macOS builds with CircleCI (maybe?). Have Linux and Windows builds. | Dan: took a look at Azure Pipelines, seems to cover all platforms and has flexible time limits. | How to build jobs is moved into bash scripts rather than CI config files, so transitioning between services is easier (except for AppVeyor which is more Windows specific). | Andrew: have you looked at Ansible? Dan: building all dependencies at build time, which gives a lot of control, and build time is not prohibitive. Trying to draw a line between “VFX dependencies” and “third party / generic dependencies”, so could make sense to use Ansible / Docker for “generic” dependencies. Also looked at setting up latest / top of tree build of dependencies (boost, tbb…) to watch out for any upcoming issues. Could run once a week to keep an eye on what may be coming down the pipe from these third party dependencies. But don’t want to disrupt pull requests to OpenVDB due to recent changes to these dependencies. Also when building Houdini plugins they build against latest production build, so that can also result in build issues if there are API changes, don’t want pull requests affected by those changes either. | Currently 4 different CIs running, need to lower that to avoid extra work. | Once CMake is fully worked out and supported, should provide a strong foundation for further progress. | Daniel: have you been finding a natural place for Cmake-related “components” for better cross-project support? Dan: using pretty standard CMake approach with “findmodules”, strategy of supporting current and 2 older versions of VFX Reference Platform. Backported some newer CMake packages into older versions to support older builds. Boost is tricky since you need the latest version of CMake for the latest version of Boost. There are some pieces that could be turned into standard components, but don’t want to add an extra dependency. | Daniel: is there a specific PR to look at in OpenVDB to look at? Dan: yes, but need another week or two, would prefer to point to master branch. | Dan: want to introduce a CMake linter to OpenVDB project. OpenVDB builds shared and static libraries, CMake 3.12 helps with those kinds of issues. | . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: no CI-specific updates. | Exploring SonarCloud integration, really interested for CII badge requirements, will be looking at connecting to it in the coming weeks. Andrew: there’s a token required to make sure the results appear in the right place and a API key. Andrew can generate keys for personal testing (which is where HashiCorp Vault could be useful). How to connect to Travis CI: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/sonarcloud/ Michael: can prototype in current Travis builds. | . | OpenEXR . | Jonathan: excited to move forward with CI solutions for OpenEXR. Prerequisite is a robust CMake infrastructure which builds without warnings on all platforms. | Haven’t had first TSC meeting yet, where the priorities will be discussed. | Daniel: will need to tackle the discussion of whether OpenEXR should split off some sub components. Jonathan: separate of IlmBase seems the most natural, further separation of components remains to be discussed. | Lots of experience with Travis and AppVeyor at ILM, but open to other solutions. Would like to treat Windows and Mac as first class citizens so have preference for solution that covers all 3 platforms. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: OpenCue will have different build and test requirements, mixture of Java and Python, multi-component system. | Had to rebuild testing infrastructure from ground up to separate from SPI internal infrastructure. | Have unit tests, no integration tests yet, more of a manual QA process, needs to be improved. | Jenkins instance connected to GitHub repo, using Jenkins Pipelines. | Not highly dependent on Jenkins, lightweight wrapper around Docker-based build system. | GitHub integration running for master, will test branch and merge result for PRs. | Highest priority is to finish expanding unit tests, and integration test. | Andrew: can use the ASWF Jenkins instance, should be easy to move build jobs there if that helps. | Daniel: what is needed to support OpenCue in a similar way to the other projects? There are probably technologies that OpenCue would benefit from for integration testing? Brian: need to do some research. | Daniel: are there other LF projects that could have relevant expertise? ONAP does orchestration between Docker containers, have some good examples for VM to VM in OpenDaylight including custom network buildout. They have various examples of how to do multi container testing. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 1 . | Progress on CI goals | Can we find useful projects to bring in to meet our 6 project goal. We need to accelerate the process on this. Does this cause dilution of effort? | JF: should different problems be tasked with trying to solve different aspects of what needs to be done to become a full fledged ASWF project. | Larry: rate of acceptance can be problematic when all projects are in the same phase. The “steady state” of accepting new projects will be less taxing. | Daniel: adding new projects adds resources and are a net gain rather than a dilution of resources. | Gordon: how could we demonstrate the benefit of the foundation by demonstrating what we’ve done with the existing projects rather than concentrating on getting additional projects (was goal of 6 projects somewhat arbitrary?). When ASWF was set up, wanted to solve the cross platform issues for one thing, are we happy with where we’ve gotten so far? | Eric: should ask individual project leads “what has the ASWF made easier”? “What are the next 2 things you expect from ASWF?” | Gordon: could do this as a SurveyMonkey of the ASWF project leads, and also for the ASWF members. That should give us a good idea of where to focus our energies. | Larry: SPI has other projects it can submit, haven’t been in a hurry to do this, given that the projects already in the queue are consuming a lot of bandwidth (CII badge, CI system, security…). Amount of work required to push the next project in will be a lot lower once the existing projects have solved those issues. Feels that this may be a thought in the heads of other people managing projects that could be potential candidates. | Daniel: consensus seems to be we should “clear the pipe” first, agrees with Gordon’s suggestion to consult with projects / members. | Larry: once OCIO gets all these requirements worked out, we will have a good story to tell, will be able to show all the benefits that OCIO got out of being part of the organization. | Cary: ultimate is to the users of the project, so a year from now hopefully people out in the community should be able to say “OpenEXR is so much easier to use” (for instance). Benefits to the maintainers is secondary benefit / means to an end. | Daniel: does this stretch to “easily instalable builds on every platform” for instance? Cary: yes, but also release cadence, number of outstanding pull requests, “this library is of greater value to the community than if the foundation had come along”. | Eric: coordination is also a good thing, picking standard components (linear algebra libraries for instance). Does adoption increase because of ASWF membership, giving confidence in longevity. | . | Governing Board meeting update . | Meeting yesterday | Discussion was mostly recap of process of accepting OpenCue and OpenEXR as incubation projects | Reviewed discussions of incubation stage vs graduation, what that means for the other projects in Foundation at this stage (see PR update) | Interesting news for upcoming events (SIGGRAPH) | . | Lifecycle doc updates . | PR | Need to support well established projects as well as new/upcoming projects | “Be deemed by the TAC to add potential or value to the mission of ASWF. “ : any suggestions for alternative wording to “add potential”? | We want to send a clear message in answer to questions about any projects outside of the “obvious candidates” | Doug: comment on “Graduation Review”. Should CII Badge requirement be part of that discussion? | Daniel: trying to restart efforts for security analysis | PR should be a prompt for discussion, not final result. | Need language about potential exit of project, “no fault / no damage” exit process. Not easy to specify in detail (discussion prompted by Larry). | . | LF CommunityBridge Intro . | Video | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Daniel: more work to establish CircleCI as alternative CI system to previous Travis / AppVeyor, doesn’t necessarily preclude future shift to Azure or other system. | Work to bring up other best practices such as updates to project copyright header, spdx headers | Large potential contribution from Autodesk for large, multi-resolution grid system, interesting but challenging contribution | . | OpenColorIO . | Starting to investigate SonarCloud integration (temporarily using SPI account) | Working towards CII badge: setting up vulnerability report project security@opencolorio.org which forwards to private OCIO TSC mailing list | Will have additional point releases prior to next VFX reference platform, which currently says 1.1.x | CLA system is up and running. Larry starting to investigate, moving towards repo transfer to ASWF | Sean Cooper will be representing OCIO on ACES TAC to connect both projects (since they are tightly coupled) | Daniel: have details of license scan been cleared up? Mike: not yet. Some external dependencies need to be cleared up, may need to revisit timeline / allocate more resources. Larry: mostly a function of developer bandwidth? Mike: yes. | Daniel: great to see practical steps being made on security requirements. | JF: does it make sense to extend security reporting infrastructure to every project, make it “the way to report security issues for ASWF project”? | Mike: investigated several projects that have CI badge (for instance Blender), many don’t support private reporting. Agrees it would make sense to have a standard approach. | Daniel: would make sense to create a pattern, test it, and if we like it extend it across multiple projects. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: not too much done yet, final approval went through not long ago | Next steps are to officially start the TSC and schedule meetings. Is there an “official process” for that? Daniel: this is covered in technical charter, John can provide help / guidance. | Jenkins migration is furthest along, looks promising so far, should be straightforward. | Should have more to discuss at next meeting. | . | OpenEXR . | Carey Philipps to be representative for now | Sent online poll to steering committee | . | . | CI updates . | CI platform comparison . | Andy: discussion around OpenCue using current LF Jenkins platform, sent info to Brian, info was useful. | SonarCloud: had discussion with Michael Dolan about OpenColorIO, we haven’t transferred ownership of the repo yet (still under SPI), so we can connect it to ASWF SonarCloud org. Will be working out documentation. | ASWF Azure Pipelines org created, need to pay for GPU. Can you invite individual contributors to the organization? For now need to use Microsoft accounts. | Will probably need some kind of sandbox setup to allow projects to experiment with the CI system | Was an issue in Jenkins system before a sandbox was added (sandbox gets “purged” every week) | Daniel: hoping for a mostly DevOps like setup, rather than a lot of configuration that lives inside the CI system. Should be able to use a PR-style approach to managing CI configuration. | Andrew: Linux Foundation is likely to be in charge that a repo is properly connected to a CI system. | . | CII badge . | Static analysis | Security . | John Mertic reaching out to CII badge program leaders to get more info | Daniel: reaching out to people who offered to help with security issues | . | . | . | Candidate projects . | SIGGRAPH . | Emily Olin: director of communications at LF | https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N_dB78EFZRdEi2qKWJEykaPP-swTqZFFwtzLcV5wxIw/edit?usp=sharing | Face to Face TAC meeting | Project BoFs and TSC meetings | First day is Digipro, submissions due May 3, some kind of sponsorship level contemplated | Sunday Pipeline conference, 100/200 people in Downtown LA, looking for speakers. | Also sponsoring SIGGRAPH Diversity and Inclusion summit | 3:30 to 4:30 Monday ASWF Overview BoF | 6:00 to 8:00 Beers of a Feather at Prank Bar | Tuesday: Trying to organize a Open Source Track for BoFs | Including projects outside of ASWF | Wednesday: Board Meeting, perhaps in person TAC meeting | Looking at inviting leaders of outside projects | Slots for individual ASWF projects | Kimball: are these replacing the traditional BoFs? Yes, working with SIGGRAPH organizers to bring together the open source BoFs. Trying to make it easier, avoid having to run back and forth between locations. | May become an “official” Open Source track in 2020. | Doug: Tuesday sessions would be outward facing updates to the outside work, Wednesday sessions would be for internal project issues? Emily: yes, Wednesday sessions are for smaller group, projects can decide what they want to do with those sessions. | Doug: last year OpenColorIO working session was 2hrs, so 1hr may not be sufficient, may need to schedule another hour somewhere else? Emily: lunch hour may be available. | Emily: please share any other talks related to ASWF so they can be coordinated and/or promoted | Emily: also looking for presenters at other technical conferences. | Daniel: next step to provide feedback to Emily about schedule, and confirmations from each project. | Daniel: Emily can help to publicize project releases | . | Next meeting: 8 May 2019 | .

At least one project graduation. | Expectations | Filters for analysis / scan shared across projects | Accelerate project graduation | . | July: Dependency management. | In context of our CI system first | Broader community scope | . | . | . | CII Best Practices Badge discussion (David Wheeler) . | Analysis requirements, how to interpret fairly open ended requirements and how to address them | Many tools used by other LF projects not applicable to our C++ projects | Key requirement is project must use a static analysis tool: cppcheck for instance. There are suggestions to use tools that specifically check for security issues (not required). | Dynamic tool requirement is a suggestion, it is encouraged but is not a requirement. | https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/criteria.md | Security: no requirement that there is a “security expert” on each project, but list specific knowledge that someone must have . | Know-secure design | Knowing common errors . | E.g. CWE top 25 | . | . | Most tools provide some kind of guidance document about what should be turned on and off, apply common sense to avoid “busy work” | Use comment strings in code to disable specific scanner warnings | No specific requirements on the testing | Main idea is to have “something you can improve on”, start with weak rules, improve over time. | No specific requirements for testing, except: . | You must have automated testing in place | You must add new tests to cover new functionality | . | Different between green field and brown field, existing projects will typically have huge amounts of warnings | OpenColorIO . | Analysis and security are areas where they have yet to make much headway | How to deal with legacy code that has less test coverage vs new code that has good coverage: is it mandatory to go back to improve coverage of old code? David: there are 3 badge levels, “Passing / Silver / Gold”, focussing more on getting projects to “Passing” first. No strict coverage requirements for “Passing” level, there’s a “suggested” requirement for dynamic analysis. Vary the inputs / 80% coverage. For “Silver” you require 80% test coverage, of course possible to have high coverage yet a lousy test suite. Mike: OCIO has a “legacy” branch in current use, and mostly new code for the new version, so probably won’t go back and invest a lot of time in adding coverage to that old branch. David: focus at the project level, but expected that the idea is mostly “going forward”. So 80% coverage would be for the active development branch. Mike: future branch for release in 1 year or so. David: most of their projects release at a faster pace, so could target “passing” for now, “silver” for next major release. | . | . | CI updates . | (Andrew) Updates from LF . | Azure pipelines still most promising candidate (3 platform, GPU support and cost) | . | Working group | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | Andrew: stale branch cleanup. | . | OpenColorIO . | Azure test project . | Michael: Setup for Linux builds. “Task” structure seems to work well.

Goal is to set cross platform build as much as possible, with test matrix that supports all platforms. | Daniel: does it look difficult to get the RHEL Developer Tool Set into the build environments? (for VFX Platform compliant builds). Michael: there is Docker support, but possibly only for Linux.

Was reasonably straightforward. Needs a somewhat compatible Docker image, but fewer restrictions than CircleCI docker images. Have to make sure you don’t write outside your Docker user.

At least one project graduation. | July: Dependency management. | . | . | LF CommunityBridge Intro (Bryan Stone, Shubhra Kar) (0:05-0:20) . | Video | Focus on funding diversity, security . | Putting money in the hands of maintainers, user groups, meetups, causes that use open source technology | Be an intermediary to allow transparent access to funds | Sample Project: Chaos Group, how would they like to spend the funds, mentorship opportunities, smaller portion towards marketing | There are some fees associated with running the platform, but fees get credited back under $10m | Do vulnerability scanning | Mentorships, companies can sponsor mentors, paid internships | Key contributors can guide new contributors | Showcase individual contributors | Companies can provide direct funds as well as positions | Basically matchmaking | Static code analysis, integrating existing service offerings | Daniel: ASWF is looking for mechanism to find contributors / matchmaking. Taken early steps through GitHub “First Issues” mechanism. | Interest from our members in mentoring | Looking for ways to share and grow our security expertise (we are somewhat of an outlier from other projects due to primarily C++ nature of our projects) | Mike, Larry: specific resources for OpenColorIO. 2 types of resources we are looking for: people just getting into Open Source, also ASWF members who are looking to do more significant contributions. | Bryan: no barrier to entry, no downside to adding project to CommunityBridge. Just go to communitybridge.org to submit the project. Basic information: repo location, logo, project description. Also what is the project looking for, also valid for non-technical contributions (project management, documentation…). Covers both paid internships and voluntary contributions. | Larry: needs will vary a lot between ASWF projects (and potential ASWF projects). Some projects have wide appeal, some are very niche with very narrow technical focus. No clear if “soliciting help from the world” is going to really help or just “generate noise”. So may be best to concentrate on people working at companies already part of ASWF / in the industry. | Bryan: can be used as just a landing page that you can point people to, can post link to that page on relevant forums. Larry: are there tools to filter projects on CommunityBridge based on interest / relevance? Bryan: currently no good tools for filtering / grouping but on the roadmap. | Daniel: as we develop auxiliary projects (CI-related, CMake), we need a better documentation infrastructure. | Bryan: some organizations have created a single “project” for the entire organization, others break it up into individual projects and seek specific skill sets for these individual projects. | Daniel will create ASWF page on CommunityBridge | . | . | CI updates (0:20-0:30) . | Last meeting in May, need decisions made before Board meeting next week | Platform decision (May) | Azure Pipelines testing . | Andrew: GPU access, increase parallel processing in Azure. No group discount rates currently, at moment more processing time would require paying market rate for those resources. Haven’t found exactly what those costs would be. | No agent pools available with GPUs, we would spin up a “container group”, install Azure Agent. | Azure: GPU on Linux only | Since we can run our own agent pool out of other clouds, we should be able to run GPU systems on other public cloud providers if needed. | Could use MacStadium for Macs | Best approach is to do everything inside containers | Trying to get better information on pricing | Already have a LF organization on Docker Hub, could get ASWF specific org | Are we looking at testing on multiple GPU or driver versions? On Azure we only have access to a very specific GPU. Daniel: early on we would be happy with “any GPU”. There’s a good opportunity for us to use the CI to build the matrix of GPUs / drivers. | Larry: for now OpenColorIO just needs to be able to run “modern OpenGL”. Mac also needs OpenGL, but may have to switch to Metal. | Andrew: all Azure GPUs are Tesla. Larry: some projects (current or future) will want to run CUDA code. | Existing LF/ASWF CI infrastructure does have access to GPU on Linux/Windows on OpenStack public cloud provider | Will use containers to get RHEL/CentOS environment on the Ubuntu agent pool | Need to experiment, how to interact with component repositories for simpler experimentation | Jenkins system already has Docker workflows. | Could use existing Jenkins docker staging system with other CI systems | . | Container approach helps to not be strongly tied to any one CI solution. | . | . | Technical Project updates (0:30-0:50) . | OpenVDB . | Dan: 6.1 released recently, complete overhaul of CMake build system, much more modern now. Deprecating a lot of older functionality, with a more formal mechanism for deprecating older functionality. | Migration to CircleCI, in tandem with CMake overhaul. Aloys created prototype of how this would work on Azure. | CI supports WIndows and Linux, no Mac or Maya builds. | Cleaning up warnings. | Dealing with flow of issues reported by users on different platforms, newer compilers. Want to build wider range of configurations to catch those issues. | Looking at VFX Reference Platform CY2020. | CII badge hold ups: . | User feedback mechanism | Static analysis (will come after move to Azure) | Security and vulnerability | . | Looking at likely 6.2 release around SIGGRAPH time with some big new features. | . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: still working on Azure pipeline setup, not a ton of progress. Looking at using Docker images. | Actively working on correcting embedded external dependencies. Script to download dependencies into a directory in the build location which CMake can build and patch as needed. Want to make building OCIO as simple as possible while adhering to ASWF licensing requirements. | New feature from Autodesk merged last week: support for dynamic parameters in processors, can use GPU renderer with uniforms. Currently supports only display transformations but plan to expand. | Issues with Azure? Michael: there’s a ASWF Docker Hub account, can OCIO still use the ASWF Docker Hub before the repo has been moved to ASWF GitHub? Andrew: yes, but he would need admin privileges / keys to the ASWF Docker Hub repo (required to push images to Docker Hub). All access tokens had to be revoked 2 weeks ago due to security breach. | No authentication tokens needed to pull Docker images from Azure. | Larry: we should have a set of pre-built Docker images based on VFX Reference Platform years. Andrew: we probably need a repo for the Docker container configurations. Also build recipes for external components used by our projects. | . | OpenEXR . | Larry: TSC on hiatus due to vacations, but pick up in 2 weeks. Should have been activity by next TAC meeting. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: making progress on the transfers to ASWF. TSC now has 5 members with a good variety of people. | Finalizing repository migration. | Figuring out how CLAs are going to work | About ready to migrate to the ASWF mailing lists | Started on CII badge process (see TAC readme) | New TSC members joined a week ago so still ramping up. | Should be able to pull together initial roadmap and priority list soon. | Daniel: does OpenCue want to draw on experiences of other projects? Brian: work is required on how the internal scheduling algorithm works, so would be good to get input on that. | . | . | VFX Reference Platform 2020 Draft (0:50-0:55) . | Details | VFX Platform 2020: main thing is Python 3. Larry asked about compiler versions. Daniel: AL feels we should move forward with compiler versions fairly aggressively. | Extension of platform to other operating systems: which version, which compiler? | Kimball: 10% performance boost from switching to LLVM8 using gcc headers, seems to generate better code. Larry: SPI builds with CLangs with old gcc headers for compatibility. Should VFX Platform tackle this, or should this be a recommended practice from ASWF. We should give people a bit more guidance / leaway, wasteful for everyone to have to figure this out separately. | Daniel: use of the RedHat Developer Toolset (DTS) compiler with peculiar approach of allowing newer C++ extensions while still being able to link to older system libraries gets complicated / fragile. Decoupling compiler version requirement vs binary compatibility would be useful for everything. Right now they build most things with DTS, but more modern compilers for in-house, performance critical projects. | Jeff: also run into problems mixing compilers, they prefer safe approach of sticking with recommended compiler. | . | Next meeting . | 5 June 2019 | Daniel on leave for next 3 weeks, will hand over chair duties to someone | . | .

    "content": ". | LF Rel Eng Update (Andrew) . | Responded to a couple of email threads . | Azure / Docker: acquired academysoftwarefoundation registry on Docker Hub, tried to acquire aswf-staging but already used? Aloys got it, but can cede it to LF releng (not typo squatting!) | Should we create a ASWF Docker repo in GitHub? Andrew suggests putting templates in ci-management repository, can keep in a central location, and keeps side by side with Jenkins / Packer work. | Waiting for the azure-pipelines.yaml merge in OpenVDB repo before can link repo to Azure Pipelines. Dan: ran into similar issues with CircleCI. Will do work on his side first. | Higher end builders: we need to provide our own builders, which incurs costs, we would have to manage instances. Dan: can we just increase the existing resources? Andrew: hasn’t found a way to do this yet. | Daniel: should we try to approach Azure Pipelines tech support? Andrew: trying to figure out who to talk to at Microsoft. Someone else at LF has been in contact, waiting for introduction. Daniel: tried to go through Azure support, but that didn’t help. | Conan / Conda plugins for Nexus3: no binary distribution available, you have to compile / install yourself, makes it more difficult to work with configuration management. Can you present the same files via multiple plugins? Not in Nexus 3. Also disk space on Nexus 3 system can be grown dynamically. Daniel: what would be the process for managing disk space / costs? Nexus 3 offers proxy, host and meta repositories. Normally LF sets up a cleanup on proxy repository, no cleanup on release hosted repos, but cleanup on dev hosted repo (maintain snapshot releases up to 30 days by default). Not immediately clear how that would work with Conan / Conda. | Nexus 3 uses a blob store on the backend, so can be challenging to figure out where disk space is being used. Can do compacting to reclaim disk space. | All LF systems managed as “pets” have alerting configured, they know when a system is running low on space. | Daniel: what advantages to using our own Nexus3 repo as opposed to other systems? Andrew: main advantage is policies we set, a third party solution (e.g. Artifactory Cloud) is more at the mercy of the policies set by the provider. On LF Nexus3 systems a dedicated user account is created per project, which avoid artifacts from one project overwriting ones from another project. | JFrog Artifactory backed by Google Cloud (free for OSS) | LF has no projects currently using Artifactory, but they have a project coming online which has that as a requirement, so Artifactory will be supported. | GitHub has beta repository support, Azure Pipelines as well, supports a certain set of repo formats. | LF shifting to only using Docker Hub as container registry. | Daniel: looks like we’re still in exploratory stage with respect to artifact repositories. Especially once we look at workflows that involve branches and PRs. | Aloys: is the ci-management repo linked to Azure Pipelines? Andrew: not yet, for now just linked to Jenkins, but could be. | Dan: in setting Azure for OpenVDB they used native Docker Hub build system, seemed quite straightforward. When you push a commit it will build images automatically. Andrew: not a problem, Docker Hub will only re-trigger the required builds. | . | . | OpenColorIO on Azure Pipelines (Michael) . | Had some cycles to spend on Azure setup for OpenColorIO, not in main branch yet (in ci_test branch) | Builds functional on all 3 platforms, SonarCloud working as well | Seems to be working well, all builds in a single platform | Linux uses Docker images, since line of configuration, Mac uses Brew, Windows will use Docker, but for now native | Took advantage of Azure template functionality to set up YAML templates you can call from multiple jobs with parameters, so primary Azure YAML file is quite simple | Andrew: seems similar to global-jjb for Jenkins, can you reference these templates from other repositories? Michael: seems to be, for now they live in another repository. Did encounter some weirdness with variable expansion to be able to do conditional routing of builds. But sometimes variable don’t seem to expand when expected. Can also build expressions into steps to do conditional execution. | Static analysis is working and providing lots of information, running from test brach but analysing master branch. | Daniel: should we try to converge to central location for Docker configurations? Michael: yes, would be useful. For instance, built a Docker image for Linux builds, try to follow VFX Reference Platform as much as possible, but would be nice to have standard VFX Reference Platform images per year and layer on top of those. Within a centralized Docker hub, could have locations for project-specific configurations. Currently just reading images, not requirement to push back Docker images. | Daniel: seems good alignment in work between Dan, Aloys and Michael. We seem to be in a middle ground to capture external dependencies in an external system (Conda, Conan) vs Docker layers. Where we store Docker images / configurations is not a gating factor. | Need to be able to override separation to avoid dependencies between project repos and ci-management repo with different permissions. Dan: should we have a based master repo that can be forked by individual projects? It could get complicated to change master configs once we have multiple projects. A base image that has everything the VFX Reference Platform would be nice, but in reality there may need to be adaptations for different projects. | Aloys: GPU-enabled docker images also require specific configuration, so no longer possible to inherit from a single base image. Can use Ansible recipes to manage Docker base images. | Jeff: a single source without too much variation will help us to get all our components working together, since that’s where they will eventually run in a facility. May be a good idea to limit flexibility in this case. | Daniel: simplicity is a goal, we already have the opportunity to explore things independently using the current tools / methods. Need to define a nice way to have a shared resource for Dockerfiles and Docker images while still being able to experiment on a per-project basis. We should set up a test repo to try the shared approach so we can experiment. | Aloys: Michael mentioned wanting to use Docker on Windows. Why not use the base image from Azure? Michael: OpenColorIO was OK with the base image, hosted Azure agents have multiple Python versions, so can be tricky to grab the correct version. Docker offers a more streamlined way to set up the environment, more flexible to try new things, also to contain special case installs, not as simple to setup using tasks. Autodesk developers work on Windows natively, could use their environment tools. Aloys: Microsoft promised they wouldn’t release Docker images with Visual Studio pre-installed (would be too large). So a Docker image with the compiler might be tricky. Was able to build NumPy without Docker. Where could you host a Windows Docker image with Visual Studio pre-installed? Andrew: could be legal issues with that. Michael: used the Use Python Azure task (no access to Python dynamic libraries). But Docker can isolate from errant environment variables. | Aloys: Could we use the LF Foundation images from Azure? Andrew: we could have some static resources in existing cloud, but that would incur cost, and hasn’t been done before. There was no formalized budget on the CI resource use on VEXXhost, we don’t have any official budget for that. VEXXhost has just dropped prices, also changed hourly to per-minute billing. No easy way in Azure Pipelines to spin up builders dynamically. Daniel: also a blocker for GPU builds / testing. | Andrew: what’s the default licensing? Apache V2, we now have a aswf-docker repo. Aloys: we need to revisit the issue of Houdini / Autodesk SDK installations in Docker images, probably should do it on the flight during the build. Dan: we can also make the repositories private as an option. Azure Pipelines has 60 min limit if all is public, so would it be an issue if a Docker image was private? | . | Artifact, Package, Container storage and process . | ASWF docker hub and repo | Conan / Conda plugins for ASWF Nexus? . | Aloys: could LF RelEng create an official Artifactory account? Somewhat less straightforward since you have to put in a request for an official open source project. Would open up some additional possibilities. | . | . | . ",

Docker based on what Dan did for OpenVDB. Will share the results of the discussion on email thread to TAC list. Azure Pipelines free went much faster than Travis / CircleCI (6 min instead of 30), which is great. Expanded a lot on what Travis and AppVeyor were doing, configuration looks more verbose but takes advantage of more functionality. Next major milestone would be to connect a non-free GPU instance (could be Windows to test DirectX and OpenGL on same host) for GPU accelerated testing. GPU accelerated VMs could come from another cloud provider if needed. | Emily: is OCIO v2 to be announced at SIGGRAPH? Mike: no hard date yet, probably still a year of work, so can talk about new work / projects, but too early for an official announcement, still focused on 1.x releases. | John: OpenVDB and OpenColorIO making progress on CII badging, hopefully by SIGGRAPH we should have a couple of projects close to meeting all requirements (hangup typically on designated security expert). | Ending early . | Next meeting . | 19 June 2019 | Daniel on leave for next 3 weeks, will hand over chair duties to John | . | .

    "content": ". | General CI discussions / announcements . | Andrew: had meeting with Microsoft about Azure about upcoming issues: . | GitHub logins will be coming to Azure | ability to create “elastic pool”: for now we would need to create a pool of GPU enabled instances running at all times, but will be possible to dynamically scale pool of resources up and down | ability to purchase more parallel processing | . | Aloys: unclear on how a pipeline in a ASWF pipeline can work on a fork of a project? Andrew: when you raise a PR against a ASWF project, you will run the Azure Pipeline under the ASWF Azure Pipelines instance. If you do it on a fork, would have to be your “own”. | Aloys: what about if you want to create a PR on the azure_pipelines.yaml? You can’t create a fresh pipeline through a PR, but you can edit an existing pipeline. So a potential for a “denial of service”, could be a way to rate limit the amount of CI. Should there be a list of “recognized contributors” that can fire off Azure builds unrestricted? LF Engineering will be keeping track of Azure resource usage. | Aloys: if I create a PR which starts a job, can I requeue the job / manipulate the job? Andrew: this will be easier once we have unified logins, can grant specific rights. Need to ask Microsoft about “comment based triggering”: leaving a comment on an open PR could trigger a job (if you are whitelisted). Note sure if Azure Pipelines currently supports this, this is how LF RelEng does this on their Gerrit based projects. | . | OpenVDB | OpenColorIO . | Michael: outstanding PR to switch CI to Azure, incorporates SonarCloud, everything working well, discussing enabling SonarCloud on all PR builds since Azure builds are fast enough. Their VFX Reference Platform Docker image should be based on CentOS rather than Ubuntu. Aloys: the gotcha with the DTS is the funny tricks it uses to allow C++ compiled apps to run with the “old” runtime, so the binaries are quite different. That may break the assumption that our projects / binaries are as “vanilla” as possible and can be easily modified. Looking into adding standard images to ASWF Docker repo, combining OpenVDB and OpenColorIO scripts. Michael: would be useful to have both the recipe and pre-build Docker images that we can build on top of. Docker images currently being pulled from Michael’s private Docker repo, to be merged into official repo. Michael: overall very pleased with Azure Pipelines. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: getting back from being away, no meeting since then. Will be following up on getting Azure setup incorporated. From conversation with Dan Bailey, would be useful to have a basic “hello world” Azure Pipelines setup. Andrew: we had one for OpenVB. Cary: will check into the repo to look at the original version. | Hello world pipeline from OpenVDB https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb/pull/450 | Andrew: Microsoft recommends using the built in editor in Azure Pipelines to build azure_pipelines.yml file (based on Visual Studio Code editor) | GitHub offering new feature for “template based repositories”: https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/ Could be used not just for CI, CII requirements, documentation files, an ASWF “skeleton” repository | Andrew: will be able to give “manager” rights for Azure Pipelines to repo admins | Was working on updating the README files, documentation, need “good” examples of how to do this. | Aloys adding a dummy / sample Azure Pipelines YAML file to the Docker repo which can be used as an example. This will probably be Linux only (unclear if it’s worth using Docker images on Windows). Michael: only using Docker on Linux, native on Windows, macOS. Andrew: went ahead and created the dummy Azure Pipelines YAML. Andrew: need additional maintainers on the Docker repo, for now he’s the only one. | JF: there should be a “canonical” way to structure multi-platform builds | . | OpenCue | . ",

Large number related to CMake / build system, CMake more than anything else. | Kimball is working on a CMake standard template projects | Repo transition to ASWF github transition? Not clear date yet, and not yet completely clear on what is required for this to happen.

CI pull request will also address a lot of CII requirements. | . | OpenVDB . | Dan: primarily looking at Azure Pipelines, building on top of Aloys work for Docker images. | Outstanding pull request on ASWF docker image, small issues, pulling different pieces of software from package managers vs building from source. | Minor issue related to GLFW library | Everything else is building correctly, unit tests are running | Merging this pull request once happy | Will start to expand the Docker image to include VFX Reference Platform | Some experimentation on personal Azure account to address Houdini builds, cannot be included in the public Docker image. | Andrew: Azure Pipelines provides private container registries. Dan: currently using Docker Hub. | Set up quick test with registry keys for private Docker image repo | Images can be lighter if we pre-download Houdini and only extract the libraries we need, could also have an image with multiple Houdini versions. | Windows / Mac builds, SonarCloud integration still on todo list | Looking at security-related issues, no reported issues so far (easy to meet that CII criteria), but working on a document about the security posture of OpenVDB, will be added to the repo (TSC directory). | . | Next meeting . | 3 July 2019 | . | .

Previously using Ubuntu as base image, moving to CentOS 7 caused a few issues related to GLFW, decided to bump up to more recent version. | Just waiting for official ASWF Docker Images to put in PR, waiting for Andrew to push these out. | Azure Pipelines integration is just a basic “hello world” fornow, then targetting VFX Platform 2019, 2018 and Houdini builds. | Haven’t had much time to look at SonarCloud yet, looking at examples from OpenColorIO | Some outstanding CII-related issues, worked with John Mertic, taking conservative approach to stating compliance for some of the items. | Probably won’t be done by SIGGRAPH but will have some progress done. | Big goals for SIGGRAPH for OpenVDB itself. | Daniel: what has OpenVDB settled on for Houdini downloads, pre-install vs installing at run time? Dan: seems like the simplest approach will be to add Houdini version in a private image that can only be accessed if you sign the EULA. Get one private image with Docker Hub for a personal account, but not for an organization account. Can trim away Houdini components that aren’t needed for build / test, support building against 3 separate Houdini versions. Should we sign up for a paid account? Andrew: Azure Pipelines does have a private Docker registry, not sure if that requires a paid account? Aloys: looks like you need paid account for private image repos (and pay by storage amount). Andrew: we have a Nexus3 system in the ASFW CI account, we could use that to run a private repository (we normally run those public). Daniel: given the EULA requirements for Houdini Apprentice, are we giving up the ability to run Houdini build / tests for private / pre-PR builds?

He has been working on CI issues and has Azure set up for OCIO builds (at least prototype going). Drew inspiration on OpenVDB.

OpenVDB will incorporate these ideas back. | Larry: some of the progress would not have been happening without ASWF | Daniel: we should have at least one graduated project by SIGGRAPH.

Conda has some of these packages already available, Rez could work by combining work from previous studios. | Jeff: are we looking to have completion on this in July? Feel like something we can’t solve in 1 month. | Daniel: agreed, but should have at least started down the path, and define what’s achievable. | Dan: what is liked about the Docker approach is that everything is installed in a “vanilla” way, typical of how our users are likely to have things installed. So this tests a valuable part of what we want to deliver. But don’t want to fall in the middle ground between the hobbyist user and the large studio use case. | Daniel: for SIGGRAPH we are hosting on Open Source day a Rez BOF, so could talk again to the Rez folks as to how it can be leveraged for CI applications. | One set of Docker recipes works well, but no Docker macOS, could work on Windows, but would need to integrate the compiler inside the container image.

Yes, nothing happens outside the single session track. | Same during Open Source day, would be good to have people to man tables / hang around to ask questions. | Brian: need to coordinate events with other Google events. | There will be AV available. | Need to RSVP for “Beers of a Feather” event | . | OSS Maintainers meeting . | ASWF + non ASWF projects: connect with other people doing OSS projects in the industry. Primary goal is NOT recruiting, use as opportunity to learn how we can support the broader community. Other events to promote ASWF membership. | Fairly small audience, 35-40 seats, invitation based. Best if invitation comes from people who already have connections to projects. Please add suggestions on the spreadsheet being circulated. | John suggesting we should prime the agenda with points from survey being circulated to invitees. | Daniel will be busy at SIGGRAPH with ASWF and other commitments, reached out to Larry to help lead the session. | Emilly: projects that have good talking points about benefits / impact of ASWF membership should share those. Will send template of what kind of talking points would be helpful. By July 12th. | Cary: some of the updates for OpenEXR may only drop very close to SIGGRAPH (CII badge for instance) | Every project should be represented at the ASWF BoF. | . | . | Technical Project updates (0:20-0:40) . | OpenVDB . | Dan: all remaining CII items ticked off except static analysis. | SonarCloud builds are working, not discussed impact in TSC meeting yets. | SonarCloud raised issue of an empty “catch” statement (as 5 separate security issues). Trying to understand the meaning / importance of this report. | Takes quite a long time to run, especially the code coverage (2.5 hours to run through test suite). So can’t be used on every commit, but that’s not required for CII badge. | Some of the language of static analysis says that static analysis must be applied to major production release, that hasn’t been done before, but would be applied to next one. | Andy: suggestion is that you don’t need to run it all the time, but running it once a week (or even month) is enough to meet CII badge requirements. We can set up the CI system to run it automatically on a regular schedule. | Major release planned for SIGGRAPH, so that release could be done under the CII badge process. Dan: release will actually happen after SIGGRAPH. | Dan: can run SonarCloud in non-automated way for now. Daniel: enough to meet CII requirement. | Requirement to address vulnerabilities relates to official, reported (CVE) vulnerabilities. | . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: getting ready to merge updates that redo CI and static analysis, working with Dan and Aloys to get this set up. | Will allow to update lots of requirements for CII badge | 80% of CII badge for now | Still need to address security-related issues being discussed on TAC list | Embedded external dependencies: being resolved in CMake / install scripts, expect to be done in a week or so. | Shouldn’t be a huge deal to get worked out | Dan: are you using the ASWF Staging Images? Michael: yes, also using the base image and installing their dependencies on top of that. | SonarCloud run takes about 30min, coverage takes the most time | Could there be two levels of SonarCloud, usual static analysis on every build, then a full coverage analysis once a week / before major release? | Michael: running full analysis over weekends, could be divided. | Daniel: collaboration between projects to help with these efforts is really encouraging. | Dan suggested adding “long names” to make sure that headers aren’t being tested multiple times in every place they are included. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: Quiet TSC month in June due to travel / vacation, getting back into it this month, plus SIGGRAPH. | Some good progress on the transfer of the project, repo is transfered, CLA is in place, domains are transferred. Only remaining part is CI system. | Had talked about transferring Jenkins system, but it looks like Azure Pipelines system would work fine, so that’s likely where the project will end up. Enough similarity in the job description languages. | Majority of recent contributions from third parties, one contributor added Python 3 compatibility to a component, so very encouraging. | Next on the list: working on the CII badge, made progress on unit test coverage. Will be working through other badge requirements over coming weeks. | SIGGRAPH is next big thing, scheduling challenges with Google events, in process of getting resolved. Should have proposed agendas for events next week, will circulate to TSC. | Based on contributions, issues and list discussions, it seems there are people using OpenCue in production, enough to find and fix issues. Hard to tell the exact user base. Should there be a survey at the BoF? Yes, primary goal to figure out what the community is, finding priorities and turning it into roadmap. | . | OpenEXR . | Larry: in OpenEXR older CVEs are not easily reproducible, or misuse from the calling program rather than the library itself. How do you get rid of a CVE when you think “it’s not your fault”. Cary: has some leads on some security folks, but how do you make sure that the CVE database at Mitre.org gets updated to note that something has been fixed? Wants to speak to an expert before submitting updates. | There’s a CVE from 2006 without instructions on how to reproduce. There’s an EXR file that’s claimed to crash Safari but is no longer reproducible. Daniel: clang-ASan is a good tool to address this. | Some of the CVEs have valgrind logs attached to them | CII badge currently at 76%. Kimball has changes to address all compiler warnings, on the cups of being warning free. | Security issues: one is addressed in upcoming release, one is being discussed how to fix. Others have been addressed in previous releases, so need to update the documentation | First pass on SonarCloud by Christina, working on coverage now, looking forward to coverage report. She will reach out to Dan to get the Azure PIpelines setup sync’ed up. | Working on slide deck for SIGGRAPH BoF. | Hoping to have a release out, or at least announce an upcoming release. | Want to discuss the reorganization of the repo at the BoF, especially splitting out imath component. | Also want to review the discussion from last year: standardization of metadata, support for a fast / lightweight version of the library for apps that don’t need the full functionality. | Spent time looking at 100% GitHub issues, lots are related to Python bindings to OpenEXR. There are external projects that aren’t part of OpenEXR project itself, but issues are being reported against the OpenEXR projects. Is there an opportunity to leverage the ASWF to try to coordinate with these “adjacent” projects? | John: these are open source projects? Cary: yes. An example: “pip install openexr” fails. But that’s not part of the OpenEXR project itself. | John: do we know the maintainers of these projects? | Larry: suggests people use OpenImageIO for Python bindings to OpenEXR | Kimball has CMake updates, any consensus on minimal CMake version for projects? Pushing for 3.11 which is included in RHEL 8, would prefer 3.12. Larry: does it matter? | Larry: has been reporting this issue for a long time in context of VFX Platform. | Can have multiple CMake versions in parallel. | FindPython has been changed in recent CMake. | Daniel: do we need to support alternate code paths for different versions of CMake. | Kimball: 3.11 has full support for cppcheck static analysis. | Dan: OpenVDB figured minimum Ref Platform supported (2017) and earliest CMake version from that year. | Wants to discuss it at the BoF | Cary: looking at the GitHub issues, it’s built on a lot of obscure platforms, issues filed by packagers on various Linux distros. Lots of communities that care about building OpenEXR that are not represented at the TAC, how do we reach these people? Is there a better forum? Openexr-dev mailing list is one. | Daniel: this is a tricky issue, good topic for the BoF. We may need to use our individual contact networks to try to reach some people. | Maybe at Linux-related, non ASWF events? | . | . | CI updates (0:40-0:50) . | Working group | . | Next meeting . | 17 July 2019 | . | .

Test coverage says 78%, although because of build issues some tests weren’t included in this initial run so it’s likely higher. | Several of the SonarCloud warnings were in the test suite itself rather than the library itself. The advice is generally good, but no real emergencies identified. The “empty catch” warning were in the test suite, not the code itself (being fixed in a PR). Fixed by putting an other set of assertions in the catch block. | Kimball is still working on a revamp of the CMake setup. | Still crickets on all fronts looking for advice from security experts, no leads have yet panned out. | Should OpenEXR integrate with Google’s OSS-Fuzz? Sounds great, but we fear being beholden to a bot with a short fuse. | Peter and Kimball have made good progress on the backlog of outstanding bugs, including ones reported by Google Autofuzz. Several issues have involved buffer overflows due to 32-bit integer overflow with extremely large images or data windows, which we nevertheless feel are important to properly support. | . | OpenCue | .

Haven’t satisfied all the optional requirements yet, but have reviewed those optional requirements. | Running CI off the Azure platform, transitioned from the Circle CI platform. | Until now have had a pretty loose security requirement for downloading Houdini, password now stored in a Azure CI variable instead of hardcoded. What happens if you fork the repo into your own CI? SideFX could add a conditional to avoid those builds if you don’t have the environment variable set. Houdini is not baked into the Docker images, it is downloaded every time. | Houdini download is around 2m so not a bottleneck. Could there be a partial Houdini download? | There is documentation as to how to set up your own Houdini manual builds, a bit more complicated in a CI. On the list to transition to using the Houdini download API rather than the current mechanize Python module approach. | If your own SideFX account has access to beta / pre-release versions it is useful to run builds against that to make sure nothing has broken. | . | Michael / OCIO: currently at 97% on the CII badge, 2 remaining items related to security, talking to Dan / OpenVDB as to their approach. Once security document / policy is established should be able to complete last 2 items. | Michael / OCIO: Azure Pipelines is live, including static analysis, badges on the home page. Working on resolving embedded dependencies, and download of upstream dependencies. Want to make it “friendly to build”, exploring multiple options. | Andrew: what’s the status of migrating to ASWF repo? Michael: waiting on resolving external dependencies. Waiting on some people on vacation. Andrew: OpenEXR and OpenColorIO not under ASWF. Michael: OpenColorIO Examples repo is a bit more complicated due to copyright / license issues of some of the contents, may stay under Imageworks repo for now. | Dan: question to Andrew about Azure Pipelines permissions, which are extensive, could some of those be opened up to certain contributors? Andrew: in the past LF RelEng has kept control on the CI environment, but some of this has to do with Jenkins environment where setting variables gives full control. But very open to discussion to leverage fined grain permission mechanism in Azure Pipelines. | Andrew: Linux RelEng helpdesk, if you open an issue you will be added to the ASWF community and will show open issues, also may be able to comment on issues and view resolutions. | Andrew: ASWF is still the only LF project using Azure Pipelines, Gerrit/Jenkins and GitHub/Jenkins is still the landscape of other projects. LF CommunityBridge has a component to help people to onboard project onto CI, currently integrating CircleCI but may be targeting Azure Pipelines next. Some other larger projects are considering it. | . | Brian: OpenCue at 40% of the CII badge process, halfway through looking at the initial requirements.

Larry, any advice on version of LLVM (which version is OSL using)? Larry: would recommend staying close to the current version as much as possible. They are currently on version 8, working towards version 9. OSL supports a few different versions, every once in a while LLVM makes a major change that makes support difficult, but recent releases have been incremental. OSL supports LLVM 5, 6, 7 and 8, but doesn’t require a lot of #ifdefs. Stated policy is to support current version and the one right behind it, and then support new versions as long as the OSL version is current. Don’t have great data about what other projects are using, and not included in VFX Reference Platform. If introducing it as a new dependency that you didn’t have before, recommend starting with the latest version. Dan: should this be added to the VFX Reference Platform? Larry: it would be good to have a set of guidelines about common dependencies, and would include LLVM in there. Maybe it does belong in Reference Platform, OpenVDB adding LLVM creates the possibility of a single app having two versions of LLVM included. Traditionally VFX Reference Platform has focussed on dependencies of the major DCC apps. Worth an email to the VFX reference platform / discuss at the SIGGRAPH BoF. | . | . ",

Won’t happen this year. | Having the foundation behind them has been helpful, same people involved but the formal process and organization has been helpful. | OpenCue | Brian: Set up Azure pipeline, will provide more updates at CI meeting. | .

    "content": ". | Welcome new member: Sean Looper (AWS) | Welcome new project: OpenTimelineIO (Pixar) | Review of Year 1 . | Goals and progress . | 5 projects, one graduated, good progress on CI system | . | Friction points . | Cary: security seems to remain a concern, need to consult with an expert. Sean: AWS might be able to provide some resources. Cary: having a security expert give a presentation to the TAC would be helpful. We had that for the CII badge, but want it more focussed to security per se. May need to create a security working group. We understand the code and the security implications, but how do we handle reports where a low probability compromise would result in a large performance hit? | Cary: Google suggested the oss-fuzz project be applied to OpenEXR, we decided that the 2 week bug report period was beyond our abilities to deal with. | Larry: is there a way we can run the oss-fuzz ourselves without turning on the actual “service” so we get an idea of our exposure? How often would we expect to get reports? | Brian: Google runs it internally due to internal use of OpenEXR. | OpenEXR does have fuzz testing, but they take hours to run. | Brian: has been looking for security resource internally, but hasn’t found one yet. | Daniel: we need to set the norms for our own projects, and understand the processes for updating a CVE report (for instance). | Larry: we probably don’t need a lot of handholding, just having a checklist we can rundown would be a good start, we could do that ourselves. We may not need a lot of long term “hand holding”. | Daniel: we can rely on internal resources, or try to hire an external consultant. | Gordon: non airgapped applications (operating systems) are using our projects, so “security is coming for us” whether we like it or not. Our goals for next year should be broader than the CII badge. | Sean: what would be the expectations from a security expert from a member company: regular cadence review board, a visit to discuss best practices? | Daniel: really we’re looking for clarity on approaches, someone we can go through the details of how this would apply to our projects. But also need someone with ongoing responsibility, integrate into CI infrastructrure. | Gordon: we need to establish our security posture, how do we respond. | CVE fixes are often one line fixes, but how do you communicate back that something was fixed in a specific version. | Sean: having a security expert “on call” without compromising their day job commitments. | . | . | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Diversity . | Daniel: we’ve discussed diversity goals but have not made progress. What mechanisms do we have, and what should we seek to do. | Cary: realized the TSC needs more people, we need to look around ourselves for more than just “the usual suspects”. One of the benefits of participating are the networking opportunities, which is something attractive to offer. Also opportunity to nurture “future generation”. | Erik: What are the specific goals for diversity, many of our member organizations have formal internal efforts in that respect. | Larry: some of us represent projects, so of us represent member companies, but we’ve been involved in this field for a while. Getting people involved with projects and the TSCs for the projects is a way to bring more diversity to the TAC. | John: TAC is open body, anyone is welcome to attend / participate, the only restriction is on voting of project acceptance. | Erik: excluding people from voting can be awkward… | Gordon: Autodesk hired a director of diversity, could organize to have this person present to us what that implies? General agreement that this would be a good idea. | Sean: are we trying to make the whole group more diverse or voting members? Or projects? Yes to all. | Emily: we should set a formal group that each TSC + TAC has at least one person who meets diversity requirements. | . | TAC chair election . | TAC chair tenure is one year, and comes up in September. | . | Gordon: do we want to have a goal on the number of projects? | Emily: should we have a more formal survey of our community, above the simple straw poll from the ASWF SIGGRAPH BoF.. | Gordon: Foundation has been running for a year, are we going to survey the community to learn how we’ve done? Yes, this is happening (John). | John: presenting straw poll results from ASWF BOF. What should ASWF solve for Open Source projects: . | Legal Framework | Versionitis | … | . | Open source projects that should be submitted: . | USD | OIIO | Rez | OpenSubdiv | Aces | DJV | …. | . | Seems a bit like “what project do you like”? Larry: there’s definitely something to people wanting to see USD. | Areas of new development: . | Media Player | Metadata | Imath extracted from OpenEXR | Rig exchanging | Asset management | Context management | Compositor | Monitor calibration | Fabric Engine replacement | Cloud Services | … | . | Gordon: seems a lot of these could be grouped under “rigging”. | Any other areas ASWF should concentrate on: . | VFX Reference Platform: what does this mean? Erik: we should be clearer about the dependencies / overlap with VFX Reference Platform | 4 or 5 choices related to documentation | Licensing considerations (GPL vs non GPL) | Need further consolidation of results | . | Gordon: there’s value in the physical manifestation of the VFX Reference Platform (Aloys Docker containers). Daniel: need further specifications (compiler flags..). | Survey results: majority of people attending “beers of a feather” and “open source day” not directly involved with open source projects. | Gordon: Autodesk has customers in multiple industries, including games. There’s a desire to have consistency / interchange between VFX and games, doing a lot of outreach to the games industry. Daniel: have had people from the games industry reach out, so there does seem to be interest. Epic is a member of ASWF. We recognize that the game toolset is increasingly part of our toolsets. There are amazing projects going on in the games industry, there’s value in getting more exposure to what’s happening there. | Sean: if our members say that a media player is their top priority, how should that influence our priorities? Daniel: we don’t prioritize specific types of projects, we haven’t initiated a project from scratch, but that’s not impossible. But “wide scale industry adoption” (if only potential) remains an important criteria. | Emily: additional working groups may be appropriate to address results of the survey (straw poll or more formal survey). | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenTimelineIO . | Joshua: Need to offline figure out their next steps, lots of work to be done. Talking to other projects about how their TSC is structured since that needs to be created. When people are on the TSC / TAC are they representing as an individual or their company? Wasn’t clear from reading all the charters. Need help for onboarding. John: can definitely help with that, can be worked offline. Gordon: should be captured in FAQ. John: yes. Cary: join one of the other TSC meetings to see how it goes. | Have a pretty clear idea of the future roadmap, know the Pixar and other contributors, but would like to get some ideas from software vendors, to help drive native implementations. For instance was OpenEXR support a “push” or “pull” model. Gordon: Autodesk creative finishing group is very interested, can provide names of people who would be interested, possibly joining TSC. Joshua: sometimes can be difficult to get companies to engage in public discussion. Daniel: Linux Foundation can help with that. Sean: should there be an official mechanism for that (i.e. interacting with commercial vendors). Erik: members of the foundation who represents customers of these packages have influence, and should try to tell vendors that they want this functionality. Sean: providing a mechanism for “matchmaking” between users and software vendors. We can enable the project maintainers, and help them communicate with vendors. Gordon: the most compelling story is when you can show great workflows. Sean: vendors want to see actual demand from industry. Daniel: ASWF offers a number of mechanisms, both formal and informal. | Developers inside facilities often “don’t know what they don’t know” with respect to security. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: Very interesting SIGGRAPH so far, great turnout at Open Source Day BoF. Lots of interest, lots of sidebar conversations. But not a lot of actual adoption. Not unexpected, new project, lots of work to switch render queue systems. Need to focus on actual adoption going forward. | Focus on documentation, deployments, workflows. Looking for ideas in that area. | Collected a lot of feature requests from Q&amp;A, long list of features to work on. But new features may not drive actual adoption. | Proper Windows support is high on the list. | Fully migrated to Azure Pipelines. Was caught off guard by transition from a single Jenkins instance to a build system without persistence (rebuilding Docker images from scratch taking more time). | Progress on CII badge, finished initial pass through, 83% so far. Looking at static analysis and unit tests. | Will publish a roadmap for the next while based on feedback from SIGGRAPH events. Will dictate what Google’s work will be focussed on, and what others might want to work on. | Daniel: laying out roadmaps that identify specific areas where external contributors and work is a good idea. | . | OpenVDB . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: good turnout at BoF, was good that it followed ACES. Gave update on incubation status, about ready for graduation vote. Completed CII badge requirements, need to rerun license scan. | Two outstanding pull requests for licensing and contributors. | Most of the licensing related issues have been addressed. | Daniel: any traction on resourcing? Michael: Method offered some help with documentation, Netflix may be interested in contributing as well. | Efforts at identifying “first issues” for new contributors. | Patrick: CI build system is running, SonarCloud static analysis. A lot of false positives, trying to fix the ones that are relevant, but that generates a lot of noise, especially for security related issues. Would be helpful to get guidance there. | Is there an ideal way to respond to static analysis false positives? Comments in the code, or squelching results in SonarCloud? What if we disagree with what SonarCloud is reporting? | You can add comments to disable some warnings. | Larry: not much choice but to look at what’s reported. | Long term would be great if a “clean” SonarCloud report would be used to gate builds that break it. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: good session yesterday. | CII badge: getting close. Azure / Sonar Cloud is up and running. As soon as the latest build issue is fixed will make new release. | A couple of people have reached out from the community and will attend next TSC. | . | . | CI updates . | Working group | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 14 August 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Welcome new members [0:00 - 0:10] . | Sean McDuffee (Intel) . | Working with Jim Jeffries, used to be at Blue Sky in R&amp;D dept, working on rendering and simulation, 8 shows over last 10 years. Joined Intel 2 months ago, enthusiastic about ASWF. | . | Pilar Molina (Blue Sky Studios) . | Senior Software Engineer in R&amp;D Dept, works with Mark McGuire, animation and rigging tools, has worked closely with Animal Logic and Autodesk on Maya/USD | . | Michael Min (Netflix) . | Will be representing Netflix on the TAC, will get up to speed on the documentation, based in the LA office. | . | . | SIGGRAPH recap [0:10 - 0:20] . | ASWF BoF . | John: feedback from attendees, we had around 300-400 attendees, very satisfying turnout, great work from Emily on organization. At lot of great engagement questions. Demographics profile: beers of a feather: 50/50 split between familiar/involved with ASWF and new, similar profile for Open Source Day. Plurality of attendees not involved in specific projects, getting lots of new people “in the room”, individual projects need to work on bringing in some of these new people. Highest priorities perceived: build/CI environment, versionitis, shared legal framework. Most “popular” projects which should become ASWF projects: USD, OIIO, Rez, OpenSubdiv, ACES… Strong interest in an open source media player, metadata initiatives, imath as a standalone project… Also very strong interest in tighter connection between ASWF and VFX Reference Platform, as well as focussing on documentation. | Sean: are we expecting to pick some topics and create working groups? Daniel: yes, we can create working groups to address some specific topics such as documentation, but for something like a media player, other models may be more effective, for instance identify a specific existing project or product that could be adopted / supported / open sourced. Kimball: there are several media players, we should identify what specific features we need (scripting for instance) | . | OSS Maintainers meeting . | Larry (meeting host): several maintainers of other projects in our ecosystem, as well as leaders of ASWF projects. Somewhat informal discussion on “hot topics”, 2 main take aways: . | A good chance to get people from other projects to see what ASWF can do (especially CI system) without it being a “selling opportunity” | Discussion centered around general problems faced by all projects: how to keep a healthy level of developer contribution, especially from studios using the project. Also recruiting, and how to encourage some diversity, how do you get new blood coming into the projects, all projects are facing the same types of issues. | . | Daniel: some good examples from other projects of useful initiatives: . | Cloud Native Compute Foundation: https://landscape.cncf.io/ | Effort to revive “Open Source VFX” web site | Examples of documentation: project level, as well as cross project initiatives | . | For non-ASWF projects: looking for high resolution logos to replace PNGs with SVGs (for scalability), to update Open Source VFX web site | Imageworks has some projects that aren’t on the Open Source VFX web site, would be good to get updates on these projects so they can be added | BoF videos will be up on YouYube in a few days | . | TAC retrospective and prospective . | Security experts (Sean, Kimball) . | Kimball: Dan Hutchison was working as security engineer before The Foundry, has offered to help | Sean: looking for additional context on how to engage with group of security experts, should this be a working group with ad hoc cadence, or something less formal. Daniel: will work with Sean to come up with a working model, we tried a few different approaches early on, but were lacking the resources back then. | . | . | . | Technical Project updates [0:20 - 0:45] . | OpenCue . | Gathering feedback from SIGGRAPH to merge into project plan | Ramping up new TSC members, having design discussions | Priority to make progress on CII badge, initial pass is complete. Static analysis / SonarCloud setup in progress, also working on increasing test coverage. CII badge is forcing emphasis on test coverage, which is great. | Velocity on accepting external contributions is not as high as desired due to lack of test coverage. | Chatting with Linux Foundation RelEng to merge with ASWF SonarCloud org instead of using personal one. | Have we agreed on the general level of test coverage required for CII badge? Have any of the other projects set a benchmark? Michael: OCIO aiming for 80%, Kimball: OpenEXR at 82%. Brian: 80% sounds like a place to start. | Starting to use ASWF base Docker Images, nothing in there covers Java / JDK, should there be? Daniel: a good topic for the CI working group? (CI working group not wrapped up, just looking at necessary cadence going forward) | . | OpenTimelineIO . | Cory: no specific updates, back from vacation, need to follow up with Josh to gather SIGGRAPH feedback, questions on how to form the TSC. Will update at the next meeting. Daniel: has been involved in a couple of conversations. | . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: completed all the requirements to pass license scan, except for some exceptions that need to be approved by governing board. John: agreed, overall in pretty good shape. | Michael: some work on updating licensing statements in source code, such as using SPDX. When is it OK to replace copyright notices? Will talk to Autodesk and Imageworks to see if those statements can be completely replaced. | Ready to move project over to ASWF GitHub org, but waiting for some CLAs to be signed, don’t want project to get blocked because of those. | . | OpenVDB . | No representatives on call | . | OpenEXR . | Kimball: narrowing down last few bugs to get Azure Pipelines running on all 3 platforms, will then tag for 2.4.0 release. | Added a couple of static functions, thus 2.4.0, hopefully by Labor Day | 95% on CII badge | Daniel: any further discussion on “imath library extraction” based on SIGGRAPH feedback? Kimball: no further discussions past SIGGRAPH in OpenEXR TSC. Larry: might want to extend the discussion to the TAC, and maybe take a specific position? Daniel: seems that CI integration / next release are the current priorities. | Eric: what was the specific feedback at the BoF regarding this split? Larry: no extensive discussion at the BoF, the vector/matrix stuff wasn’t controversial, but should we also split off “half”, is there an alternative FP16 format to be supported? Machine Learning apps tend to use a different format (that was new information). Not ready to elevate that to the TAC level. | Larry: need to make sure that anything that is done with Half is compatible with what happens in CUDA. | . | . | CI updates [0:45 - 0:50] . | Working group goals / cadence . | Migration into ASWF orgs from personal (Sonar etc) . | Access privileges | Andy: Brian requested connecting up Sonar Cloud, best to do this via tickets, but will create “committer groups” that will have admin rights for their repositories. | Also “Self service committer promotion”, can automate via a YAML files. Trying to standardize between Gerrit and GitHub. | Andy: Can add marketplace apps that can help with that. | Andy: self service repository creation via adding a file to a “control” repo, would help ASWF be more agile without having to rely on RelEng group for some of these connections / infrastructure. | . | Documentation | Base images: extend to include more components (e.g. Java) | Windows, Mac, GPU | Commercial components for build and test | Daniel: suggesting a monthly cadence for CI working group to make room for other initiatives | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | From survey results . | Media player . | Does anyone know the DJV people? | Larry: what do people want from a “media playback” tool? Do they really want a playback tool, or a collaborative dailies platform? | Sean: should we re-evaluate the survey, distill the data down to a new list, some kind of “mutually exclusive” results? | Larry: we don’t know who asked for this, not a single person at a studio. Hesitant to put a lot of time into something that got voted on somewhat casually. | Kimball: can we follow up with people who attended the events? Larry: at least post on the public TAC email list, if no one responds, then we probably don’t need to even think about it. | Gordon: do we know how many votes this got? Larry: not clear what that means. Gordon: how do we better act on this data. | John: can send the governing board slide deck to the TAC after this meeting. Also will post raw data as CSV. | Gordon: action item for next call to review the raw data? | John: we can also do a follow up larger survey to hone in better on what the data means. | . | John: talked to a few people as to what they meant by “metadata” answers: common interchange formats, common metadata interop between tools. Sean: also metadata captured on set and how to deal with that. But not clear what that means in the context of ASWF, and what that could translate to in practice. | John: “Documentation” should also be clarified. | Rez | Rigging / Evaluation | . | . | Next meeting . | 28 August 2019 | . | .

    "content": "Outstanding / Ongoing: . | CI Documentation, Guidelines . | Solidify the work we have done so far | . | Dependency management . | CMake find modules | Does this make most sense in CI context of a broader one | Not that much progress on “top of tree builds”, may change the approach from the current “pre built image” | Should we identify the tree of dependencies, ASWF / Ref Platform components | To whom would these top of trees be useful, if at all? If no one is looking at those builds, then they aren’t helping. | . | Gordon: leading into SIGGRAPH we talked about taking a “data driven approach”, asking the official members of the foundation as to what our goals should be. Did that happen / get done? Daniel: some of the data from the Open Source day was posted, but no official work to target the ASWF members. Gordon: what are the priorities that would “move the needle” for the second year after what got done the first year. Also getting feedback from the Governing Board. Daniel: that’s a very relevant activity, specific question of “top of tree builds” isn’t useful to anyone outside the project, so if anyone in this group isn’t interested, no point in doing it. But for the other ongoing activities, we have good feedback from the projects and the members that this is useful work. Gordon: should we take some time to define “success” so we are clear on what we are driving at. Larry: once a week top of tree across the projects would make sure that the projects haven’t drifted apart from each other API wise. Michael: OCIO has a weekly “top of trunk” build against its dependencies to make sure they don’t get surprised by changes in dependent projects. Some bash trickery to figure out the “latest” tag for those projects. Daniel: this could make sense to generalize across all the projects, or could be centralized to have cross project builds happen. Michael: will send via email. Larry: could be part of best practices document, we don’t necessarily need a complete separate process to do this. | Windows, Mac . | GPU . | Commercial components . | All 3 of these requirements have been reinforced by the Governing Board. We have support for Houdini, but we should aim to take this further. | Is there value in trying to do this in context of CI, or have it happen in the individual projects? | Are there resources outside the projects? Aloys doing work on Docker images for instance. | . | Aloys: has anyone have ideas in terms of staging strategies for Docker images? Was going to create a branch called “staging” for ASWF Docker which is where devs would create branches / PRs, only a manual merge to Master would create the official ASWF staging images. Does this sound like a good idea? Also, what is success for this project? At this stage used by all the Linux builds. GPU is next step. | Making use of Azure Pipelines caching to accelerate builds, but system is still in preview, and is not very flexible, no “fallback caching” available, either you get what you ask for, or nothing at all. | Happy to build images with Java JDK for OpenCue. | Next stage would be to use package manager such as Rez? Rez seems to be focussing on C++ building (as per SIGGRAPH BoF). Aloys: lack of fine grained control such as debug builds is an issue with Rez. Jeff: experimenting with fairly static definitions of debug vs opt builds under Rez. The features being presented at the BoF seemed to be quite complex. | Aloys: also artifact management: Conan has functionality for that, AL has done some work to integrate Rez with Artifactory, looking at perhaps contributing that back. | . New goals . | Investigate GitHub Actions CI? . | https://github.com/features/actions | https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions | Has anyone taken a look at it? | Larry: closed beta, asked for early access, but no response yet. | Aloys: hasn’t showed up in the UI yet | Michael: YAML syntax looks very similar, shared infrastructure with Azure Pipelines. | Larry: one stop shop offering for GitHub, not a pressing issue, but could be interesting for a future project. | Daniel: quick take seems that it isn’t quite ready for general use (“don’t use for production critical projects”), shifting to a different configuration language (HCL to YAML, which looks identical to AP YAML). Eventually may offer better GitHub infrastructure, avoiding extra layers of administration / access rights. | . | Standardization of additional dependencies? . | OpenCue: JDK . | Trying to standardize on ASWF Docker images, but missing some components. | Should we specifiy a range of versions that things should build against. | Java 8, Cmake | Not in VFX Reference Platform (Daniel), but still important | Brian: can forge ahead, and provide expertise as they learn | Brian: Was unable to install new packages in Docker images? Michael: was able to install on top of those images using “sudo yum install” (Aloys) | Aloys: Docker images in the repo, there’s a Docker image for each project that is there to add additional components, so could create one for the OpenCue project so they don’t need to do this in their build. Brian: will send a PR for that. | Michael: “latest revision” infrastructure for external dependencies uses the common Docker image. | . | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Governing Board Update [0:00-0:05] . | BOF videos from SIGGRAPH now on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZw_4upNTdoGjQfvim_5MhA | Some of the requests from SIGGRAPH meetings conveyed to the Governing Board | Finalizing goals for the first year, David Morin’s term ends end of September | Still have change to make TAC goals from first year | Asked about financing for GPU testing: funds can be made available for setup and experimentation, but should follow up on offers from member companies for free or subsidized resources. Can take advantage of resources from external providers since they can be linked to Azure Pipelines CI. | Cary: Request for clear mission statement from projects (from Rob Bredow): each project should have a clear statement of scope, what it is, what it’s not, what are the boundaries. Could be included in documentation project. | . | Goals for TAC: Year 2 [0:05-0:15] . | Ongoing . | Previous CI and TAC calls: | . | Member survey (Gordon) . | Gordon pointed out the importance of serving the needs of our members. Surveys to augment our representative structures, kicked off process with John to find ways to gather this data (augment free form survey data from SIGGRAPH). Also make these processes less ambiguous, also ask members to consider “relative value” when submitting lists of priorities (the $100 test). | . | Security. Working Group? . | Making space for a working group by moving CI working group to a every 4 week cadence. Is anyone interested in starting up this process? | Kimball: started conversations with Daniel at Foundry | . | Kimball: Graduation of “senior” projects | Cary: need to make progress on Diversity and Inclusion. Explicit targets and metrics. | Larry: now that we have several projects in and more coming in, may be time to work on social aspects, normalizing the idea that people in studios should be contributing to the projects as part of their normal work. Daniel: Governing Board indicating that in the second year we should be more formal about drawing on engineering commitments of member companies. Larry: make sure that members are fulfilling their obligations, and normalizing the idea of not just fulfilling commitments, but also cutting the red tape to contribution. Could start to identify the barriers to contribution, even casual contributions (few line bug fixes) can be very difficult to clear / get approved. Cary: broadening the community base in our projects would help this as well, avoid “single points of failure”. Need to make sure that people aren’t scared of contributing by the legal hurdles. Daniel: another opportunity for a survey to figure out what are the obstacles to contribution. In the OSS Maintainers meeting at SIGGRAPH some of these topics were discussed, as well as how to reach out to a wider base of contributors (students for instance), but also trying to “unlock” experts in studios using these projects. | . | Documentation [0:15-0:20] . | aswf.io updates . | John: working on a landscape view of projects in our industry, trying to revive opensourcevfx.org web site | Emily: updates to aswf.io web site, adding to project documentation practices. Added more community content, need a section for CI, each project will have a separate page, currently just links to the project site, but will have specific pages linking to mailing list, repository. | Some of the project web sites need updates, there isn’t a good central place to get to all our projects. Would Confluence be a solution, or should we stick to GitHub as the single source of truth? Here’s an example: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/ which aggregates the status of a number of related projects. Hyper Ledger is similar to ASWF as an organization. | Will be creating some assets on GitHub: logos, slides… | . | CI (JF) | Projects (graduation requirement?) . | From OSS Maintainers meeting: we should make use of a documentation system / documentation quality requirement a criterion for project graduation. Some aspects are covered by CII requirements. Michael: OCIO has documentation, but project has changed rapidly, so hard to keep it up to date. Should demonstrate a “pattern” of documentation improvement. Kimball: do we mean something like Doxygen / ReadTheDocs / Sphinx for technical documentation? Larry: really likes ReadTheDocs / Sphinx, folds nicely into our CI philosophy, docs live within the source tree, system will rebuild the documentation on a commit. Also looks esthetically pleasing. Andrew: LF uses ReadTheDocs across multiple projects they manage, including internal RelEng documentation. Can do cross-project linking. Henry: it’s a good idea to indicate a level of expectation of documentation for our projects, reasonably up to date documentation. We have expectations of code quality, that should extend to documentation. Not sure if we want to prescribe a particular documentation system, should cover technical doc, user doc, and contributor doc. | Mission statements, roadmaps for projects, needed to keep projects healthy. Do projects feel they currently have a clear mission statement, both used internally, and externally discoverable? Or should we work explicitly on that. | Cary: OpenEXR started a discussion about gather reference images, could use some photos for reference images, what would we use those for? Would be used for calibration, which sounds useful, but is OpenEXR the right home for this, and is this within scope of the project. So brought up the discussion of project scope. Also question of splitting off imath, would OpenEXR become a “two headed beast” if it ends up managing two separate projects? Again goes to defining scope and mission. | Josh: OTIO spoke about this internally, what is the scope of the project within Pixar, what does and doesn’t get open sourced. Wrote down a project “elevator pitch” rather than a “mission statement”, more “what is the project” rather than “what should the project be”. Have pushed back on some requests (media playback for instance), but project scope may grow over time, hopefully in a controlled manner. | . | . | Technical Project updates [0:20-0:40] . | OpenCue . | No representative | . | OpenColorIO . | Michael: refining licensing on project, waiting for approvals from Autodesk. Waiting for some license sign off from Governing Board. Last steps before applying for graduation vote. John: should hopefully happen next week. | . | OpenTimelineIO . | Josh: John has been helping form TSC, first meeting last week. 2 people from Pixar, one from Netflix. Next meeting tomorrow, people from Autodesk and Dreamworks interested. Looking for active contributors. Switched mailing list and Slack channel to ASWF infrastructure, going through the list. For the Technical Charter, looking at subtle differences between the other project charters, looking for guidance from other projects as to what required those changes. Larry: some of the differences are probably not that meaningful, but the result of haggling between legal departments and various contributors. | Got into some discussion with Avid asking for more involvement. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: release “waiting in the weeks”, discussions on Boost issues, should now have builds on every platform. Also trying to resolve some license questions, a pull request was issued against document discussing patent requirements, but probably shouldn’t hold up the release. Should allow finishing off remaining items for CII badge, and should be able to propose graduation within next couple of weeks. | . | OpenVDB . | No representatives | . | . | CI updates [0:40-0:50] . | Working group. 4 weekly cadence. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 11 September 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Welcome to new members . | Michael Johnson (Apple) | Gerald Tiu (Microsoft) . | Director of M&amp;E at Microsoft Azure, covers from scripts to post. Came from industry, worked at Pixar and ILM, excited to work on projects with industry partners. | . | . | Follow ups . | CI documentation and sample project? (JF) . | Nothing to share yet, but still committed to it. Will take shape of personal GitHub repo, then to be moved to ASWF when fleshed out. | Daniel suggest that the sample project (“teapot project”) could be used to demonstrate the use of existing ASWF projects (EXR, OCIO…). Show cross project dependencies, CI integration… Should this be a separate project to avoid mixing a project that demonstrates structure vs a project that demonstrates cross project integration. | Gordon: components designed to work within a larger framework, how compeling an example can you build by gluing these components together? | Sean: can we justify this project by connecting the dots between the ASWF projects and new projects that would fill the gaps? | Michael Min: how far do we want to scope this effort? | Cary: haven’t heard discussions about an objective to build a complete pipeline within the context of ASWF. | Daniel: there are other groups that have as a goal a fully open source production pipeline. Was suggesting a more modest goal to show a tutorial for developers. | Cary: had feedback about issues building OpenEXR as a sub-project of another CMake-based project. So more examples of CMake integration between projects would help. | Eric: a project that links all other projects is the hardest thing to compile | . | Member survey to guide TAC and CI efforts (Gordon) . | Take our ad hoc surveys a step further, survey done at SIGGRAPH was not easy to determine “which voices are we hearing”. | Propose as a first step to do a deeper dive on the raw data that was gathered. | What are the questions we want to answer? | What would be the right survey questions to answer that? | . | We should have a post mortem of how well we’ve delivered on the expected value of the member companies in the first year. | Asking these questions seems to be larger than just the TAC, should this topic involve / be driven by the Governing Board? Do such discussions exist? | Daniel: first year strategy nominally runs until end of tenure of David Morin, in the process (with Daniel) of formulating goals for next year. Interested in hearing feedback from the TAC: next steps for CI, project needs… So it’s a two way interaction. | Gordon: can work with David, Emily, John and Daniel to help define this to help put this together. | Raw data: https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/message/860 | . | . | Annual TAC chair election . | Daniel’s tenure ends in September, discussed with John a process to elect next TAC char, will send out a call for nominations via email list. If there are more than one candidate we will vote. | Anyone interested should reach out to Daniel to discuss what was involved. Estimate 4-5 hrs per week. | . | VOTE: OpenColorIO Graduation proposal . | https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/message/908 . | Michael Dolan sent out proposal (see link above) | Healthy committer base across vendors, VFX companies and individuals | Healthy flow of merges and commits | Completed CII badge | License scan completed (initial issues with embedded dependencies and their licenses) | ASWF has really helped with organization of governance and structure, documentation, contribution, security… Highly beneficial to the value of the project, and help new participation. | Value of OCIO to ASWF mission: project is well adopted in the industry, including outside the VFX industry (games). Speaks for itself. Looking forward to OCIO v2 next summer. | Daniel: project has been excellent at contributing to TAC process, CI system, setting of direction. | Andrew: project not yet migrated to ASWF GitHub, but will be done soon. | Quorum is met | Daniel proposes motion for graduation, Gordon seconds. | Many ayes, no abstains, no against. Motion passes unanimously, will be recommended to Governing Board for graduated status. | . | . | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | CI | Dependency management | Security expertise and processes | Documentation standards and standardization | Vector / matrix library | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB | OpenColorIO | OpenEXR . | Cary: beta release is out, feedback about CMake issues when building in context of larger CMake-based project. | Will be working on more disruptive changes. | Moving repo to ASWF GitHub waiting on CLA setup (business / legal) | Eager to move on splitting imath to separate project. Will touch on issues of whether it’s a separate, independent project, in a different repo with different license, CLA… Or is there a notion of a “dependant” project that shares infrastructure? | Could ASWF project inherit from a base project for some infrastructure (licensing / doc)? | . | OpenCue | OpenTimelineIO | . | CI updates . | GPU build agents – hosting? . | Not covered by free Azure build agents | Andrew: Azure Pipelines does not support a free pool of GPU builders. In talk with representatives at Azure Pipelines, where is Microsoft on roadmap with dynamic pool? | We (LF) have found a way to pretty easily deal with the cost model to manage Azure resources. Would be an option to spin up some managed pools. | Brings up issue of Jenkins environment: recommend to turn down that environment to save those costs. There’s a non trivial amount of work to spin up that infrastructure, takes about 2 days of work to spin up that environment. | Kimball: do we see ever needing Jenkins in the future? Andrew: OpenCue went to Azure Pipelines directly. | Kimball: move to decommission Jenkins, Larry seconds. | All Ayes, no opposed or abstain. Vote carries. Andrew to stand down the ASWF Jenkins infrastructure costs. | Sean: AWS would be happy to provide funding for GPU instances. Can use any resources for Azure Pipelines builds. | May need to use Mac Stadium for Mac GPU, but OCIO is happy with just Linux for now for their test suite.

Need to get AWS account number for ASWF, and estimate of how much resources are required / estimated cost. Should be spun up on demand rather than running all the time. We don’t need the low latency of an “always on” GPU instance. | . | Commercial components . | Need to expand our base of software we can use at build / test time. | Gordon: Autodesk can donate licenses to ASWF to run tests, but where do we store the keys? Daniel: OpenVDB is using a stored key for Houdini (unclear how you share a key across a forked repository). No runtime testing for now, but should be runable with a Apprentice license. | Sean: AWS has usage based licensing for applications, so could also use that mechanism to use commercial licenses for testing (metered licensing). | Gordon: seems like we have some of the components in place, but unclear how it all fits together so we can run a test on a GPU instance that accesses licensed software. There needs to be an actual project to demonstrate how this would work. | Daniel: is there a project that already has Maya based tests? Dan: building against Maya SDK would be the first step. | Gordon: not clear who would review / approve the process. The ASWF will have to own some of the responsibility, will need to put a proposal to Autodesk. Sean: AWS has the ability to purchasing “hours” of usage ahead of time. Daniel: we might want to run these tests on other infrastructure than AWS, but this could help with the current, fairly narrow use case. Sean: Azure and GCP also provide this, may be simplest way to get to where we want to be. Gordon: is this already hooked up to Autodesk licenses? Sean: yes, mainly for rendering. Gordon: this could be the path of least resistance, but eventually would be preferable if Autodesk would donate licenses rather than charging. | . | . ",

Playing around with it for a couple of weeks, working for Linux and Mac, working on Windows (building, not tests yet). Seems equivalent to other CI systems, should offer nice integrated experience on GitHub. No run to run caching (so longer builds - no caching dependencies), missing polish for now. Would not recommend switching to it from another system right away, but seems promising. Interesting to see where it is in a year or 2. | Dan: permission model seems much simpler than Azure Pipelines. | JF: GitHub Actions agent is a fork of the Azure Pipelines agent. | Daniel: hopefully we can get some insight from our new Microsoft representative. | Beta now has instant acceptance (as of this morning) | Dan: just signed up for GitHub Actions, was able to copy over and adapt the existing azure_pipelines.yaml file to get a simple build going (most of the complexity is in the build scripts).

Wave: happy to help, asking what is involved in something like that? Daniel: perhaps create a working group (similar to CI group). Wave: maybe identify educational institutions that we could engage with. We need to define the ultimate goal: diversity within the group involved with ASWF, or the people we engage with? Daniel: all goals are on the table, we’re starting from pretty far behind. Most of our membership (TAC, project leadership) is not diverse. Could see this as an opportunity for engagement within our industry and with education. Could use ASWF associate membership model to reach out to other groups. Wave: also on board of Cartoon Art Museum in SF, dealing with similar issues, can reach out to leadership who are already working on this. Michael Min: there was a women in animation panel at SIGGRAPH, can reach out to organizers. Also can reach out to Women in Software meetup in LA last week. Larry: even the studios and R&amp;D teams in those studios is more diverse than ASWF / TAC, so should try to encourage internal people as well to get involved. Wave: will have something for next TAC meeting. Sean: we have individual TSCs, new working groups (security), so other opportunities for improving diversity. | . | Documentation, including mission statements . | ASWF landscape: ecosystem of VFX open source projects. Previously was opensourcevfx.org The CNCF created a tool to represent these landscapes which we are reusing for ASWF. Used projects either in opensourcevfx.org site and had some kind of GitHub repo you could point to (system only works for projects in GitHub). Also looked at lists from Disney and Sony. Larry categorized the projects. Gives an at-a-glance overview of open source activity. Also lets us identify gaps. There are some projects missing, and probably also dead projects that should be removed. CNCF threshold is that the project has to be related to the industry, also had to have a commit in last 6 months. Opensourcevfx added requirement that the project should have been used in an actual production. Where should we comment on this? Backed by GitHub, so can use GitHub commenting . | Template project (JF) Progress being made, feedback can be provided via GitHub. New items can be added as well. | Licenses for datasets and docs (John). Open Source projects typically use a Creative Commons license for documentation, images and other non code assets. For datasets the Linux Foundation as come up with the Community Data License with a permissive and a non permissive license. JF: how should we structure a dual license in a GitHub repo? John: using SPDX on each file to indicate which license they are under, can use SPDX as a comment in a MarkDown file. The code license is typically used to tag the overall GitHub repo, but will check with LF legal. Kimball: for datasets a separate repo is probably appropriate anyway. | Mission Statements: Need some good examples, guidance and structure for this. | . | Survey processes . | . | New members [0:10-0:15] . | Michael B.

Are there opportunities for generalization? . | Dave Fellows: is the scope security for all projects? Daniel: all projects, OpenEXR has some public CVEs so it has more exposure, and has been the first project looking at addressing security reports.

Gordon: might make sense to separate those audiences, could be a question at the start, or separate survey links? Emily: should have a single survey with a question “are you a member” at the start, and also “are you involved” (for people who are involved but not from member companies). | Larry: our analysis should try to boil down “one vote per member company” to make sure we deskew multiple answers from a single company? Gordon: try to avoid the “anonymous” answers from SIGGRAPH BoF. Maybe that’s why having separate links for members vs public at large would help with this? Larry: don’t want to be overly structured either. Disney has a single membership, but has multiple entities. Not clear how granular we want to be. | Emily: maybe this becomes two separate surveys, ask to share internally to our companies. But broader industry survey to see if there are gaps we need to be addressing. Our membership may not cover all aspects. Straw poll at SIGGRAPH BoF was attempt at getting feedback from outside our immediate circles. | Broader industry survey: open source use across the industry. | Daniel: we probably need to discuss this more via email, a few people seem to have expressed interest in this process. Quick discussion: what do we intend to do with this information. How do we show that we have taken on board the results of the surveys we have already done. We don’t want to keep asking people the same questions. Is it useful for us to produce some kind of “state of open source in the industry” document / summary. Similar to “state of DevOps” summary that goes out yearly. | https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/state-of-devops-report | . | Gordon: a lot of these questions we have not asked before. Make sure we capture all of the suggestions from previous surveys. Maybe the broader “state of the union of open source” needs to be a separate survey. We need to make sure that contributors view that they are “getting their money’s worth” of their efforts and contributions to ASWF. Although we may be repeating questions, knowing who is asking for what is important. | Larry: not clear we’ve gotten actionable feedback from SIGGRAPH survey. Daniel: also live polls during the summits. Gordon: do we have the results of those earlier polls? Larry: yes. But that data is 2 years old. Gordon: we only get one chance to ask for this data in the form we want. “Is this going to give us useful data to take action on”. Larry: we should ask to what extent they think they are filling their FTE commitments, andif not what are the blockers. Gordon: and what can we do to make it easier to contribute to ASWF. | Emily: how can we make the questions as specific as possible, ask specific questions so we have better insights / actionable data. | . | Diversity and Inclusion (Wave) . | Foundation, TAC and projects | External orgs . | CJANE | Women in film.org | Women in animation.org | Anita Borg / Grace Hopper conference | Phone calls to diverse industry members asking for recommends | Need to be careful about the message | Get a number of organizations, send to the TAC / governing board, “go look at these organizations, do you know anyone on their board / advisor lists, reach out and start a conversation”. | Michael Min: do we have an idea of what our message is supposed to be? Is there a specific objective, what are we trying to achieve? Wave: for now trying to identify relevant organizations who might have members / connections who could get involved in ASWF. We would like to get more voices, more points of view involved. Not prescriptive, but want to encourage “diversity of ideas”. Michael: are we trying to broaden the conversation, or trying to get more members / contributors from more diverse contributors? What would be the metrics? Wave: for now we should be looking at starting conversations. Example of ML-based software to look at gender roles in scripts at Disney. Maybe some of this is open sourced? | Wave: also can be helpful to look at membership of these organizations to establish links. | Emily: finding diverse contributors to open source is challenging, need to raise awareness. Could turn into a mentorship program. Are there goal in the TAC we want to set? Should each project have a woman on the TSC for instance? | Wave: gender is a good starting point, there are other “axis” to consider as well. | Pilar: should we be looking at quotas as well to set specific goals? | Emily: also putting together a list of relevant organizations, will send to TAC.

How do we tell people “what do we want to do?” | Daniel: every project has a description of what they are, some have “what we are not”, and that’s valuable as well. Goes partway towards informing what is a mission statement. There are different versions of these. Should we formalize this more, agree on language and terminology. | JF: how similar should ASWF projects be | Emily: have requested that projects have a link to ASWF, but there is benefit to having projects retain their own identity. | Daniel: there’s value in some standardization: ease of discovery, find information in consistent ways, quick start to get projects going, best practices. Infrastructure and tooling also sees value in standardization. This conversation has happened in various projects. There are many opportunities to add value, but we don’t want to be too prescriptive. | Michael Min: sat in on OCIO project TSC, questions of identifying personal vs institutional contributions. | Daniel: this would relate to governance documentation. Michael: discussion mentioned template projects to specify some mechanisms. | Daniel: need to ask questions of the board as to what they are actually looking for in terms of mission statements from projects. | Emily: sometimes the language is there but it is buried, so maybe just need more clarity / explicitness. | . | TSC FAQs (John) . | PR | Josh: OpenTimelineIO has found this information useful when setting up a new project. | . | Project success metrics (John) . | PR | . | Template Project (JF) . | Sample Project Repo . | Making progress on this, may need to reorganize structure to make it either an “information repository” or an “actionable template” project. | . | Sample Windows Container Repo . | Container builds are quite slow by default (takes a long time to pull container images from Docker Hub) | Could investigate storing container images on GitHub and/or Azure instead | . | CDash test dashboard . | Should all ASWF projects that use CTest aggregate test results on CDash? | . | . | . | Security [0:20-0:30] . | OpenEXR update (Cary, Kimball) . | Secure Development Lifecycle (Dave) . | Project reached out to Dave Hutchison at Foundry who joined las TSC call. | Gave thorough responses / indications on practical steps to approach security requirements for our industry. | Discussed how Foundry engaged with Google Fuzz group, support load.

There is interest on exploring on Mac and Windows, for instance OCIO has DirectX renderer, and when OpenGL fully goes away on macOS will need a Metal renderer. | Doug: differences in OpenGL implementations between platforms will only show up when you run tests on multiple platforms. | MacStadium: would we need to provision a bare metal instance? Wave: could help with that. Would need some kind of test matrix on Windows / Linux to see what would be required on the Apple side. Michael: can provide current OCIO platform matrix. | Azure, AWS and GCP offer Windows GPU-enabled instances, but of course they are not free. | Don’t think that WIndows containers support GPU acceleration . | DirectX is supported: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/gpu-acceleration | . | . | ASWF Docker images (Aloys) . | Azure Pipelines performance &amp; caching . | Windows containers are very slow! https://github.com/jfpanisset/windows-container-test . | Dave: could put us in touch with Azure DevOps team to discuss performance | . | macOS Docker doesn’t support macOS containers as far as we know . | Aloys: working on Qt build for a few weeks within Docker image, found that builds were running over 6h limit of free Azure Pipelines account. So restructuring to split building the packages from building the images. So one step to build boost, Python, Qt, create Azure artefacts, then another build that uses the artefacts to create a Docker container. So don’t have to “rebuild the world” when adding to the Docker images. | https://github.com/aloysbaillet/aswf-docker/tree/split-packages-from-image-builds | . | Limitations on what Azure Pipelines package management supports for public pipelines / repos. | Could build Qt locally and push to Azure packagement management for instance. | Still working on this . | Working on using Azure caching to save build time . | Should be no visible changes to the actual Docker images, but will improve and optimize the build process. | Should be able to advertise the work within a week to the TAC mailing list. | Daniel: Qt is probably the most complicated dependency, and is typically an optional dependency. Will be a good accomplishment to get that resolved. | Daniel: goal is to make something that is stable and relatively easy to maintain. May need to resource additional build resources (more CPU cores / RAM for instance for builders). Would get build / test results faster. (OpenVDB already asked for that). Dan: yes faster builds are useful, for now relying on multiple builds in parallel. | Aloys: Azure caching and ccache are both useful, but slightly tricky to get working together. | Aloys: Docker caching for image build . | Dan: Travis CI has a great ccache implementation Works best when there’s native support in the CI system . | Azure pipeline caching ccache example: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/caching/?view=azure-devops#ccache-cc | . | Daniel: this is also relevant for project builds. Dave: could help to put in touch with Azure DevOps team to provide expertise. Perhaps could have someone from this team be more directly engaged with ASWF projects. | . | How to deal with secrets vs forks? . | Dan: seems to work with OpenVDB. There’s a toggle in Azure Pipelines setup, there’s an accepted mindset that allowing your fork to access your secret is still better than just having secret being in plaintext since a fork / PR does create some kind of “paper trail” that someone is accessing the secret. Trying to remember how that got done in OpenVDB. Daniel: did that get worked through with lf-releng? Can use existence of secret variable to conditionally execute steps of the build. | Brian: also enable option to share secrets with forks in OpenCue (secret to push to Docker Hub) . | . | . ",

Michael: but you won’t have admin access to the project then, so you have to go through lf-releng to manipulate the Azure Pipelines project. | Daniel: is that working OK? Michael: it’s working pretty well, worked through a few hiccups, lf-releng team is usually pretty responsive, changes happen within a day or two. Would still be useful to have more privileges, for instance can’t kick off manual build the way they used to. | Doug: admin capability could be useful in some cases. Also a bit of a bumpy road getting the DCO / CLA infrastructure in place (on the GitHub side). Had a DCO webhook in place, but turned out it wasn’t correctly integrated with easycla.

Along similar lines as first year: expand membership base, financial stability, Premier Members committed to 2 year tenure, need to make sure ASWF delivers good value. | TAC goals: appetite for expanding project base, TAC is expected to contribute to this process. | . | Survey process (Gordon) . | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYs8RABGS7qFJHvICzj5Jln83MRAZ855WC0qMWq8Vqw/edit . | Last call for input from TAC: end of week to finalize input. At which point send to Governing Board for their additions, then send out to membership. | Any feedback is welcome, but need to make sure we gather actionable data. | Form version from John Mertic: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5MBSTs4SZBABSMQiTu-G_WSnACKGpxVOhPXZgXQUNGnjCSg/formrestricted but not currently accessible . | Daniel: would seem “strange” to not have a list of proposed projects. Larry: if we ask anything about projects they would want “in”, it’s not useful unless they also specify “why” the project should be part of ASWF. Gordon: nice benefit of projects is that their name is unambiguous. So open question is better than a list, doesn’t imply endorsement or arm twisting. Henry: advantage of an actual list is that you can identify trends over time. Likes Larry’s suggestion that there should be a justification as to why someone would want to see a project join ASWF. Eric: isn’t the pitch for ASWF that we make projects more stable / reliable / longer term viable? Cary: agrees with Larry, there must be a realizable benefit to taking the project out of its current state and putting it into ASWF. John: related to this it would be a good idea to communicate how ASWF membership has improved the projects that have joined. | Kimball: also ties in to dependency management, and how many of our dependencies live within the ASWF. | Michael: is there any movement towards publishing the intent and results of the survey. Should have a statement of what will be done with the data, will it be posted publicly? Gordon: will we get less candid feedback if the survey results are posted? Daniel: it should be important to state how the results will be posted. Had discussion with Emily, could be good basis for annual report. | Gordon: added placeholder for the survey intent, and for open list of projects. | . | . | Goals for TAC to end 2019 [0:05-0:15] . | Almost at November, so we have only a few weeks before end of 2019. | Project graduations . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion (wave) . | Wave has been reaching out to a number of organizations, Daniel has been setting up calls . | No specific info to report back for now . | Looking for organizations to partner with, looking for specific information that could be applied to improving our own processes . | A lot of interest in this aspect in the Outreach Committee and Governing Board . | . | Documentation . | Mission statements TAC list . | Proposal from OpenEXR with discussion . | Cary: was present at board meeting where Rob put out this request. | Discussed at TSC, draft by Rob Bogard and Cary, sent draft to Rob Bredow. He gave feedback that it might concentrate more on current state, feedback was incorporated. | What is the real purpose behind the projects, what is the scope (“guardrails”). | Tried to add to the home page, but hard to discuss in isolation of the rest of the information. At the top of the page there will be a description of what the project does, mission statement could be right below that. | Cary: not completely satisfied with the end result, OpenEXR web site itself is up for a major refresh. | Asking for thoughts about how this information should be presented on project page . | Eric: would consider putting the Mission Statement as a separate page linked to by the main menu. Guides what you do and don’t do, different purpose of what you would put on the home page. Cary: also considered putting on a separate page, but feels that Rob thinks that this should be information that is “hard to miss”, and moving that to a separate page might not achieve this goal. | Cary: ideally a Mission Statement should be one or two sentences, but what OpenEXR currently has is a lot more verbose than that. So probably need to go back and try to prune it down. | Daniel: “should be tweetable”, also if we stick to the constraint of a short mission statement it makes it easier to put it in different places. | Cary: 1-2 sentence mission statement summary could link to more detailed page. | Larry: the two paragraphs proposed are a great summary of what the project is about, and do belong at the “top of the page”. Everybody’s README.md should start off with a 1-2 paragraph of what the project is about. Boiling down to the ‘140 character’ version could be a separate task. | Cary: write the mission statement, be thorough and comprehensive, but make sure that if you only read the beginning you still get the gist of it, and you can lift the first 1-2 sentences to provide a summary. | Michael: that can be what you add to other ASWF literature that points to the project. | . | Template project (JF) . | Should the more detailed info go into the Wiki section? . | John: could work on a better organization, offering to help . | . | TAC Project . | Some outstanding PRs that have gone “quiet” . | Create Graduation checklist for projects to use . | Charter Typos . | Create an FAQ for a TSC . | Create Project Success metrics . | Commit numbers? . | Diversity of contributions? . | Frequency / quality of releases? . | Project usage? . | . | Daniel: are we looking for feedback from TAC? . | Should we have a “mission statement” for the tac repo? Who owns it, who is responsible for it? . | John: typically on other foundations those repos are owned by multiple members of the TAC. | John: PRs against the tac repo could generate emails to the tac mailing list? Daniel: this is the first time that PRs have gone idle, so we may not really need more process. For now we can use GitHub mechanisms for drawing attention to PRs. | . | . | VFXPlatform 2020 . | Python 3 | . | CI Progress . | . | Vote: Renew annual term of VES Technical Committee Industry Representative, JF Panisset . | One of 3 Industry Representatives on the TAC . | Informal approval from VES Tech Committee . | Daniel moves to renew JF Panisset as Industry Representative . | Seconded by Kimball . | All ayes, no against, no abstain . | Unanimous renewal . | . | Technical Project updates [0:15-0:30] . | OpenTimelineIO . | Apache license discussion ongoing. | No update from last meeting | . | Some meetings with Avid coming soon. | Meeting with 2 separate Avid people next week, and later discussion in November. | Approval to share some of the technical documentation they provided . | . | Working with TSC on proposed schema improvements. | . | OpenVDB . | OpenCue . | Dave Fellows: no specific updates from 2 weeks ago.

Requirements around reporting and updating public information on reported security vulnerabilities. You post a fix, then make sure the CVE report adds the link back to the fix. | Kimball: make sure you have two factor auth on your GitHub account . | Daniel: we should try to capture this in a way that other projects can use (start with email). | . | Cary: adoption proposal, outlines stats about project activity, CII badge process . | License scan approved by board yesterday, so should be ready for graduation. | Finally set up with EasyCLA system, ready to move repo to ASWF GitHub organization. It seems to be a bit backward to move the project into the GitHub organization before full acceptance? . | Larry had posted message about getting into cadence of patch releases, so discussion of branching strategy to support that. | Constant thorn in their side is Boost / Boost-Python, so looking at replacing Boost-Python with PyBind11 Not a simple project at all. | Getting steady stream of build issue reports, especially on Windows. Doing a reasonable job of keeping up with those reports. | Should be more pro-active to reaching out to distro maintainers, pushing to update to more recent versions. Some distros still include version 1.7, important to update given security-related fixes. | VFX Reference Platform looking at moving to 2.4.0 for Reference Platform 2020. | Going with 2.4.0 instead of 2.3.1 is due to the additional of an API function. | . | . | CI updates [0:30-0:40] . | Access / Roles / Workflow for updates . | Some frustration from projects . | Possibly best handled in an email discussion . | . | Azure best practices . | GPU agents . | . | Update on candidate projects [0:40-0:50] . | Media player | . | Next meeting . | 6 November 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 [0:00-0:10] . | Python 3 / VFX Platform 2020 . | Adopted yearly release cadence: https://lwn.net/Articles/803679/ and https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0602/ . | Python bindings for OpenEXR (Boost Python vs pybind11). Kimball: OpenEXR can compile against both Python 2 and 3.. | Kimball: we should extract the CMake bits into a centralized place to make this easier to share / reuse, demonstrate how best to compile for both approaches . | Daniel: asking Kimball to look at how to abstract this. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Wave not present at this meeting, but more work has been happening since last meeting meeting.. | Emily: spreadsheet outstanding, will be sent after call . | . | Survey process . | Gordon / Kimball: revived survey thread. Gordon: went through comments on proposed document, bigger question is inherent tension between getting clear info on projects people want to see vs not wanting to appear “predatory”. General consensus: instead of listing projects explicitly, allow more free form identification of areas / projects, but include justification information. | Any last comments, or do we feel that we are in position to present to Governing Board. | Kimball: should we ask about other types of projects, should we just “stick to C++ libraries” or branch out? Gordon: at early meetings there was discussions on whether we should be looking at media / datasets as well as code. Daniel: anticipate that this will come up in feedback, our response so far has been somewhat inconclusive on this topic. Perhaps we should have a clear answer as to what we see the scope of ASWF. Gordon: we’ve mostly avoided answering that question so far. Daniel: we need to be clear as to what we’re going to do with the data from the survey. Kimball: should we be trying to foster projects such as improving the “social” aspect of the industry (“sharing Nuke scripts” for instance, Python snippets…). Gordon: an “eclectic set of ideas”. There is a section asking “what do you want to see the ASWF focus on next year”? Maybe we could have a set of suggestions. John: might as well keep doing this in the Word document, and will get translated to survey form. | Daniel: last call for last minute comments! . | . | . | Thread Pools / Tbb (Larry) [0:10-0:25] . | TAC-list thread . | Larry: there was an offlist discussion started by SideFX folks, interactions between thread pools in Houdini, OpenIMageIO, OpenVDB… . | Specific problem on Windows: on app shutdown it terminates the threads before calling static destructors, leading to deadlocks in threadpools, is there a way to cleanly shutdown every threadpool. | For each of these libraries / apps, they design their thread strategies in isolation, assuming they are the only thread pool in the process address space. This is no longer the case, if you have 8 libraries that each try to use all 16 cores on a system, you now have 128 threads… . | ASWF TAC can provide a forum to “corral the chaos”, what are best practices. | For many of the apps, they have already settled on TBB, so non-TBB apps / libraries need to be at least aware of this. | OpenEXR has an ability to override use of its own thread pool and allow the app to provide thread pool control. | Even if all we ended up with was basic guidance on how apps / libraries should set up thread pools. In some cases just using TBB might be the best approach, or the app could provide its own interface to TBB. | Daniel: extensive feedback on mailing list shows there’s an appetite for this. | Daniel: at what level should an abstraction live in order to be safe and effective. It’s trivial to have a naive thread pool, but specific behavior of specific thread pools can be useful / important. A naive abstraction may be under specified. | Larry: agreed. There is a safety and quality issue. Easy to write a thread pool infrastructure with subtle problems. Useful to discourage people from writing their own. | Sean: looking into getting a threading expert from TBB group, but wasn’t able to do this on short notice. | Sean / Dan: in theory different versions of TBB should be interoperable, but in practice if you mix different TBB versions, that can lead to crashes. | Larry: in theory everyone should stick to TBB version from Reference Platform. | Gordon: TBB offered promise of forward / backward compatibility. Would be great to get the current perspective from Intel expert / TBB team, is this something we can rely on, or should we not assume this is the case. | Daniel: asking Kimball if they had issues with forward or backward compatibility? Kimball: was compiling against newer version, Katana was loading earlier version, was getting crashes deep in thread affinity code. | Patrick: another perspective, let the host (DCC) manage the threads so the library only guaranteed to be thread safe. “Apply” in OpenColorIO, host can call this method in different threads, library guarantees that this work. Let the one having all the knowledge (the DCC) manage the threads. | Gordon: that helps for a simple library, the challenge is when you have a complex library (threaded USD composition for instance) it gets problematic. | Chris reporting better performance from threading outside of TBB. | Larry: would be interested in investigating this. So far has only heard this report once. | Gordon: for a embarassingly parallel problem you might always be able to come up with an application-specific threading model which is slightly more efficient. | Kimball: trying to move towards a fully stateless model where OpenEXR wouldn’t do threading. | Daniel: also different considerations for I/O parallelism . | Kimball: will keep utility functionality to provide a default threading implementation for naive callers . | Dan: from the VDB perspective, they use TBB heavily, preferred solution, if you are building the TBB plugin, you are using the TBB version used by that version of Houdini. Seems like a reliable way to use TBB. Hard to see how you could create an abstraction layer on top of TBB since OpenVDB uses so much of TBB. But one area which is interesting is that it would be interesting to be able to compile OpenVDB against fewer dependencies, and TBB is currently a required dependency. Would it be possible to compile VDB against a simpler subset? If we were to create an ASWF library on top of TBB, that would not just really be solving any problems. | Daniel: embree has internal thread implementation which you can use instead of TBB. | Sean: set up as a compile flag. | Daniel: non trivial task of capturing all the points of view, also deeper discussion with Intel. Should this be done as a sub group. Larry: is it worth setting up a separate list to discuss this? Probably not worth separate meetings. For instance OpenEXR, OpenImageIO and SideFX already have a conversation going. Gordon: this is a “task force” model, Autodesk would be interested in joining this discussion since they consume a lot of these APIs. | Dan: would be good to try using TBB for OpenEXR / OpenImageIO, happy to contribute expertise. Larry: at few years ago took a look at TBB for OpenImageIO, seemed like a large dependency, and dual licensing seemed complicated. Also came from a single vendor (Intel), would it only work on certain CPUs / OSes. So “rolled his own”, but has nothing against TBB, license has been cleared up, it’s a real open source project, and OpenImageIO is already indirectly dependant on TBB since it is dependant on OpenVDB. So has no issue with using TBB. | Daniel: good area for TAC to work on. | Gordon: Autodesk has threading experts, can they join the discussion? Yes, TAC list is open. Larry: bring anyone else who is interested as well. | . | Graduation guidelines — committers vs contributors (Brian) . | https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/102#discussion_r338553385 . | Current graduation guidelines only mentions “committers”, should we clarify what is meant by committers / contributors. | Daniel: having a “diverse range of committers” is a stricter requirement than “a diverse range of contributors”. | What does “a healthy number” really mean? Is the vagueness intentional? . | Larry: committers just means “the people who have the permission to hit the merge button” in GitHub. Depending on project policy, having many people allowed to merge is not necessarily better (although need to adhere to the “bus rule”, can’t just be one). | Dave: number of organizations contributing is also an important metric. | John: concern you are trying to prevent is having a project controlled by a single organization, where if the organization walks away the project collapses. | Commiter tends to be someone more deeply involved in the project. If you have 10 committers across 5 organizations, 2 organizations can walk away and the project still survives. What about committers vs TSC? . | Daniel: will suggest a “path to solution” with an update to the PR: say “each of those things is important”. | Brian: template charter says “TSC can supercede committers”, but maybe there should be explicit language defining how to decide who gets to be committer. | Andrew: TSC is final arbiter of committers on most projects. But a particular project wants to propose a committer, that proposal is usually made by a current committer, discussion in the open between current committers, then proposal brought to TSC. In OpenDaylight community in 6 years the TSC denied committer rights only 3 times, was usually based on the proposed committer having never actually contributed code. Overall policy is defined by the TSC. The TAC can give guidance, but the TSC for a particular project has that right / responsibility. | Brian: immediate concern is clarifying graduation process. Happy to take a stab at updating John’s PR or the original graduation requirements document. Daniel: can have further discussion on GitHub, will discuss at next TAC meeting. | . | Technical Project updates [0:30-0:45] . | OpenVDB . | Dan: Approaching new 7.0 major version, by end of month, part of VFX Platform 2020. Bump compiler to C++14. Still discussing minimum CMake version, any consensus from other projects? Larry: what versions are being debated? Dan: minimum is 3.8, looking to move to 3.11 or 3.12. Larry: bumped OSL / OpenImageIO to 3.12. Dan: tried to maintain compatibility for a few years in the past. Kimball: Ubuntu 18 is still at 3.10, but 3.12 has some really nice features. Patrick: OpenColorIO recently moved from 3.10 to 3.11 due to a Windows specific issue. | Daniel: a good issue to discuss. Good discussion to have on the list. | . | OpenColorIO . | GPU . | Doug: V2 is progressing well, Patrick just upgraded to latest YAML version, OCIO had been stuck on old version of YAML library. On CI front we’ve had CI process go down a couple of times due to changes in Azure macOS build agent. Any way to get notified of those changes in advance. Was able to address within a week, but long term would like more control over the agents. | Have been working with Andy for GPU support, no current support for dynamic agents, an issue but not a blocker. Andy: we can stand up GPU instances, they would be static instances (running full time). Had heard from Microsoft about plans to roll out dynamic build instances, but haven’t heard anything about progress for a while. Same for discussions for GitHub Actions, that functionality not available until next year. We could move forward with static build instances, instances are computing resources / money full time. Does ASWF want to spend money on what could potentially be idle instances. | . | OpenEXR . | Graduation | . | OpenCue . | OpenTimelineIO . | Avid involvement | . | . | CI updates . | Working group . | OpenVDB artifacts in Nexus repo: still needed? . | Is there a problem with maintaining Nexus repo after standing down Jenkins infrastructure. | Andy: if we’re not going to keep updating artifacts we should move them somewhere else. | Artifactory Cloud is available for free for open source service. | Was an available location for large binary distributions. | Andy: for relatively static objects could be done as AWS S3 buckets . | Dan: would be happy to move this to another location. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Media Player | . | Next meeting . | 20 November 2019 | . | .

Sean just needs to be given an account to provide credits. Discussing DevOps workflows for forks of projects, other projects that may not map directly to ASWF workflows.

Aloys: using the full suite of caching functionality provided by Azure Pipelines (still in beta / preview state). Create a cache key, list of fallback keys, using for ccache. Will work with JF to add simple example / support in ASWF sample project, will benefit other projects to reuse results of previous builds via ccache.

Has been interacting with Andrew Grimberg to make use of AWS GPU instances, but stopped by lack of dynamic provisioning. | Still, keep adding more GPU tests all the time, eager to be able to run them. | Larry: current holdup is not able to dynamically get GPU instances. | Andrew: no dynamic builds in Azure Pipeline is true. We can stand up static instances and incur ongoing costs of keeping those instances running, or we wait until Microsoft adds support for dynamic provisioning. Unless chained builds actually work out. Will come down to how the community / ASWF wants to spend the money. | Larry: do we have an idea of how much we are talking about? Andrew: depends on number and size of instances. Larry: having an order of magnitude would help. Andrew: needs to know the size of instances needed. Daniel: we can provide this information now. Doug: looking for specific machine on AWS we would like to use? Andrew: AWS or Azure, want size of instance / instances. Doug: our goal is to start with one, minimal GPU requirement. | JF: will provide “cheapest” instances info. | Daniel: by default Azure Pipelines doesn’t offer dynamic provisioning, but allows external build agents added to a pool. We could use this to “cook up” our own dynamic provisioning system. Andrew: there would also have to be a step afterwards to clean up, otherwise would end up with a lot of orphan nodes. This is an issue they run into in OpenStack. Daniel: is this a problem that others are facing? Andrew: none of the other LF projects are currently doing this on Azure Pipelines, sounds similar to something they did on OpenStack, do multi-node testing, lead node connected to Jenkins would then instantiate all the other nodes it needs, then clean up after itself. Another job then looks for orphan nodes and cleans those up to avoid running up costs. Can point to work done in JJB but not clear if that would translate over to Azure Pipelines. Daniel: we should make sure to leverage Azure contacts at Microsoft. Get indication of roadmap for dynamic instances. Andrew: had heard it was a goal before end of year, but the year is running out… . | Aloys: if we get price of small GPU instance and we keep one instance always on running for 3 / 6 months, would this be feasible? Andrew: yes, we could go with something like that. Daniel / Sean: AWS offer of resources based on “responsible” use of resources, we want to leave headroom for later, and architecturally it’s a good idea to have an elastic worker pool that expands / contracts based on demand is the right way to go. | Daniel: if the cost of an instance is minimal this may be a practical step to get things going. | Doug: nothing else to report right now, had some problems with macOS agent, some updates broke the builds, but no such problems this week. Otherwise nothing else to report. Daniel: as the group most active across platforms, do you have a sense of how useful it would be to move to a more consistent (Docker?) approach across platforms? Doug: can’t comment right now, testing a variety of configurations, would be nice to tie more directly into work done by JF / Aloys, but can’t really speak to the challenges for OCIO. | Sean: is the ultimate goal to be running all our testing in Docker? Daniel: the goal is to provide the right way to capture as much of the dependency infrastructure, with desirable goal to reuse in other contexts. We started out by trying to use a much more open CI approach (Jenkins / LF JJB), we switched to trying to use reusability more internal, using Azure Pipelines, with a Docker image based build environment. | Aloys: we have a CI-base Docker image that contains all upstream requirements (Boost, TBB, …) aligned with VFX Reference Platform version, then additional images for each ASWF project. Just added a CI-USD for all the upstream dependencies for USD, hoping to submit PR to USD project to use that build image. Bonus CI-VFXall image that has everything included, including Qt, “everything and the kitchen sink”, not a lightweight Docker instance or fast to pull, but very convenient. Receiving a lot of Qt 5.12 builds of Houdini / Maya, and those Qt builds are not ABI compatible, hoping to propose this build image as a reference that could potentially be used by vendors as well. Daniel: we wanted our CI infrastructure to be exactly that, something that can be used for VFX Reference Platform builds. | . | OpenEXR . | Daniel: Some discussion about Python 3 happened at last TAC meeting, Kimball offered to follow up with quick pointer as to who they are currently managing concurrent Python 2 and 3 builds in their CMake configuration, could be useful for other projects. Has not happened yet. | Larry: nothing specific to add. CMake files are relatively readable, but will change with transition to pybind11, top of list for upcoming 2.5 release. | . | OpenVDB . | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2019 . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion (Wave, Emily) . | Look within your organization to see if there’s someone that doesn’t look like you that could be your replacement or tag team member on the TAC. If that person is unavailable, ask them for referrals/suggestions. | Please take a look at this google doc and see if you have any personal contacts there (look at the board of advisors or leaders, also consider members). If so, please reach out individually and see if they have any suggestions/connections for us. Could be opportunities to present what ASWF is, what kinds of contributions folks could do (familiarize with our projects, pull requests, associate membership, etc.) . | https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XxH3hIsk1K3GDAZymF8emh8AWF3T_1bLf32_EXKSiE0/edit#gid=1665706912 | . | . | VFXPlatform 2020 / Python 3 . | GPU support in CI (OCIO) . | Proof of concept commitment | . | Developer Engagement (Emily) - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MMUNxJl6sbpMQmIDAfjZ52lUP08mA16JY6AZwYFtGdM/edit?usp=sharing . | Putting together 2020 goals, increasing developer engagement and participation, cannot be developed in a silo. Should be led by the TAC, so need to present the slides so we can decide on priorities. | Seminars, meetups, developer days (hosted day of sessions, deep dives into projects, in cities with sizable developer community), use cases and case studies, written tutorials and technical blog posts . | Wave: all looks good, for the ones that are presentations, would be good to have a consistent “one slide” on how to contribute to ASWF projects. Agreed upon messaging. Emily: good idea, have existing “how to contribute” at high level, but need more developer focussed. Wave: may have a mix of technical artists and developers, target towards skills of people who show up (C++, Python, …). Different opportunities for people to engage. Daniel: past discussions have highlighted opportunities for a broad engagement, as well as encouraging skilled developers who are already using our projects to contribute directly to our projects. | Daniel: asking projects where our focus should be, “best bang for the buck” to get best return on effort. | Wave: similar to “every project should have mission statement”, every project should also have a “how to engage with our project” explicit statement / document. Sean: do we want to make a distinction between internal developers in organizations who may not be able to commit to public repos vs external developers who have no such constraints? Wave: if you have code you have written that is locked up in our organization, having a “how to contribute” document helps to evangelize contributing back. Sean: should try to help non member organizations to contribute back. Larry: if people are having that issue in that organization, “bottom up” approach is unlikely to work. Top down may have better results, apply pressure at the executive level. More appropriate to the governing board. | Executive-level testimonials from existing organizations may be more convincing to outside organizations. | Larry: rather than outreach, “inreach” may be better, low hanging fruit are people already in organizations participating in projects / member organizations. Wave: simple, specific talking points to share within organization are helpful. Especially in large companies many potential contributors don’t know about ASWF, even when their company is a member. | Cary: generic, non-domain specific expertise can be quite useful. CMake for instance is not OpenEXR specific, but uses up a lot of time from OpenEXR contributors. Similarly for website, documentation. Not clear where to go for that expertise / contribution. Need more than just a “casual dalliance”, need specific commitment. | Emily: other LF projects have hired someone specifically to do documentation. Should raise this with governing board to hire contractor. | Daniel: expertise in non domain specific expertise could be found within our member companies. Wave: reaching out to a DevOps company as an associated member company could be interested. Emily: we could create a working group for some of those topics, provides a path for people to get involved in those activities. | Emily: providing a toolkit / format to internally advance and inform within their own organization. Is this something to do in person (“brown bag lunch sessions”?). Larry: people on the governing board, TAC, TSCs are senior in their organizations, as a group we need to go back to our organizations, identify junior developers and get them involved. | Daniel: hopefully that provides some points to work with. | Emily: priority should be to provide tools for internal evangelism, and provide talking points to demonstrate value of project involvement. | . | . | ASWF Annual Report (Emily) . | Project chairs - please take a look at the stats we would like to include for each project. | Stats due by Nov. 29 if possible. | Report outline: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yHB0AggIHwD6P-fhyQh9B5dJ_9QwiuBpP0ESQiVcpA4/edit?usp=sharing” . | Look back at year so far, use CNCF as a template. | Want to show impact of each project, number of contributors, key contributing companies, number of software releases. Will incorporate into infographics. | Will also include mission statements. | . | Follow ups . | ASWF Org and Project permissions and workflows (Andy) . | Responses sent as a private email thread . | Should move thread to public list . | Done: Thread | . | How we can deal with permissions and workflows across GitHub, DockerHub, Azure, SonarCloud… . | How do we grant rights, who gets what kind of administrator rights, at what level . | Andy: LF releng can hand over some administrative duties to some projects, but leery of doing it, historically have had issues with shared administration. Not to say LF releng won’t do it, as long as there is clear guidance on who has access to administrative rights, and what they are allowed to do. | How do projects get contributors up to have committer rights (approve PRs): . | LF releng has developed automated method for adding / removing contributors, top level info.yml file in repo controls it. That change requires quorum of current contributors, once it is merged it gets shadowed into a releng repo, gets reviewed, then automatically updates the GitHub repo positions. | Or GitHub has a MAINTAINERS file, no quorum based voting, easier to get someone in a committer status, only current mechanism is gatekeeper for adding to the MAINTAINERS. | . | Discussion about how projects go about “protecting” merges. Andy: Recommendation to have “hard” rather than “soft” rules, easier to avoid bypassing rules, easier for maintainer to push back on bending the rules. | If a project wants to go with “soft” rules, LF releng won’t object, but that is not the recommendation. | On the Azure Pipelines side, have been experimenting with permissions, since billing goes through LF, permissions go through Azure Active Directory. So can invite people into the LF organization without having to have them be actual members of the organization, and grant them specific rights to do what they need to do. Permission model in Azure Pipelines/DevOps is extensive (huge!), so may require some experimentation. | Daniel: LF releng has experience across many projects / foundations, should find the model that has worked elsewhere and fits our requirements best. | . | Survey for 2020 Goals (Emily, Gordon) . | Draft: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5MBSTs4SZBABSMQiTu-G_WSnACKGpxVOhPXZgXQUNGnjCSg/viewform . | Initially targeting board members, but feel it’s important for TAC and TSC members to also respond. | Based on feedback from TAC members, turned into a Google form. | Please provide feedback, don’t necessarily want to add too much . | Would like to get this out ahead of next week’s board meeting . | Daniel: thank you to Gordon for pushing this initiative forward. | . | Thread library (Larry) . | Good example of cross project leveraging, what the ASWF can provide as a forum to enable conversations around industry needs. | Daniel: 3 good examples: dependency management / CMake, thread library, OpenEXR math library . | Larry: should be sending summary, plan is to keep the conversation going. Won’t be a “one size fits all” solution, but will try to “tame the chaos”. | Daniel: was at SIGGRAPH Asia with people from USD and SideFX team, one of the main topics was abstraction used by USD / SideFX to address threading. Larry: any collateral available? Daniel: they promised that slides should be shared, will follow up. | Sean: reached out to TBB architect, he’s signing up to TAC mailing list, will respond there (Alexei Kukanov). | . | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB . | OpenColorIO . | OpenEXR . | Repo naming conventions / requirements (lowercase only?) . | Cary: upper case vs lower case? Hoping to move OpenEXR repo into ASWF GitHub organization this afternoon, we had a preference for CamelCase, but hot a strong performance. | Is that restriction a sensible thing that makes sense going forward? Is this a time to clean up this legacy? . | Andy: LF releng position is that CamelCase repo names causes problems with their tooling when cloning repos. | Larry: problem isn’t necessarily with the LF tooling, but Windows / Mac that has case preserving but not case sensitive filesystems (mostly on Windows, for repos that started on Linux). | Andy: creates a support burden when onboarding projects. Not to say LF releng won’t support CamelCase named projects. | Daniel: would it make sense to recognize that our projects already predominantly use CamelCase repo names, that if we decide to go to lowercase repo names we should do that across all our projects at the same time. So go with CamelCase with OpenEXR for now, but we can look at implications of moving all projects to lowercase going forward. | Andy: LF releng has run into issue where issues with specific repos generated a lot of support requests. | Cary: given broad use of OpenEXR, have steady stream of build related issues, testament to how widely it is used. So would like to remove that as an issue and go with lowercase. | Cary: it’s never been an issue because current repo name is lowercase. | Cary: this doesn’t apply to organization name? Andy: correct, since that doesn’t end up in your path. | What about multiple related repos, “openexr”, “images”, “viewers”. Those will all exist as a flat repo hierarchy under AcademySoftwareFoundation. Larry: OpenColorIO will be like that as well. Cary: each repo needs infrastructure (license file, README, …). Some minimal amount of infrastructure that points back to the main repo. | . | OpenCue . | Update on OpenCue meetup last week at Sony Imageworks, was in context of LA pipeline developers Meetup group. | 2 people from Imageworks, 2 people from OpenCue. | Around 30-40 people attended, small enough to make it interactive, technical enough to be able to go in depth. | Recorded, should be publishing soon. | Will try to do more in the future, was quite successful. | LA Pipeline meetup would be open to other topic suggestions for future meetings. | Sean: is there value in having a suite of presentations “cued up” for our projects, for other events, conferences. Emily: yes, having a “Meetup” toolkit would be useful, have a “standard deck” per project. Relies on each project to put together such a deck. Daniel: there is such a deck for the ASWF and the TAC (presented most recently at SIGGRAPH Asia). Emily will send link. But should have more specific TSC-level decks for each project. Sean: we should take advantage of the high profile of some of our contributors to draw interest into our projects. | . | OpenTimelineIO . | Having regular tech-focused calls with Avid (informal working group) . | Designated contact for AAF technical details, unlocked some blockers about that technology, had 8 people on call this morning. | . | Legal conversation around modified Apache is making some progress . | Email thread, currently using modified Apache, Disney wants to keep that modification, project would like to move to unmodified. | Legal folks are finding a compromise that will hopefully get this unblocked. | . | Beginning to talk with TSC about mission statement for OTIO . | . | . | CI updates . | Working group | . | Update on candidate projects . | Media Player? | . | Next meeting . | 4 December 2019 | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2019 . | GPU enabled CI Proof of concept | VFX Platform 2020 / Python 3 | . | Follow ups . | Threading library / best practices . | Larry: tricky situation, needs of the projects are varied, OpenEXR on one of the scale where they use internal / home grown thread library, make things easy for applications by adding a public API call that lets calling application provide its own threading library. Other end is OpenVDB that uses Intel TBB so deeply that it would be very difficult to replace it. So seems unlikely to find a solution that would span the range of needs. Some people in isolation express misgivings on using TBB as the solution, but we don’t want to encourage home grown solutions, and encouraging TBB is probably currently the best approach. Maybe we can get some help from Intel to help deal with expressed issues, also room for establishing best practices, for instance how do we deal with an ecosystem of libraries that all want to use multithreading independently of each other. | Gordon: can you elaborate about concerns about TBB? Larry: don’t know that there are real issues, “median” opinion is that TBB is a pretty good solution, we should track down the “outliers” who have concerns. Could also be based on experience from years ago. | Kimball: may have been the one claiming an issue, experience is mostly about mixing versions of TBB, for instance a plugin compiled with a different version of TBB than the main application. Seems to mostly work, but can end up with random crashes at exit. | Sean: have had issues with initialization of MPP, proprietary schedulers and usage of task arenas, when you have multiple libraries who might try to initialize TBB in different orders. But overall think it’s a good idea to encourage use of TBB, with some best practices. | Larry: unless you have a good reason not to, should encourage using TBB. OpenVDB won’t have needs satisfied unless entirety of TBB. | Sean: USD may bring similar needs. | Daniel: Pixar have a wrapper around TBB, but it’s “leaky” (libwork in USD), served the purpose of providing an easy place to consistently restricting the number of threads. That’s apparently less of an issue in current TBB versions. Concerns about mixing multiple clients (maximum consistency) vs being able to control the threading system. | Daniel: can we draw any useful / simplified conclusion? Sounds like a direct opportunity to articulate challenges that people meet, and make it easy for people to use TBB in multiple libraries. Maybe adding some kind of standard layer / shim library, and/or provide feedback to Intel to make things easier. Sean has already suggest that TBB team is eager to get our feedback. | Sean: forwarded Larry email to TBB architect, team is in Russia, they are interested in engaging with us. | . | GPU CI . | Work on costing (JF) -&gt; cannot use K80 instances for OpenGL, need GRID license | Need to look at preemptible instances | Larry: although today’s development of OCIO is primarily interested in testing against OpenGL, going forward is probably going to run CUDA code paths. | Sean: scalability might be an issue, as we expand GPU need into other projects. Also do we want to expose this testing pool to forks of our projects. How widely do we want to make this mechanism available to our developers. | Larry: expanding to expand to PRs seems like a core requirement. | Michael: it’s not like there are dozens of PRs coming in. | John: is concern mostly about cost? Sean: could be premature optimization. John: there are different ways to handle cost issues. | JF: Could also use Software OpenGL in some cases (example of DJV): Michael: OCIO test suite known to fail on software OpenGL implementation. | Eric: are projects interested in a range of GPUs or drivers? Testing on multiple / simultaneous GPUs? | Michael: platform differences can be crucial | Daniel: do we have enough info to generate formal resource request to board or one of our members? One machine is a tractable amount of money, 10 machines would be a lot more. Do we have enough of a concrete use case to “turn things on” now? OCIO project: how urgently do you want this? | Michael: targeting OCIO v2 for next summer, so would be useful to get it going. Doug: don’t get GPU-related PRs every day, a few minor changes every other week. But would like to put in place for the project. | Daniel: will follow up with Dave about support for dynamic instances on Azure. JF: will pick up discussion thread with Azure Pipelines team. | Sean: not so concerned about cost optimization, willing to cover the cost, but dynamic instances could be interesting for scalability concerns (especially if builds start to queue up). | Wave: has been investigating availability of macOS build resources. Shipping of new MacPro later this month may help. JF: will be looking at Orka on MacStadium. | Wave: on Mac Mini hardware, only Intel integrated graphics is available. The restrictions about the number of instances of macOS you can run is a business rather than a technical issue. | . | Surveys . | Daniel: member survey is making the rounds, Emily sent reminder. Emily: trying to finalize the survey, will share results soon. | . | . | Python 3 . | Working group to share studio expertise? | Provide good examples of how to transition different types of code bases | Binding generation (pybind11) | OpenEXR is in process of tackling this issue, Kimball working on CMake changes to allow Python 2.7 and Python 3 to both be built alongside. | Other projects in good shape, but want updates from individual projects. | OpenTimelineIO: differences between Python 2.7 and 3 haven’t been much of an issue, except for some small Unicode issues. More issues about packaging and package management, so could use some help from the wider community. | OCIO: not there yet, in the process of writing new bindings with pybind11 which will give dual version support, 30% of the way done, should be done in a couple of months. | Cary: Python bindings for imath, already building for 2.7 and 3, plan to rewrite bindings with pybind11. | Gordon: Is there a general model that we should suggest how to do this? Struggling for a good model for Maya. Goal is to get a beta out, but depend on a number of libraries, if all the libraries choose “can only build one at a time” vs “can build in parallel” has an effect. | Kimball: assuming that for OpenEXR need to assuming that both versions need to be supported for a while to ensure transition. But OpenEXR is pretty simple. Kimball: can build in same build, but will generate separate DSOs. | Kimball: need more work your CMake files to support building and packaging 2.7 and 3 in the same build, but fairly transparent where stuff ends. | Josh: also using CMake / pybind11, but overall developer instructions have flaws, also issues when pushing to PyPI. Would really like to know “how to reach out to”. | Daniel: should we create a working group on the Python 3 topic? Would Josh like to lead this? Josh: yes, but would have to start next year. Daniel: deep in this process at Animal Logic, keen to share knowledge and learn from others. | Daniel: we should try to collect and gather efforts and resources. | Larry: Gordon, don’t hesitate to communicate with packages that Maya is waiting for movement on Python 3. Gordon: will get the Maya Python 3 lead to join the group. Larry: some library owners may not realize that their library is in the dependency tree of Maya. | Daniel: when you analyze upstream dependencies, sometimes it’s not clear there is a Python 3 equivalent of a library. | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB | OpenColorIO . | Already discussed GPU / Python 3 | Trying to start up more formal discussion with ACES, trying to clear up licensing on ACES-related code (aces-ocio config is used by many studios) | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: repo was moved to ASWF GitHub organization 3 weeks ago, locked out of submitting PRs due to EasyCLA system. Was reporting that Cary’s company didn’t have a CLA on file, problem was just identified (LucasFilm vs ILM), so problem resolved now. Something to watch out for, need to watch out with dependent company names. | Daniel: had similar issues with some other transitions. What can we do to make things more obvious. | Cary: the ASWF can help with this, should be a more familiar issue if it comes up again. | JF: EasyCLA system works well but is a bit intimidating. John: has heard similar feedback from other contributors. | Larry: important that “CLA Manager” be clearly designated, and close to the project. | . | OpenCue . | Focussed on finishing up Python 3 work, should be done mid next week, every component but 1 has been migrated. Futurize tool did 90% of the work. Not so much in terms of packaging issues though. | . | OpenTimelineIO . | No specific updates | . | . | CI updates . | Working group | . | Update on candidate projects . | Media player | . | Dev Analytics preview ( https://lfanalytics.io/projects/academy-software-foundation ) . | John: goal is to showcase some of the analytics around or projects, more than the basic ones provided by GitHub. Answer higher level questions. Early stages of how do we pull this together. Currently pulling GitHub and Slack. Company Contributor stats currently wrong, being worked on. | Commit growth, number of commits, can break down based on contributors and organizations. Over time will be able to pull in communications info (Slack, mailing lists). | Caveat: “in beta” really should be “in alpha”, asking for feedback. Also “what are the bigger picture questions you want to answer about your project”. | JF: should this be extended to other systems in the ASWF landscape? Or at least some important ones? | Josh: could be interesting to look at stats across projects (are projects siloed vs contributing to multiple projects). John: would be useful to have insight across projects. | Brian: is this pulling in multiple repos for individual projects? John: yes, multiple Slack channels as well. | Feedback via TAC list is good. | . | Next meeting . | December 18 2019? | . | . ",

Heard today about requirements for a successful Working Group. | John: happy to help with setting up structure of goal, timeline, deliverables. Can come up with a candidate proposal. | Daniel: is there anyone willing to volunteer to lead this process? | Gordon: may be easier to find a leader once we’ve defined the goals. | Daniel: does anyone have experience to share across our projects? Some interesting questions raised on TAC list, specifically transition to pybind11. | Will there be cross pollination with the VFX Reference Platform group? Daniel: yes. | JF is liaison with VFX Technology Committee. | Wave: is there a notion of the deliverable of this group? Is it guidelines, code, best practices? Daniel: that sounds like the agenda of a first meeting. | . | Documentation . | Daniel, Project visibility at a high level, but also a useful resource for active and incoming developers. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Useful discussions during earlier session, need to do work to summarize those results | . | Developer Engagement | Priority Discussion on Working Groups . | Gordon: we talked about a number of other Working Groups today, would be useful to come up with a more formal list, prioritize the work, where do we have the energy / resources / knowledge. | Wave: USD is not an “actionable topic”, need specific action items. Under the heading of “USD” need specific ideas. | Gordon: do we need to have these Working Group approved by the Governing Board? John: not needed, unless there’s budgetary approval required. The TAC has the authority to decide what it wants to work on. | We need to determine what constitutes a Working Group. Part of the issue with USD is that it belongs to Pixar, and may not have the desire to give up control (but OTIO is counter example). John: there may be an opportunity to have something similar to the Project Lifecycle Document for Working Groups (not as much depth). | Daniel: there may be 2 categories. One is a clear area of interest for the TAC, the other is more aspirational about reaching some of our long term goals. Cost is low for a Working Group, don’t want to take it too lightly, but want to take advantage of energy and enthusiasm. | Gordon: would it be interesting to set a goal for next meeting to have a list of possible Working Groups, create some proposals, and have a vote? It can be hard to come up with that list just in a meeting. | John: can work to produce a lightweight document for Working Group lifecycle. Typically an idea for a Working Group needs a champion behind it. | . | . | Google Summer of Code (Larry) [0:20-0:30] . | https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/master/gsoc/README.md | Larry: have taken on the work of the application process, describing our organization, pointers to our resources, submitted yesterday. | Saw PR feedback today (https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/119 – https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/tree/master/gsoc), landing page where students end up with a list of potential projects. Feb 5 is the deadline. | Bottom section of the page are placeholders for each of the member projects, would like to see 3-5 ideas per project for summer student projects. Need a mentor for each project. Also list any special skills required. | Larry: TSC chairs please submit PRs with ideas for their individual projects. | Feb 20 is when Google announces which projects are accepted into the program. | Previous experience is that this dramatically increases the exposure of a project. Students might propose their own ideas as well. | Left a slot to allow flexibility to suggest ASWF members or students to suggest cross-project idea, or an idea that falls outside our own projects, for instance integrating one of our projects into an external open source project. | . | CI updates [0:30-0:40] . | Working group . | Haven’t had working group meeting since last TAC meeting, so no specific new activities to report. | But good time to discuss what direction we might want to steer the CI working group | Model has been a long running group, but with periodic goal review. | We targeted GPU as an important requested feature, work by JF to build a prototype to build that support. | Still waiting on support to dynamically manage a pool of resources | Andrew: there has been pushback on static deployment of a GPU instance, so LF RelEng doesn’t currently manage static instances. Had call with GitHub Actions team today, roadmap for dynamic build capabilities at the end of this quarter. Not clear if that will also translate to Azure Pipelines. GitHub may be able to give access to larger instances than the default, with the caveat of perhaps longer latency for access to those instances. That may not be an issue for our types of projects. | Daniel: use case was OCIO, asking Michael what would be the requirements from OCIO? | Michael: can run tests locally, but the goal is to be able to do it “in the cloud”, it’s a critical piece of OCIO, especially with working happening on OCIO v2. Need help on the Azure side, as far as GitHub Actions it looks fairly similar to Azure Pipelines, so could potentially try that. | John: sounds like there are instances outside of Azure Pipelines? Andrew: Offer is credits from AWS, but billing can be complicated, primary issue is that it is a managed instance of a flavor that LF releng doesn’t currently support. | Daniel: sounds like we may need to take this issue offline (next wednesday CI meeting), so may need to forward with standing up instances dynamically. | Daniel: ideally CI environment should be a component of the Python 3 transition, some projects have managed to set up a dual Python 2 / 3 testing environment. OpenEXR went for approach where you can build Python 2 and 3 bindings, parallel availability of Python versions. | Larry: is that extra work something that we want to support / recommend? For OIIO it supports one or the other. | Gordon: sounds like a good question for the Python 3 Working Group! | Daniel: how do large DCC applications manage this? | . | . | Update on candidate projects [0:40-0:50] . | Gordon: ideas for projects to bring into ASWF, or work projects for ourselves? | Daniel: specific candidate projects as Rez. Some of what came from survey: . | Rez: Alan is still interested to move project towards adoption, has opened up contribution process, wider group of people involved in maintenance. Is a Working Group a good way to guide this project further? . | Larry: anyone concerned with Rez licensing? LGPL 3 (licensing migration topic was discussed). | LGPL may be just as difficult as GPL to push through a studio legal organization. | John: will follow up. | . | USD: top of the survey. | Gordon: the message is that we’re not trying to be predatory. We’re not trying to “acquire” external projects, in this case just help. | . | Media player (discussed in previous TAC meeting) . | DJV, some work to integrate with OTIO | Why is this an area of perceived need, especially if there isn’t a clear candidate | . | John: we had slowdown in submissions to the Landscape project, so if we spot any missing projects, please engage the maintainers to submit. Also trying to transfer the opensourcevfx.org domain to point to this. | . | . | Additional Topics . | We moved away from having predefined slots for our projects, but anyone is free to add topics from the projects. For example Cary asked about help on defining the scope of where OpenEXR should go (was somewhat of a rhetorical device to state the goals of the OpenEXR project). | Gordon: some amount of funding was applied to CI last year, but we should discuss if that’s what we want to do this year. A clear list of tasks for each projects (or across projects) helps to define our priorities and where funds could be applied. | Daniel: OCIO has been effective at defining a clear roadmap, good first issues, where resources are needed. Michael: we had discussed creating a web page to freely explore project needs. OCIO has created “First Issue” tags on GitHub (relevant for Google Summer of Code). But some of the issues are rather big. Tagging is good, but a landing page would be useful as well. | John: main page on TAC repo is to use a badging system, including a Good First Issue tag. https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/ | Michael: somewhere where projects can summarize bigger needs, digging through GitHub issues can be cumbersome. | John: standard tag scheme for projects might help. JF: needs to be documented in template project. | Daniel: reporting and accounting of engineering resources. | Cary: what about security? That was discussed a fair amount early on, OpenEXR feels they’ve gotten to a “good place”, but it seems the topic has fallen off the radar. Also Larey reminded splitting imath as a separate project from OpenEXR: still very much thinking about this, several components to this: . | Straightforward modernization of the code | Mechanics of moving code to a new repo without losing history | How do you motivate doing this kind of work when it’s “not your day job” | Would be good for projects to state that they would want to use imath separate from OpenEXR as a clear use case, specifying the deliverables. | Previous discussions have veered off into a number of discussions on the general topic of vector / matrix libraries. | Need to modernize implementation of Python bindings. Use of Boost Python is a thorn in our side, CMake does not play well with it. But waiting for someone to have the time and dive in. | . | John: on the security topic there was a failed attempt to get a security working group going, now that we are putting in place a slightly more formal structure for setting priorities we might make more progress. Initial impetus was reactionary, based on OpenEXR having outstanding CVEs. Should define what downstream consumers for our projects expect. Further define what our graduated projects should offer as security-related guarantees. | OpenVDB is struggling with similar issues, hard to define what is meant by “security issues”. Cary: what does a “vulnerability” mean (maliciously constructed images that cause buffer overflows). | Daniel: initial discussions were triggered by CII badge requirements, but didn’t explicitly record the feedback from Foundry engineer as to what is a reasonable security posture. | Andrew: what happens if a project “loses” its CII status? Can it be “ungraduated” / lose its badge? | Larry: if that happens, it indicates that a project isn’t getting the attention it needs. It seems unlikely that an active project would let lapse the work that was done to get the CII status. Daniel: a clear case of failure would be not meeting the SLA for addressing security vulnerability. | . | Next meeting: February 12, 2020 | . ",

    "content": "ASWF CI Goals for Year 2 . Will propose and discuss and ordering of tasks at next week TAC’s meeting (Daniel). | GPU . | GPU build and test as normal part of CI infrastructure, not just a PoC | . | Python3 / VFXPlatform 2020 . | State of Python 3 in OSS and commercial apps: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10XG92byepTD-LEeXx4mBjhGaNPtJsd_QaXlZ866wj7k/edit#gid=0 | Jeff: what’s the timeframe for a Python 3 working group? Daniel: will be defined at next TAC meeting (also USD working group). | . | Windows, Mac . | VFX Reference Platform to target Windows, Mac, specifically compiler specifications | . | Runtime tests with commercial components . | Limited examples so far | Animal Logic has been working on Maya USD plugin with other studios and Autodesk, need to test with Maya | . | Packaging / signing . | Daniel: touched on this a few times, smaller studios would like to have binaries they can consume. | Would this help for developer engagement and outreach? | Or is this a service for end users? | Client OSes are ratcheting up the signing requirements for binaries: OpenEXR tools, OpenCue applications. | Studios run software downloaded and built without too many tools and guarantees of authenticity. | ASWF can own certificates / signing authority. We can provide a secure and authenticated software delivery path. | Dan: GitHub Releases would be a good place to distribute binaries. Further incentive to automate releases. 2GB file limit. | Dan: also getting involved with vcpkg and other package managers so users can get our software throught those packages. | Michael: recent requests for vcpkg packaging of OpenColorIO | . | GitHub / Azure Permissions . | GitHub Actions should make it easier to manage CI aspect | Daniel: asking Dan whether this actually helps? Dan: a user without write permissions doesn’t see the Actions tab on the repo. If you have write but not admin permissions you can see the steps happen. So priority would be to get some permissions on GitHub. | Andrew: right now there are no environment variables to share credentials between repos in a GitHub. Could be very useful for sharing SonarCloud credentials for instance. Should hopefully be available from GitHub Actions soon at the Organization level, with whitelisting of which repos can access credentials / secrets. | For now these “shared” credentials would have to be replicated in every repo for GitHub Actions. | Dan: what about making tweaks to a repo, still need to get the releng team involved (service desk ticket). Andrew: should have TAC level discussion as to allowing some TSC committers repo admin privileges. Concern is bypass of security related processes. | Andrew: there is auditing available, but the GitHub audit logs tend to be massive, so they are not monitored on a recurring basis. | Dan: what can we do to make the releng team comfortable? Andrew: some of the ASWF projects already have that, so some users with committer rights also got admin rights. If we’re going to go down that road, we need to provide an explicit list of who has / needs what rights. We need to make sure we don’t compromise the security posture we are agreeing to. Rights management is not as structured with GitHub as it is with Gerrit (used by some other LF projects). | Andrew: there is now a “maintainer” role at the repo level, every right an admin has with some very specific exceptions, so we should look at role. Admins can still sidestep some requirements since they can turn off “branch protection” for instance, maintainers cannot. For instance don’t want to be able to turn off CLA checks. | Daniel: asking Dan whether “maintainer” would satisfy requirements? Dan: will look at it. | Dan: A document in the repo that lists who has what rights could be useful. Andrew: yes that would help. Dan: will go ahead and put something together, Andrew to review. | . | Exploring GitHub Actions . | Daniel: some explorations | Dan: have been running Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions in tandem, looking to switching to GitHub actions as main CI | Some hiccups that need to be resolved. | GitHub Actions gives you separate files per workflow, want to automate the release process, and GitHub Actions seems to suppor tthat well. | Azure: pull requests from forks don’t have access to any of the secrets, you can flag secrets to be shared, but that breaks the security model. Little better than storing passwords in source files. | Could change standard practice to having developers create PRs against a devel branch, and TSC members would be responsible for then merging into the master branch. Is it a good idea to modify someone else’s PR? But VDB has stringent requirements before something can be merged. But that can help to lower the barrier to contribution, and can make it easier to share secrets with a specific devel branch. | GitHub Actions is felt to be less complex than Azure Pipelines. | Is OpenVDB the only project with secrets (Houdini download)? Aswf-docker project has secrets for pushing to Docker Hub repository. Also shared secret between all projects for SonarCloud. | Forks need to have access to the same testing infrastructure, so we definitely need a solution for that which allows developers access to the infrastructure we have in place. | Should we try to document / script the infrastructure our projects depend on so that individual contributors can stand up their own infrastructure. | Larry: now using GitHub Actions as primary CI for OIIO and OSL, still running others in tandem, only reason Travis is still running is due to ease of using older compilers, but can be solved with Docker. Seems to improve over time, and happy with GitHub Actions. | Daniel: some projects will want to move faster to a new CI infrastructure, some will want to stick with what we currently have. | Andrew: Microsoft strongly pushing towards GitHub Actions for Open Source projects in call with LF releng team, more resources allocated to it. | Larry: haven’t observed GPU support in GitHub Actions, but OSL is starting to need to test on GPU. | Andrew: same problem on GitHub Actions than on Azure Pipelines, only way for now is to add a builder to a static instance pool. GitHub Actions team had promised some kind of dynamic instance creation by end of quarter. | Michael: Larry’s proposal for OSL would help to justify GPU infrastructure, would no longer just be OCIO. | Aloys: will same Docker images work across Azure and GitHub Actions? Dan: yes, seems to work fine. | Larry: is this checked in to current OpenVDB repo so we can look at GitHub Actions scripts? Dan: yes, Linux only for now, but has been in the repo since October / November 2019. | Daniel: sounds like we have a strong agreement to migrate to GitHub Actions. Will be brought up at next week’s TAC meeting and come up with a timetable. | Dan: we should agree to not change our CI for another year! | . | . GPU Resources . | Static / dynamic provisioning . | We need a concrete path to solve the dynamic provisioning challenge | Two options: wait for functionality from CI providers (Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions promising something in next few months) | Or spinning up static instances: pushback from LF Sysop group due to billing problems | Or manual / on demand provisioning for specific build / test steps | Andrew: LF has a master AWS account, and sub accounts dependent on that. So all billing gets invoiced to LF, but broken down by project. If we are doing dynamic instances, each project could be accounted against their account. AWS credits are only applied against the top level account, not the project-specific account. And can only get invoiced (rather than credit card based) if you have enough traffic, so couldn’t have a ASWF-specific top level account. | Andrew: static, long lived build instance falls under security, auditing requirements, all of their LF systems are short lived, and LF sysop doesn’t have the infrastructure to deal with that. | LF releng rebuilds the Jenkins instances every month on the OpenStack infrastructure. | JF: need to make sure for-pay GPU instance cannot be abused, perhaps GPU testing can only be launched from master branch than from a PR in a separate branch? Also should target GitHub Actions if that’s the direction we are going. Will need some help with how to tie this into project workflows. | . | . Project Specific Goals . General Discussion . | Aloys: aswf-docker now includes USD 1911, so can be used to run tests. VFX Reference Platform currently doesn’t specify a USD version, so not super clear which version to target. | Aloys: should we still maintain Python 2.7 support in VFX Platform 2020 build containers? Makes everything more complex to maintain 2 Python versions. | Christina: OpenEXR was trying to run both Python 2.7 and 3, but it’s fine to keep separate containers, run Python 2.7 in the VFX 2019 container, and 3.7 in the VFX 2020 container. | Daniel: ASWF survey showed that everyone seemed quite pleased with the work delivered on the CI side. | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 [0:00-0:10] . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | GPU for CI . | Windows and Mac . | VFXPlatform 2020 . | Runtime testing with Houdini, Maya, Nuke, et al . | New projects . | . | Working groups [0:10-0:30] . | Framework (John)https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/129 . | CI working group was first example of this model . | Looking to move forward with working groups on number of subjects, discussed at face to face model . | Was done mostly ad hoc for CI working group, didn’t have specifically elected lead for the effort, specific timeline or deliverables. Ongoing group with short term goals based on individual needs of the projects. Has gone well for this particular effort. | Model suggested by John is more focused and time limited. | Gordon: like the idea of specific goals and specific timelines. | Daniel: does it make sense to have a process to set the goals of the working group at the TAC level? . | Gordon: as a general model, the TAC should focus its energies on making sure we tackle the right problems to get desired outcomes, and giving each working group opportunity to tackle issues “out of band”. Different challenges may require slightly different models. Seems to work well internally at Autodesk, so we can focus the time of the wider TAC group. | Python 3 example: there may be more focussed experts / people outside the TAC who would be a better fit for that particular activity. | Daniel: working groups is a good model for engagement. “What does it mean to be involved in a working group?”. Template lays out model where only the working group lead is officially designated, otherwise activities of the working group are open (to all). | . | Proposals . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Python 3 (Josh Minor) . | Pick this up early this year | . | USD . | Daniel: Cory has had background discussions with Guido and USD team at Pixar . | Daniel: 2 issues from face to face meeting. Answer request from Pixar to help with support effort on USD message boards to help relieve some of the load on the main USD developers. And effective forum for USD-related discussions. | Cory: discussion with the team on how to tackle the support burden, a lot of them related to building USD at individual facilities. Do we expect the chair of the USD team to be part of the USD team at Pixar? Daniel: we don’t have an answer based on our previous experience, it would make sense that it would be someone who is familiar with either the ASWF of USD. | Michael: several members of the TAC are responsible for USD implementation at their respective facilities, we probably want to be involved with how to help spread the adoption of USD, there’s a high level opportunity to help promote the adoption of USD at a high level. | Cory: can take that feedback back to the USD. Some concern from the USD mailing lists that having discussions on a separate forum might bifurcate some discussions / dilute. | Cory: most concrete area where USD team can use help is the support burden, especially related to building. | Eric / Cory: a bit of a chicken and egg situation between deciding what the group to do / meet the requirements of the working group document? Sean: shouldn’t the group decide what it wants to do? . | Daniel: this is a good “test case” for figuring out the scope of what a working group does. | Sean: if some amount of deep dive is needed by subject matter experts (who aren’t necessarily TAC members), seeding the working group with those members and task them with defining the scope of the working group might work best. | Gordon: agrees with Sean. TAC can define “what is the success of the group”, for instance “remove barriers to success and USD adoption in the industry”, the group can then come up with steps needed to meet this high level goal. “Here are some places we can help, perhaps through CI/CD infrastructure, or additional resources”. Help define what would be missing in current USD offering to help other studio adoption. | Eric: second phase besides focus on adoption could be efficiency of effort, make sure that different studios aren’t duplicating efforts related to USD. | Daniel: is Cory comfortable with the approach presented above? Cory: yes, but needs to make sure the Pixar USD team is OK. Some discussion on the usd-interest mailing list today. A lot of “community helping community” on that list. | Wave: could also have discussions about how we create USD assets, codify / define best practices to using USD. Cory: does that lead to bifurcation from existing mailing list / communication channels? . | Wave: Notes about USD . | Gordon: maybe once we have a list of areas we can focus on, at that point we need to have a working model for some aspects that need tight discussion with USD community. | Eric: does the Google Group have in person meetings outside of SIGGRAPH? Cory: not outside SIGGRAPH. Working group would be more focussed if it has regular calls for instance. | Sean: specific tasks and timelines may conflict with the goal of helping with ongoing support. | Daniel: we agree to defer to further discussion to establish scope and goals to first working group goal. Would Cory agree? Yes. | JF: should existing USD mailing list be used for working group discussions? Cory: could make sense, maybe as the main communication mechanism, or regular updates to that mailing list. | . | Other areas? . | Documentation . | Web site update . | . | . | . | Project proposal: OpenShadingLanguage (Larry) [0:30-0:40] . | https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/message/1196 . | No specific discussion on mailing list . | Larry: won’t spend too much time recapping email. Odd that the proposal came day after face to face meeting, but unfortunately couldn’t quite make that deadline for final sign off. Final OK came at 6PM on day of the meeting! . | Endorsement from Imageworks’ part on how well the ASWF has done. Would have been hesitant to make OSL first submission to ASWF, OSL is very important to SPI, but looking at the success of OCIO for instance, excited as to the future of OSL in ASWF. | GPU centric development is a big focus: project could benefit from more steering by stakeholders. | Project has hummed along smoothly over the last 10 years, has had a lot of active development, but that doesn’t mean it can’t use the help of being part of ASWF. | Fit with ASWF couldn’t be better: the majority of ASWF members are using, have contributed to, or are major users of systems that make use of OSL. | Gordon: thank you Larry! . | Daniel: we have quorum to vote on project incubation status, first step of project adoption to allow the project to start to move into the governance structure. | JF: how much can you leverage from previous project submissions? Larry: the project has already taken some steps to meet some of the work done on existing projects, for instance already at 88% for the CII badge status. Current plan is to model most of the governance documents on what was done for OCIO with minimal tweaks necessary. Should also help with legal / administrative clearances. Hopefully this project can help to move ASWF forward on some technical aspects, for instance OSL is already using GitHub Actions for CI, which we are looking at for other projects. And definitely need a strong GPU infrastructure, currently no way to test GPU contributions, and have seen some breakage due to lack of GPU enabled testing infrastructure. | Daniel: is there some internal GPU testing infrastructure? Larry: the internal version embedded in in-house renderer, so that highlights any breaks quickly, but no good / organized way to do it. Also have to make sure that even people working on non-GPU code don’t break the GPU path. | JT Nelson: Appleseed is now using OSL completely, they dropped their internal shader model, also moving from CPU to GPU. Can check with Appleseed team. | Larry: one of the next milestones is to assemble the right TSC, that should have not sure the developers, but also stakeholders such as “end clients”. Appleseed could provide someone. TSC meetings will be open, and should open up visibility. | Daniel: calling for vote, seconded by Wave, unanimous vote YES. Adopted into incubation stage. | . | Update on candidate projects [0:40-0:50] . | Media player (Darby) . | Interest in open source technologies for media review in facilities . | Darby Johnston is the author of the DJV playback application . | DJV has been around since 2004, cross platform, supports HDR . | Had lull in development over last couple years, but recently picked up development . | Transition from Sourceforge to GitHub . | Looking at ASWF documents as a guideline for some of the work being done on the project . | Recently released new version, not quite feature parity with previous version . | Looking at major features such as playlist (OpenTimelineIO integration), audio . | Looking at feedback from industry as to what features would be useful . | Looking at opening up the development process and getting more people involved . | Daniel: asking Henry to articulate some of our interests (from Foundation members) based on discussion from a few meetings ago. | Henry: many of the member facilities (and specifically DNeg) have had internal review tools, supporting various formats and capabilities, looking at end-of-life internal tools, evaluating some commercial offerings. Looking at new toolsets, codecs, don’t necessarily feel that all requirements are addressed by commercial offerings. Considering starting a new internal project, would be open source. | Darby: is the ASWF adding a media player as an incubation stage process, or this more just an information gathering process? . | Daniel: some of both, identified as an area of need / interest in ASWF surveys. Can one of the project chairs talk about how developer engagement has worked for ASWF projects? . | Michael: a big piece of it is getting a handle on who the users are. For OCIO the experience has been that forming a TSC has been beneficial to getting ideas going. Getting a TSC going, even informally has been very valuable. | Daniel: what has DJV had issues with, IP issues, closed source codecs, where ASWF could assist? . | Darby: would be helpful to have legal advice, codecs that don’t have open source versions, what are guidelines for incorporating those types of codecs in an open source project. Building and packaging has been taking too much of his time, so very interested in CI/CD infrastructure. GPU is GPU powered, so very interested in GPU testing infrastructure. Automated packaging infrastructure would help save a lot of time. | Brian: OpenCue working on packaging as well, and since working on end user applications, there could be some commonality there. | Darby: DJV has been my own project, guided by own wishes and desired, but would be good to build a roadmap once other developers are involved. Not always easy to get structured feedback from DJV users. Python integration identified as useful. | Gordon: do you have an idea as to project adoption / contributing to it? Darby: adoption: this is difficult, packages distributed through SourceForce, about 1000 downloads per week, seems to be used worldwide. Email feedback seems very international. Seems to be used a lot by the freelance community and smaller studios, not really in larger studios. Wasn’t trying to compete with commercial offerings. | JT: definitely promoted as playback tool in 100% open source pipelines. | Darby: would definitely be interested in working with studios with internal tools nearing end of life. Instead of developing tool from scratch, could smaller amount of resources be allocated to a shared project. | . | Rez . | . | CI updates [0:50-0:55] . | Working group . | GPU for CI with dynamic instances . | Will find practical way to move beyond current proof of concept | . | Github Actions . | A lot of interest in moving towards GitHub Actions, will be tested out in some projects . | GitHub Actions API . | GitHub CLI for managing PRs and issues . | . | . | Next meeting: February 26, 2020 . | .

One very good offer from someone who wasn’t already on his list. Will report next week, hold first meeting. | Working on governing documents, mostly a repeat of OCIO, changing names as necessary, borrowing from other projects, but hopefully sticking to the script as much as possible to make it easy to graduate. | . | Google Summer of Code (Larry) [0:15-0:20] . | Congrats on work done by Larry on GSOC. | Tiago joining us on this meeting as a GSCO student. | Larry: ASWF is a mentoring organization announced by Google, not clear how many paid positions will be announced, may be based on number of student applications. Have seen student activity on a couple of projects. Asking project leads about feedback? | Brian: 5 or 6 folks have reached out via email or GitHub, a couple of small PRs. Had to “tone down” the excitement a bit until the program actually starts. | Michael: several people joined slack, a PR submitted, interest in proposed tasks. | Cary: no one reached out to OpenEXR yet. | Aloys: one person reached out to Docker project. They didn’t really say they were part of GSOC program, was assuming they were. Question: do we have to get confirmation that they are “part of the program”? Larry: currently no one is “part of the program”, they will apply in a few weeks, and we will decide who we would want. | Daniel: enthusiasm and support at GSOC program from Governing Board, including other activities within the Academy, including any other activities that would involve students, for instance physical meetups. | Larry: want to encourage everybody if they know students, former interns to point them to our GSCO projects, recruiting is allowed and encouraged. Also the mentoring organization gets a small stipend per student, including some travel allowance to the Google GSOC in person conference at Google (Mountain View). Speakers are a “who’s who” of the open source world. Larry very enthusiastic about this event. | . | USD Working Group (Cory) [0:20-0:30] . | Cory: have filled out proposed form by John. Haven’t created GitHub repo yet (coordinate with LF releng?). | Worded very broadly for now, not a lot of specific language. Encourage best practices, adoption at large in the community. First working group meeting to work on setting more specific goals. | Proposed times on when the meeting might take place, John will send out Doodle poll (see link) and will send out email to TAC list. Looking at people on the TAC to propose potential members. | Daniel: can share view only version of the project templatefor now: | Cory: aim is to support the adoption efforts through consolidation and sharing of best practices, and helping with issues raised in various USD support channels where possible | Not a steering committee: members on the WG will have the same influence on USD as already participating members in the USD community | JF: is there a need to try to leverage the ASWF CI infrastructure? Cory: could be a project, but not necessarily a goal. Would like to be doing CI in the open rather than internally using Jenkins, and having public binaries. Daniel: this should be an achievable goal given some of the infrastructure already in place. | Daniel: key part is that we engage constructively with USD team. Let’s move on to the next steps as proposed. | . | Python 3 Working Group (Josh) [0:30-0:35] . | Daniel: Josh won’t have the bandwidth to take on this project, need to look at someone else, either in the TAC or outside | Had some back and forth with John in the WG template to reflect that the person leading a WG doesn’t have to be a member of the TAC | Is anyone in a position to volunteer themselves, or propose someone external? Can be discussed now or later / off meeting. There is still a lot of interest in leveraging the foundation to achieve this goal. | . | Project Repository Privileges (Dan) [0:35-0:45] . | Has come up a few times in the context of repo setup | Address friction points, project TSE don’t have full access, they need higher level access. GitHub has now added a Maintainer level which offers most of the privileges of Administrator level. | Proposal | Summary of GitHub access levels | Dan not on this call. Have TSC chairs looked at the PR? Does anyone have experience with the other levels of GitHub access control? Some ambiguity as to what some of these permission levels entail. | Kimball: no experience | Daniel: to be followed up with LF releng and Dan at the CI meeting, then take back to TAC meeting for a policy decision. | . | CI Working Group [0:45-0:50] . | GPU agents (JF) . | TAC thread | Supports AWS, Azure, GCP | Uses Terraform Cloud to store state between jobs | Works, but not yet a robust solution, still a PoC | Potential damage limited by only being able to spin up a single GPU accelerated VM per account by default without raising limits (which requires interaction with CSP support). | Azure Pipelines only for now, need to look at GitHub Actions | Daniel: asking Sean whether this looks like it makes sense? Sean: can report offline, not too concerned about optimizing for cost. | Daniel: logical next step would be to take to LF releng team, would they be ready to take this on as supported infrastructure. | . | . | JT: Update on Linux Scale Expo in Pasadena next week, have some passes available | Updates on candidate projects | Varia: . | Daniel: Should aim to solidify TAC goals for this year, will be shared on the mailing list | . | Next meeting . | 11 March 2020 | . | .

    "content": "ASWF CI Goals for Year 2 . | USD . | PR from Aloys against USD to support GitHub Actions CI . | ASWF USD Working Group meeting right after this WG . | Aloys: already a branch to support Azure Pipelines, trying to move USD to Azure Pipelines. Not clear if they considered GitHub Actions. Probably makes sense to go to Azure Pipelines first because of UID issue. | Usd-build Python script will build and install all upstream dependencies, won’t run the tests. | Aloys PR disables the GPU tests since we aren’t there yet. | USD team seems to be keen on accepting this kind of proposal. | Daniel: CI expertise was identified as area where ASWF can help USD effort. | . | Python3 / VFXPlatform 2020 . | PySide 5.12 issues? See vfx-platform-discuss . | Todo: Add patch or PySide 5.13 to docker images to test impact | . | Compiler / OS choice for 2021 . | Aloys: would be nice to move to newer compiler / platform / OS, but will cause issues. | Daniel: we contribute by identifying specific positive points to agitate for that transition. | Larry: projects should update their CIs to have a test case for newer environment, to help inform the conversation about any issues that might pop up. | aswf-docker: “top of tree” builds could include latest environment, but still struggling with Python 3 integration. CY2021 needs to be started based on current proposals. Being able to prototype impact of proposed changes would be very useful. | . | Python 3 . | Daniel: at last TAC meeting we agreed that we should have a WG around Python 3 transition, not just for ASWF projects but also internal projects . | Currently no leader for this project, is anyone interested in leading this effort? Please reach out to Daniel directly. | . | . | Windows, Mac . | Runtime tests with commercial components . | Packaging / signing . | GitHub / Azure Permissions . | Dan’s Proposal PR . | Summary of GitHub permission levels . | . | Exploring GitHub Action . | Aloys: different user / permission model between Azure Pipelines and GitHub . | Aloys: Dan / OpenVDB already running on GitHub Actions . | Aloys: runs as root when running inside a container, whereas Azure configures a user on the fly, runs the steps / jobs as that user. Has impact on testing scripts, USD tests don’t all work as root (test for /etc writable). Should be possible to work around this. Maybe will need a different set of Docker images? Hopefully not. | Aloys: –user option can’t be used to change the default user inside a running Docker container, only when creating container. Seems like only one other person on the Internet / in Google was reporting a similar issue. | Daniel: have you (Aloys) found a contact person at GitHub? Aloys: haven’t tried to reach out yet, problem just popped up yesterday. | JF: https://github.com/jfpanisset/cloud_gpu_build_agent . | JF: similar yet slightly different deployment for self hosted agent (even the version numbers are mostly lined up). GitHub Actions has an API for self hosted runners in particular to deal with generating a specific token to add a runner . | GitHub Actions predefines environment variables GITHUB_ACTIONS (“true” when running in GitHub Actions), GITHUB_TOKEN (token for interacting with GitHub API) and GITHUB_REPOSITORY (current repo path), so a bit less setup needed in the CI environment. | JF: in GitHub actions if one matrixed job fails the others will be automatically terminated if there’s a follow up dependent job . | JF: only one “level” of jobs in GitHub Actions, vs stages / jobs in Azure Pipelines. Syntax is very similar yet slightly different: sample Azure Pipelines YML vs GitHub Actions Workflow . | Python is a “first class citizen” for running scripts, could be good for portability Windows / Linux . | Daniel: has there been public discussions of future of GitHub Actions vs Azure Pipelines? Maybe a question for Andrew in lf-releng, they’ve had discussions with Microsoft on this topic. | Dan: a few small roadblocks looking at GitHub Actions. Trying to move Windows build from Appveyor. Issue of being able to download version of Houdini, what can you do about forked PRs, doesn’t pass secrets from master to fork. Trying to figure out a way to have secrets for forked PRs. Looking at caching in GitHub Actions to put Houdini download key in that cache. Have switched default to devel branch. Perhaps a manual approval step for running these PR checks? . | Daniel: specifics of secret handling between master and fork, is that different between Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions? Yes, Azure Pipelines has an option for “share secrets with forks”, even though it recommends not to do it. | Dan: have a working PR for moving Windows build from Appveyor to GitHub Actions, need to get lf-releng to switch off Appveyor integration. Michael: still using Appveyor for supporting older releases. Dan: Appveyor is running under Andy’s (lf-releng) account. Dan: hard to debug these issues when you can’t see the settings since you don’t have admin access. | Michael: no work yet on GitHub Actions for OCIO, but on the todo list. Patrick Hodoul noticed that some older OS versions getting deprecated on Azure Pipelines this month, so may need to be taken care of. | Larry: OSL has used GitHub Actions for a while, don’t see a reason to change, but haven’t had to access secrets yet. Has been pretty happy with it. | . | . GPU Resources . | JF’s PoC TAC list thread . | Support for Azure, AWS and GCP | Working on GitHub Actions support | . | . Project Specific Goals . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Emily: starting planning for SIGGRAPH, contingent to current COVID-19 situation, there will be a contingency plan / online only if needed. Looking at feedback on last year’s Open Source, originally thinking on Sunday, now looking at Monday (full / single day). Last year the day was packed, can’t pack everything into a single day. Looking at shorter BoFs or 2 tracks (with non overlapping interests). | USD Working Group (Cory) . | Cory: Well attended first call last Wednesday, minutes will be posted soon. Went over aims of the USD WG with the USD leads. Template as written right now is as specific as we would want it to be. Desire for collaborative development, also a schema working group. Trying to make sure these are currently not in scope as per the template document. Main focus is driving adoption and defining best practices, as well as assistance with support on existing channels (usd-interest mailing list). | Repository has been set up: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/wg-usd . | Next meeting (50m) set for next Wednesday, more time to discuss aspects of formation, should be able to come up with consensus as to where the WG is going. | Should be possible to announce WG to usd-interest list soon, didn’t want to end up with too many people on the original call. | Does it make sense to discussion on the usd-interest list rather than the tac list? . | General feedback is that this first meeting went well. | . | Python 3 Working Group? (Daniel) . | Daniel: still looking for someone to lead Python 3 WG, a few people are working on answers to Daniel based on their respective organization . | Larry: do we have an “elevator pitch” as to what the working group is trying to do? . | Daniel: lots of individual efforts from studios on efforts to port to Python 3, would be useful to share the results of some of these efforts, libraries / modules that were written. Create an environment where we can go beyond just Python 3 support in ASWF projects. | LA Pipeline meetup planed on Python 3 on 25-March . | Daniel: significant effort was required. Cory: NVIDIA helping with USD, trying to get code to be compatible with 2 and 3, using Python Futurize. Some time in late spring / early summer plan to be building dependency chain including Python 3. Process is planned, not expecting to switch active productions until 2020H2 or 2021H1. Depending on external DCCs of course. Henry: So far has been a semi ad-hoc approach, I’m bringing in a project lead for this project who starts end-of-March who may be a candidate to lead the ASWF WG. | . | Repository access levels (Dan / Andy) . | Dan: was discussed extensively in CI WG. We are looking at trying to eliminate some of the back and forth with LF releng group and make debugging easier. Not possible to see how repos are configured. 2 specific areas: . | Adding and editing secret variables (specifically for download of Houdini) . | Modify branch protection rules: number of approvals, mandatory vs optional checks. | . | PR . | Andy: back and forth on the PR, general agreement from lf releng, just needs TAC review / approval, some sort of vote. | Dan: maintainer level doesn’t give much above write level privileges. | Henry: are there specific privileges you get with admin that are required? . | JF: you need a token with administrative permissions to generate a registration-token to allow self-hosted runners to register with GitHub Actions . | Dan: will use caching to work around some of the issues of not having access to secrets in branches . | Daniel: calling for vote. No dissenting, Eric abstains as not active in CI. Motion passes. Thank you to Dan and Andrew for moving this forward. | . | Google Summer of Code Update (Larry) . | Some of the lists have seen some requests from some students. | Michael Dolan: 2 students working on proposals on OCIO, will be reviewed with mentors before they submit official proposals. Tackling issues put up on GitHub, following requirements in the outline, and creating PRs. Time of submission is approaching quickly. | Larry: may be the first time that OCIO accepts a PR from someone who isn’t a well known member of the color science community, hopefully will also happen on the other projects. Deadline in a couple of weeks, then we have a couple of weeks to respond to Google with how many slots we feel should get sponsored, and designate mentors to pair. | Daniel: hopefully this can help to make our projects somewhat easier to engage with. | Larry: what does it take to get a somewhat more junior person from outside the community to contribute. | Michael: a couple of PRs included code that hadn’t been compiled before. | . | CI updates . | Working group . | GPU agents (JF) . | Supports AWS / GCP / Azure . | Uses Terraform cloud for persistent state . | Runs on Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions . | GitHub Actions: lack of “secret files” means workarounds for ssh private keys (encode LFs as _), GITHUB_TOKEN doesn’t have administrative privileges and cannot be used to generate runner registration token, need to generate specific PAT . | . | Daniel: what would be the minimal steps required from projects and lf-releng to bring this into project builds. | Andrew: has not had a chance to look at it in detail. There are secrets involved. Should we focus on GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines? Will need a request to the helpdesk for the cloud keys. Discussions with GitHub on secrets in fork: secrets management in forks is coming, will be possible in the future. Also possible to limit running CI runs based on approval from project maintainers. Hopefully can designate some contributors as being able to run CI workflows without approval. Jenkins has more protection for workflows than GitHub Actions. We don’t want PRs that can modify code and workflows at the same time, they should be different PRs. | Dan: GitHub allows modifying which branch a PR ends up, so could point to an integration branch, and only run the GPU testing. Could use a comment / tag to trigger a GPU test run. | Daniel: how do we integrate offer from some of the ASWF member companies (cloud providers), can they be managed in a single pool through lf-releng, or through a sub pool. Andrew: no easy answer, especially for AWS due to how billing works. May need to be fleshed out offline. | . | . | Project Updates . | OpenShadingLanguage adoption (Larry) . | Looks like a quorum to get a TSC started, took some back and forth with some of the stakeholders . | Trying to schedule a first meeting . | There are a couple of gaps we have: we don’t have great coverage for people who really know Windows, this has plagued the project all along. Also the list of potential contributors severely lacks diversity, so if anyone has suggestions, please contact Larry. Would be nice to broaden the scope of voices participating and actively participating in the project. Hoping that some of the TSC members become developers. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Rez: would need to be relicensed with a more ASWF-compatible license, which is a non trivial effort. | . | Next meeting . | 25 March 2020 | . | .

People may be more available to work on our projects? | May be people looking for new positions / time to invest in getting familiar with our projects | . | areas of technical need for studios . | Our workflows are changing, anything we can address as a group? For instance lots of discussion about review tools, an area we have already discussed in the TAC, but what about review tools that work remotely: how to work on less reliable connections, capture the social aspect of reviews, secure distribution of media. | Daniel: review tools have been identified as an area of interest, lots of review tools out there, open source and commercial. Most do very similar things, and are expensive to maintain and are critical infrastructure. There isn’t an obvious tool as to what tool we could collaborate on. Should we add to an existing OSS tool and add features needed by studio. Most obvious candidate is DJV, Darby has joined a previous TAC call. He doesn’t have a very clear idea of his customer based / requirements (nature of OSS projects). Most of the r studios are using commercial / proprietary tools. | Larry: mostly hearing in the big studios that for the most part they are working at home through one of several schemes to VPN and access their usual workstation via remote view (HP RGS / Teradici). Not much changes for most artists / developers except working in a different location. But a subset of users is highly affected such as editorial (working on air-gapped systems), color grading. | Daniel: remote desktop approach is pretty effective, doesn’t capture all workflows, issues with constrained bandwidth, issues with fidelity of updates with full screen video. Social collaboration aspect of shared reviews is lost. Also using shared review tools. | Michael: Netflix has created document for Remote Editorial workflow. A number of proprietary paid services are available, but not every project will want to pay for those. Remote Editorial Memo (during COVID-19) | Bill: editorial and color correct workflows are challenging. Have used SyncSketch and found some value in that. All artists are working at some level of productivity. | . | VES Technology Committee collaborative document, everyone can contribute via comments and we’ll incorporate to document (more systems oriented). https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iP1AWDAMvNlymT626PQbKUfC52wqyIhoqoGsNn-nOLA/edit# | #discuss-dr on StudioSysadmins Slack | . | Technical Project updates . | Daniel: Any particular risk factors? Availability of key contributors? Potential issues on CI infrastructure? Using largely public services with open configurations helps. | Projects seems to be in pretty good shape overall, broader range of people involved, should help with resilience. | After previous meeting we discussed delegating more repo permissions, that came up on governing board meeting yesterday. Linux Foundation is also a distributed and resilient organization, most members are already working from home and geographically distributed. Nothing we need to immediately act on, but please share any issues that may come up. | OpenVDB | OpenColorIO . | Doug: No COVID concerns raised during slack discussion, all used to working remotely. Roadmap proceeding on track. Minor disruptions as people get used to WFH, but still on track. Still very early in this crisis, not clear how things will evolve over time as the economic impact rolls out. Need to keep monitoring closely and respond as appropriate. But so far so good. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: pretty quiet, cancelled TSC last two weeks, not necessarily COVID related, but everyone busy with other commitments. Succeeded in addressing most outstanding issues and PR, so kind of quiet time. Longer term goal of bigger release around SIGGRAPH time, haven’t really discussed the implications of the current situation, need to strategize how to tackle some of the larger issues targeted for this release. Expect to be quiet for a few more weeks as we “settle into the new normal”. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: nothing major to report, drop in contributions, but code reviews are still moving through. Reduced activity but moving along. | . | OpenTimelineIO . | Josh: OTIO moving forward, conf calls with Avid and Netflix scheduled for this week. Pleased with level of activity so far. Some delays expected, but nothing too significant. | . | OpenShadingLanguage . | Larry: last week was supposed to have the first TSC meeting, but postponed due to studios transitioning to WFH. Expect to hold first TSC some time next week. Don’t anticipate specific issues, having access to work machines from may actually help a bit. | . | . | Google Summer of Code update . | Larry: End of week is deadline for student applications. Then 2 week period for organizations to evaluate proposals and ask for support, was extended to 3 weeks because of COVID situation. After students are accepted there is a period of “community bonding”, that seems that have already (informally) started, helped by requirement to have students submit a PR. | Doug / OCIO: 8-9 applications so far, 5-6 seem serious. Requiring people to do a PR (Larry suggestion) really help to find people who are really serious, lots of back and forth with some of the students. Looking forward to having good participation this summer. | Josh / OTIO : 3-4 students have been asking, submitting PR. Misjudged the scope / size of suggested projects, what was thought to be a large project turned out to be a single PR, some projects thought to be small turned out to be much more complicated. One proposal was a student sharing a Google Doc. Is there an official place for these proposals? Doug: should be on the GSoC official site. Josh: looked there but didn’t find it. Doug: make sure that we sign up for the mentorship program, need to sign up for this with Google. | Brian / OpenCue: PR requirement is great, similar issues on scoping. Encouraging prospective students to share their proposals on a Google Doc to allow more back and forth. Propose a goal for the summer that would be only part of the project, and then a stretch goal. 15-20 people have reached out via email, 4-5 proposals, may go up to 10 by the deadline. Quite a few are good. Didn’t realize that it could be a “full time job” to deal with the email traffic. Larry: it’s a good investment, visibility of the project will outlast the SoC, so upfront cost is worth it. Number of serious students interested in our projects is higher than expected. A couple of students asked about multiple proposals / interested in multiple project ideas. Should they submit multiple proposals, or a single proposal covering multiple projects? Larry: they can submit up to 3 proposals across organizations, we can probably do whatever we want, if a student wants to propose against 2 separate ASWF projects, we can pick the one where we think is the best fit. | Dan / OpenVDB: 4-5 people reached out, no applications yet. May be related to “barrier to entry” of OpenVDB. | Carry / OpenEXR: a few people reached out, but no proposals yet. No specific emails other than the trial PR. Daniel: any areas identified that would be worth proposing? Cary: Put together a set of proposals, but no one is “biting” at those yet. | . | CI updates . | Working group | Still trying to work out policies for controlling the use of GPU build agents (billing, external PRs). Andy / Sean / JF ? Hopefully some progress by next week’s CI meeting. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting | . ",

    "content": "ASWF CI Goals 2020 [0:00-0:10] . | Linux, Windows, Mac platform support . | Best support on Linux . | Windows, Mac lagging behind, some of the projects have their own ways of doing things, but no reuse / shared approach . | . | GPU CI support . | Lots of progress in principle but not in practice | . | CMake best practice . | Best practices shared between projects | . | Top of tree builds for classic CI workflows . | Expanding the types of builds as we migrate to GitHub Actions | . | VFXPlatform 2020 / Python 3 . | Using our projects as opportunity to share best practices and expertise, could be a benefit to other projects / studios . | Some kind of support in CI system for Python 2 and 3 builds . | Offering our platform Docker images with Python 3, do we also support Python 2 for VFX Reference Platform 2020? Does the 2019 platform stay relevant for longer to continue supporting Python 2.7? Or VFX Platform 2020 with Python 2.7 to simplify build matrix? . | . | Gordon: these goals and priorities have been around for a while, how should they be positioned now? Daniel: led by what the projects have been asking for the most, going forward we may want to focus our activities based on what the group thinks we should be doing going forward. Main priority remains GPU support in CI system (OCIO and OSL need this). Next priority (based on survey feedback) is Windows / Mac platform support. Bradley: agreed. A typical problem is not knowing when a project is over, “we could do good stuff all year, but are we doing the right stuff”? . | A future goal is deliverables directly to various package managers (Conda / Artifactory /…). | . Follow ups: [0:10-0:30] . | GPU-enabled CI . | Management of use of dynamic instances from non-free pool . | See discussion at last TAC meeting . | Daniel: We have had a working prototype for Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions, can spin up a GPU instance based on external event (PR), left to figure out practical and organizational issues. Specifically how do we manage the costs, how frequently do we run the tests. And how do we make policy decisions robust to implement and track. Also need to make the number and cost of jobs visible and manageable to keep track of how much we are spending, even if these are credits provided by CSP foundation members (needed by LF RelEng Team). Specifically we need a ceiling on resource / cost consumption. | Andy: need to decide on a few things before we can move on a solution. 1) Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions? Determines which of the PoCs we will be using. 2) Which CSP are we going to use (PoC supports AWS / Azure / Google). We want to pick one to start with, eventually we can support multiple clouds to optimize costs. | JF: Should we target getting this working on GitHub Actions since that’s the general direction our CI is taking, or stick with Azure Pipelines? My sample repo supports both, and I would personally favor GitHub Actions (and that becomes an additional carrot to move projects to that CI if they want GPU support). Michael: haven’t moved to GitHub Actions yet, but planning to switch in the next month or so. Christina: also planning to move to GitHub Actions. -&gt; Decision is to go forward with GPU on GitHub Actions only. | Daniel: to answer the second question, since Sean is on the call and has been active on this topic, suggesting we go with AWS. Sean: agrees. Andrew: most expertise at RelEng is OpenStack and AWS, then Google, then Azure. -&gt; let’s go with AWS. | Sean: any support that AWS can offer from a build / CI/CD point of view, happy to provide expertise from AWS resources. Can reach him directly by email. | JF: something perhaps worth exploring is the ability to restrict what a specific Cloud Provider token is allowed to do, so that even if a credential got stolen by a malicious PR that was approved and looked fine at first, there’s only so much an attacker could do with it before it got revoked. By default all 3 cloud providers require specific approval through a helpdesk ticket before allowing you to allocate GPU instances, and the default limit is set to 1. CSPs typically have pretty sophisticated permission models, so it may be possible to have CSP credentials / tokens that are only allowed to create and access specific types of infrastructure. Andrew: yes, RBAC can be used to circumscribe what can be done with a set of credentials / tokens. | Andrew: with GitHub Actions have to do per-repo credentials, so need a RelEng support desk ticket to set up the required infrastructure. Also need AWS instance set up with correct access. Issue with AWS is that they have a multi-organization account, so credits could not be targeted, but apparently that’s no longer an issue, and credits can be targeted to a sub-organization (learned this last week). Sean: confirmed, Andrew to provide account number to Sean to provide the credits. Andrew: LF has been asking for a lot of credits… Sean: Studio Tech team has more leeway. | Daniel: Which project to target? Is OCIO a good project? Michael: should be good, transition to GitHub Actions will be put to “top of list”. Daniel: coupling two new things together always a risk, but should hopefully be OK. | Daniel: what would be a reasonable deadline? By next CI meeting in 4 weeks? Michael: will create LF RelEng ticket to get setup going for OCIO repo. | . | . | Docker image build updates . | VFX2019 + USD, which version(s)? Aloys’ post . | Christina: as long as we have some image we can run Python 3 against, OpenEXR will be fine. Either separate Python 2 / 3 images or a single combined image, either will work. Having them separate means matching the VFX Platform spec. | Michael: OCIO has outstanding PR for Python 3 support. | Daniel: looks like we are happy to keep a single set of versions via the VFX Reference Platform. We move forward with Python 3 with the VFX Reference Platform 2020. | What about USD inclusion? We can’t directly influence when USD will support Python 3. Which version of USD should be bundled with our 2019 containers? Maybe more interesting to people depending on USD, none of our projects depend on USD yet. | Gordon: no simple answer. Internally struggling with internal software, Maya, Arnold, Bifrost, even getting those to agree on a USD version is tricky. Want to leave clients to build their own version, so the shipped version (from VFX Reference Platform) can be replaced. Also complexity of shipping both Python 2 and Python 3 support, trying to make that a single install. Still a long way from standardizing USD adoption schedules. At some point USD evolution may slow down, but seems like we haven’t reached that point yet, so being able to replace it is important. Does that match other people’s experience? . | Christina: were trying to run both the Python 2 and Python 3 tests in a single build, but that’s not necessary, can run separate build / test cycles. | Daniel: USD is moving very quickly, so most users are interested in moving USD forward quickly, especially if you have data that’s linked to a newer USD version. | . | . CI Updates for Projects [0:30-0:40] . | SonarCloud quality gates: https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/academysoftwarefoundation/projects . | Only OpenCue currently passing . | Not all projects have the scans going . | What should we do to get value out of them . | Michael: Patrick Hodoul has been putting in PRs to resolve some of the issues, but new ones keep popping up. Daniel: is this a useful process that generates meaningful improvements to the code base? Michael: yes, does help to clean things up, some issues are subtle, but someone gave time to thinking about what gets included. Can be a challenge when doing active development. As projects stabilized hopefully we can focus on that more. | Should project TSCs have a “formal” discussions of what SonarCloud warnings should be disabled for a specific project. Daniel: the configuration already lives in the repository, so changes to the config should go through the usual PR process for a project. Already gives a level of scrutiny to those changes. Perhaps changes to these files should be made independently to other changes, could be an add PR-level rule. Alternatively could be some kind of policy-mandated for TSC review. | Michael: quality gate can be customized, but it’s configured in SonarCloud itself, not in the repo. OCIO is using the default one, not customized. Discussed commenting in the source code to identify changes made specifically to please the SonarCloud quality gate. | Christina: haven’t configured the Quality Gate, and adding comments to the code. Marked a few that weren’t going to fix. | OpenVDB is running SonarCloud, but in a separate organization. | Michael: nightly SonarCloud run if there’s been a commit, and a weekly unconditional run. | . | . CI Platform [0:40-0:50] . | GitHub Actions / Azure Pipelines . | Already addressed in context of GPU . | Not enough project representation to discuss a timeline for transition, but we’ve broadly decided to move on to GitHub Actions. Leverage knowledge between projects. | . | . CI System Reusability . | Gordon: this came up internally while working on Maya USD plugin, what kind of CI could be put around that. One of the Action Items was to go look at the ASWF CI to see if that could be reused. Unfortunately it JF:wasn’t clear what we are currently doing, it’s not really documented, and instead embedded in the projects / tribal knowledge. How can we help others to leverage this information. | JF: The Sample Project is an attempt to answer these questions: https://github.com/jfpanisset/aswf-sample-project . | JF: need to open ticket with LF RelEng to move the repo to the ASWF organization, and needs to be updated to be current. | Andrew: will add a note to the Jenkins-based repos to mark that this is no longer used. | Gordon: we should capture our CI decisions in a higher level document, and should be linked from the ASWF web site. | .

    "content": ". | New member introduction: Christopher Kulla (OSL TSC Chair) [0:00-0:10] . | OSL adoption process, first TSC meeting happened last week, chair was elected, Chris Kula from Imageworks. | Chris: Rendering Lead at Imageworks, will be chair of OSL project. Had first meeting, Larry in process of transitioning things over, establishing founding documents. Leveraged experience from OCIO, should be fairly straightforward process. Should be able to get this done in next meeting or two. | Project will have an architect position: Larry Gritz taking that position. | . | Google Summer of Code (Larry) [0:10-0:20] . | Last time we met the applicants had just come in and deadline had just closed. | Lots of activity in the last week to narrow down the applicants. | Larry: applications have been triaged, interesting process. 75 applications, ⅔ of which were “not serious” (mostly empty or one line, or elaborate proposals not pertinent to our organization). But 22 were valid proposals, next step is for projects to look at ones that are relevant to them, rank and evaluate them. | Each project to evaluate a “front runner” they want to go for. Official Google guidelines say that first time organizations will get only one to two, but we are an unusual organization that covers a number of projects with people who have experience with the process, so perhaps we might get more? . | Meeting next week to come up with a unified list, and submit list to Google on April 21st. | Brian: got 4 or 5 strong proposals. Larry: hopefully people who don’t get selected might still want to “stick around”. | Michael: 1 or 2 good candidates for OCIO . | Larry: 1 very strong front runner for OpenEXR, with a couple of others as well. | Daniel: should we take up the topic of how many students with Google? Larry: we technically tell them a minimum and maximum number. Daniel: the model of a foundation requiring multiple students should not be an exception. | Daniel: how do we engage all of the good students who submitted, we should very actively target those students. Projects accepted under the Google program get additional structure and resources, but what about projects that are valid but don’t make it in GSoC? . | Larry: we haven’t done the hard part of mentoring students yet, we’ll soon know how much time / effort it takes to mentor a student. If there is extra money available to sponsor students, could be done at other times throughout the year. | Daniel: as a group we have the resources and authority to pursue those approaches. | Larry: if we only get GSoC for 2 students but there are 4 outstanding proposals… . | Gordon: getting students productive could take a significant amount of time. | Chris Kulla: degree of involvement with any particular student can take very different amounts of time based on who the person is. | John: there are parts of Linux Foundation Community Bridge that could be used if we decided to sponsor students directly. Daniel: Community Bridge can offer the additional step of linking a company that needs a specific feature to a specific activity. | Daniel: to what extent do the students who applied overlap with our Diversity &amp; Inclusion goals? Larry: pretty good for diversity along the international and age axis, but probably not along other axis. | Gordon: if there was at least one opportunity to help meet some D&amp;I goals, that could be useful. | Bill: has Google provided info on diversity from last year? Larry: probably but hasn’t seen it yet. Google typically publishes blog entries on the topic. | Daniel: more feedback at next TAC meeting. | . | CI updates (Working Group) [0:20-0:30] . | Migrate to GitHub Actions by July? . | Focus on GitHub Actions for all projects instead of trying to support both Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions. Will try to migrate all projects to GitHub Actions. Helps with making subtle differences between the two systems, such as a single credential / secret sharing system. | . | GPU setup: OCIO on GitHub Actions and AWS . | Choose project and cloud provider: OCIO and AWS | . | Michael: started migrating project to GitHub Actions this week, syntax is fairly similar to Azure Pipelines, shouldn’t be a huge undertaking. Some cool features in GitHub Actions, non-CI actions such as marking stale pull requests, should be a positive move in general. | OpenVDB has already advanced along this route. | Brian: OpenCue has done some basic research, but no major progress yet. Proposed timeframe should work. | John: commonality of infrastructure is a goal, so it’s not just the current 6 projects. | JF: aswf-sample-project opened ticket to move to ASWF GitHub organization. | JF: would be really helpful if the ASWF web site was backed by GitHub. John: Daniel could bubble this up to the Board. Will contact Emily for high level updates to the web site. | Michael: have ticket for OCIO with releng once moved to GitHub Actions . | Chris: OSL will be eager to test the GPU support as well. OSL is already on GitHub Actions. Michael: if OSL is ready before OCIO, they can just go ahead. Larry: if someone wants to use OSL as the test bed for GitHub Actions, go ahead since they already have that in place. Chris: happy to volunteer to get this going. | Chris: is there any kind of alignment in term of matrix of configurations we want to try (VFX platform years). Daniel: very good question, something that has been discussed in the past but no uniform guidance so far. Most projects on Linux are using the Docker images from Aloys project, there’s some interesting complexity with the current year being still in flux, USD, Python 2 or 3… Larry: the Reference Platform doesn’t make explicit statements as to how many years back of the platform should be supported. Not always clear how far back you have to support. Michael Min: agreed. Daniel: OpenVDB has a very clear position on these questions. Kimball: answer will be different if you are part of the VFX Platform or not. Also non-Linux platforms have the least amount of consistency right now. | Michael Dolan: once you get beyond 10 concurrent jobs your CI time goes up a lot, OCIO mostly testing against VFX Reference Platform 2019, even testing 2 years you can end up with 15 different jobs for every PR. | Larry: is there logic in the GitHub Actions to select which combinations of builds we want to try depending on the type of build? Michael: yes, OCIO does this right now: there’s a nightly build if there’s been a commit, also runs SonarCloud, but does not run on PRs. Possible to test which type of build is running and skip some combinations accordingly. | . | Zoom guidelines (John) [0:30-0:35] . | GitHub PR . | Based on CNCF guidelines. | Zoom is the current choice for a lot of online collaboration, and many security implications. | Some issues linked with the Zoom platform itself, others linked to setup (“Zoom Bombing”). | Everyone will need a Zoom account to join a meeting, additional controls on screen sharing, moderator control. Can also password protect private meetings. | Also general best practices: how to deal with someone who is being inappropriate in a meeting, along with good ideas for a meeting. | Daniel: what about company systems that use “rooms” and “bridges”, will this cause an issue? John: should not interfere, will need to enter the password if you join by phone. What about if you are using a SIP client? May need help to test some of the combinations. | Daniel: can always use the TAC mailing list to note that there’s been a change of configuration / help anyone who has issues connecting. John: we can add some explicit language to the document as to who to contact in case of problems. | . | Code of Conduct for ASWF / Projects (John) [0:35-0:40] . | GitHub PR . | A lot of our projects have aligned with the Linux Foundation LLC Code of Conduct. | Tried to clarify which project is lining up on what. | Larry noticed that we have 4 projects that have some specific changes, is that OK? . | Larry: copied the OpenEXR document when creating OSL, but John noticed that there are a few changes that paraphrase the Linux Foundation CoC. | Larry: less aligning existing projects, more that there should be a sensible, single default for new projects. | Larry: many open source communities have long discussions on the topic, having a single default one can help with that, but don’t need to change any project that have already established one retroactively. | John: we can also just accept the CoC from a new project that has already created one that generally lines up. | . | Working Group updates [0:40-0:50] . | Template PR GitHub . | Python 3 . | Productive meeting of the LA Pipeline Meetup on the topic of Python 3, should TAC partner with that group for instance? . | Good international participation, recording is available: . | . | USD . | USD WG suspended for now due to current situation . | Daniel: got some questions as to whether the TAC / Foundation could help with to support the WG, this WG needs high level of involvement by Pixar. | Daniel: are there specific areas where we could make some contributions to the goals of this WG? . | Larry: just how suspended is this? Or do we expect this to be a long term thing? USD-related needs at SPI are not shrinking? . | Cory: not a long term suspension by any means, a lot of workload from supporting current productions, so don’t want to add load to the USD team, but should be able to re-engage soon. Even things that USD team has asked for help still require involvement from USD team. | Daniel: current timeframe for suspension is through end of April, but to be revisited. | Cory: asking Larry, which are the USD-related activities at SPI that might be helped by the WG? Larry: interested in “how should we organize shots / layers / sequences”, “how to deal with areas where there are no published schemas”. Looking forward to a forum to help discuss and determine best practices, and hopefully get guidance from others who have already made progress on these topics. Cory: some of this might be done without the involvement of the USD teams, but of course Pixar USD team has a lot of experience using USD on movies. Larry: SPI happy to throw some resources, have already contributed several PRs to the project. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Emily and Wave have been working on this topic. | Specific proposal is to put together a WG. | Emily: create a more formal WG, not everyone on the TAC may be the best person to drive these efforts. TAC members should look inside their own organizations to see if there is someone who would be interested / qualified to join this effort. Bill: should people interested reach out directly to Emily? Emily: yes, also should there be some kind of formal “vote” to establish a WG? Daniel: yes, as per the above discussion on the more formalized WG process. Emily: want to put together a short list of people interested in taking part in this effort. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | . ",

    "content": ". | Recording of TAC and TSC meetings (Daniel) [0:00-0:05] . | Everyone should be aware that meetings are now being recorded, do we feel this is good with respect to transparency / full access to our discussion, or is it better to stick to written notes where some editing / redaction is possible. | Josh: is the motivation to allow better access to people who couldn’t access the meeting? John: there is no requirement that meetings need to be recorded, but it is important to stress transparency. CNCF / Kubernetes records their meetings. Good for people considering engaging to see what the community looks like. Also TAC meetings are open to the public and are thus on “public record”. But it is not a hard requirements for projects to do this, but it is seen as a “best practice”. Daniel: can help to make a TAC meeting more approachable. | Has anyone watched those recordings? They aren’t easily found right now. Eric: we may want to way costs vs benefits. Some projects actually put their recordings on YouTube. | Written notes provides “temporal compression” compared to having to watch the whole thing. Some members are expressing concerns over privacy, or self censorship. | Could someone request recordings specifically when they can’t attend? . | Andrew: projects that don’t record only have meeting notes, projects require “immutable minutes” for auditing purposes. But there have been cases where members have gone back to the recordings to help clarify what was captured in the minutes, in some projects the minutes are very sparse and don’t capture the discussions that lead to an actual decision. So you can understand more what the discussions that lead to the decision. | Daniel: perhaps the recording should be done, but access shouldn’t be automatic “to the world”, access should be on request. | Daniel: TAC meetings been recorded for the last 2 or 3 meetings but not published. What about TSC meetings? John: unsure, some of the TSCs are using different Zoom rooms, so no clear answer right now. | Daniel: we should have a vote on the topic, we should defer that vote to the next meeting so we can discuss over email. | . | Agenda automation via GitHub (John) [0:05-0:10] . | Pull Request . | John: Some other communities such as Node.JS are doing this. GitHub actions brings some really interesting integrations, allowing GitHub Issues to be used to track progress on issues and automate the collection of these Issues to automatically generate agenda. | Not a hard requirement of course, seeing if there’s interest. Can tweak deadline for when agenda gets closed off. | Trying to reduce the amount of operational / admin work. | Any project could use this process as well for their TSC. Could be added to the aswf-sample-project template project. | Chris: since OSL is just getting started, would definitely be interested in taking a look at that workflow. Started on the assumptions that Google Docs may be a simpler way to manage these documents, but even a single Google Doc is annoying from a formatting point of view. | John: happy to work with OSL on this. | Chris: hopefully the process is not too complicated / intricate so it doesn’t introduce an additional maintenance burden. John: toolchain is design to be simple, you just set your meeting frequency, and the interval before a meeting for generating the meeting agenda. Creates it as a single GitHub Issue that collectively contains the meeting agenda and all the linked Issues as meeting items. Output from GitHub Issues is Markdown, so can add automatic headers for instance. | Daniel: a project using GitHub Issues for tracking / reporting, this could work quite well. Less clear if this works for the TAC? Larry: this is the other way around, don’t want to clutter the Issues list on code projects with discussion items, should only be for the code. Prefer a live Google Doc for OSL, archive to Markdown only once every couple of months. | John: depends on how projects want to operate. In Javascript projects their process is driven by GitHub Issues and PRs, so it makes sense for these projects, and helps with transparency, but it can indeed add clutter. We want to make sure we provide tools that potentially make projects easier to work with, but no obligation to use those. Still worth documenting in the sample project as options to use for new projects. | Daniel: would it be possible to point at a project that is already using this system as an example? John: will provide an example. Daniel: open to try this on the TAC repo as an example for the projects. | Larry: if we have contacts at GitHub, it would be interesting to engage with their engineers / product people to help provide explicit tools to manage project agendas instead of “hijacking” the Issues / PR projects. | Chris: what about using the GitHub Wiki for the project? John: LF has great contacts with GitHub, so happy to engage with them with workflow ideas. | . | Project Admins (Daniel, Dan) [0:10-0:15] . | OpenVDB TSC voted to grant Dan Bailey as Project Admin . | Other projects could follow if they feel the need . | Dan: process has gone fine, not clear if he has Admin rights yet. Andrew: please put in LF releng support ticket. Dan: will do. | . | Feedback on process . | . | Google Summer of Code Update (Larry) [0:15-0:25] . | Larry: ASWF got a total of 3 slots, better than the 1-2 we were told to expect, but less than the 5 we were hoping for . | Will need to boil down 5 top choices down to 3, short deadline on April 30th, but when students apply to multiple projects / organizations, they may accept the first organization that offers the slot, so best to do this ASAP to avoid losing students we really want to get. | . | ASWF Sample Project (JF) [0:25-0:30] . | Looking for a co-reviewer: Daniel happy to be a co-reviewer. Anyone else from the other projects? Kimball: happy to do it as well. JF to open ticket with lf releng. | Daniel: we need to make it clear what are the processes we’ve been deciding on, we need to update some of our early documents, especially what is on the external web site. Working with Emily to update that documentation. Emily: anything on the website is easy to fix, I can update within a day. | . | OpenShadingLanguage adoption Update (Chris) [0:30-0:35] . | Chris: working away at the onboarding process, moving forward smoothly? Larry: the big copyright notice PR was done, license scan was performed. Transferred a couple of domains to ASWF, a bit of delay to CLAs, Pixar rep brought up a legal issue, waiting for the lawyers to decide that the current language is still the right one. Moving quickly on everything. Minimal CLA, identical to the one in the ASWF template, and which is being used by OCIO which was already cleared by Sony / Imageworks legal, would rather avoid having to get that changed, but want to make sure other organizations aren’t prevented from submitting code. | . | OpenEXR Update (Cary) . | We’re hoping for two GSoC students, one to work on the Imath library and one to do some compression benchmarks. -&gt; will likely only be one. | We’re planning a 2.5 release shortly, bug fixes and small features. | John Mertic is having the LF design group mock up some options for a new OpenEXR logo. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion Update (Emily) . | Several names were submitted . | Current contact spreadsheet . | Need to identify a potential chair to lead the effort: ideally the chair person would act as a TSC chair, but with a shorter time commitment. | . | SIGGRAPH (Emily) . | Would like to propose that our Open Source Day is done as a virtual event, either before or after SIGGRAPH. Conference Center in DC may be repurposed for COVID response. Likely that the conference will be cancelled or very low turnout, and overall cost will be lower as well. If SIGGRAPH does go forward in person we can still do some events (TAC BoF for instance), but no individual project BoFs, which would be held during our own virtual event. | Looking for feedback from people who have attended other virtual events. | Daniel: may not be able to fly internationally. Larry: hard to imagine getting on a plane in that timeframe, so makes sense to try to put together the best virtual event we can. | Daniel: there have been a lot of events which have switched to virtual, any positive or negative feedback? Wave: did a big face to face event with the team, pre-recording keynote event and uploading it to a central server for others to watch and then being on Slack while others watched, seemed to go well. So a mix of Zoom / interactive sessions and pre-recorded presentations can be helpful. | Bill: feedback that having a Slack channel to continue the discussion after the presentation helps. Wave: having separate threads per talk also helps to keep track. And can ask questions after the fact. Kimball: also helps for people in different timezones. | Emily: looking at last year, most people didn’t stay for the whole day, will people dedicate a whole day / few hours in the day, or should it be broken up into chunks? . | Wave: his talk was pre-recorded, but then agreed on a time for as many people to “press play” at the same time. Or could be streamed at a specific time? But schedule defined “communal chat time”. | Emily: event team has been putting together a look at available platforms. | Daniel: mitigates the technical risk. | Emily: great for the talks, but more difficult for BoFs which are supposed to be more interactive. Wave: Slack or Discord could work well for that. Nick: prefers Slack, the most annoying events are on Twitch due to visual distractions of the platform. | Eric: IEEE VR conference had issues with Zoom for video distribution. Nick: was really difficult to cross reference between the recording and the Twitch stream. Wave: put the pre-recorded sessions on Box, and everyone had pre downloaded it. | Daniel: what’s the best place to discuss this? We should make some time on the next TAC meeting. | Eric: a big decision is to keep it co-located in time, or moving before or after, Digipro is struggling with this question. Emily: by doing it before or after we gain more flexibility, but can’t benefit from being on the SIGGRAPH schedule. Sean: are there other opportunities for tie-in with SIGGRAPH? Emily: if we do BoF at SIGGRAPH we can use that to promote an event after SIGGRAPH. Will get in touch with ACM to figure out what’s the best way to coordinate. Opportunities to cross promote with Digipro, Pipeline Conference. | Daniel: looks like we have a clear endorsement of the plan to go virtual. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Now that things are settling into some kind of normalcy, we need to keep track of this. | Have been staying in contact with Res, no specific update for now. | . | CI Process: actively working on GPU support, OCIO has moved to GitHub Actions. | Meeting of USD working group should happen in May. | Next meeting . | .

Should definitely be checked with John, conversation to be started on TAC mailing list. | Daniel: are we confident that Docker is the correct approach for those platforms as well? There are other package management systems on those platforms. | Michael: OCIO currently building on all 3 platforms, currently the ASWF Docker containers are really useful for Linux builds. On other platforms only doing minimal installs, using a lot of components from the provided builder VM. Would be very valuable to be able to use Container. | Andrew: GitHub actions may only support Linux containers . | Michael: not a lot of warning when the CI services update compilers or VM OS versions. So don’t have a lot of control over the environment. | Andrew: no specific contacts at MacStadium, but may be possible to find someone to talk to (context is the Orka offering for Docker macOS containers). | Eric: which macOS version do we typically target? Michael: GitHub Actions only supports a small number, 10.15. | Eric: started making Python Wheels to distribute OpenTimelineIO, suggested platform was 10.13 to maximize compatibility, does that apply widely? Michael: on Azure Pipelines were doing 10.13 builds initially, but that got deprecated. | Daniel: some of these issues could be discussed with Wave. | Christina: EXR macOS stopped working as well after an update, would also really like to have Docker (container) images for macOS. Also need to move EXR to GHA. | Daniel: has there been any movement on VFX Platform support for Windows and macOS? Stated goal, but not necessarily specific movement. | . | Packaging / Distribution . | Discussion a year ago: packaging ourselves vs making them “well behaved” by standard packaging systems | . | Testing with commercial components . | Missing a strong candidate with exception of Houdini in OpenVDB | . | . GitHub Actions Migration . | Docker invocation differences to Azure TAC thread . | Aloys: writing a script to manage the environment variables required by GHA. Issues caused by running Docker as root user. | Brian: seems to work for OpenCue, will be helpful to have common infrastructure. | Andrew: no news from GitHub side, “they do everything as root because of how the workspace gets mounted inside the container and you won’t necessarily have rights to that workspace, better to use su / runuser”. Azure Pipelines forced a “user set off root”, and caused problems with Alpine images since it doesn’t have sudo, so they would go back to default Docker behavior. | Aloys: recognized the issue when running the USD unit test, which had a test looking at whether /etc was writable. Looks like we will have to live with this setup long term. So will need to provide helper scripts to change directory owners. | Brian: might be a good idea to use a custom action to check out code and set permissions. | Daniel: is there a mechanism to run actions locally? Andrew: this is an often requested feature, hopefully for later this year.

GHA doesn’t support templates like Azure Pipeines, but 2x the number of concurrent jobs supported, which helped. | Andrew: GHA team is aware of lack of templates, should be able to get organization-level workflow sharing soon. | Andrew: need to look at work done by JF (Terraform) due to secrets sharing issue. Also use of Terraform Cloud may be an issue. JF LF releng can use an S3 bucket as a Terraform backend instead, should simplify things. Andrew: Should be able to be up and running mid next week. | Daniel: let’s set a goal to having some kind of GPU build running by next month’s meeting. | Sean reached out with information about Open Source program, initial request from LF was too large, so being broken up into separate requests. | . Contributors for aswf-docker . | Based on discussion between Daniel and Aloys . | Call for collaborators: robustness and succession plan. This is critical infrastructure for our projects. Many of us are in a position to contribute. | Aloys: hijacked PRs from Brian and Larry due to complexities on how to build packages, currently doing it on his own machine since the workflow is not automated yet. Also need better documentation to make it easier to pick up, write down all the steps required to add a new package. | Adding packages and new releases is still a messy process, we need to move to GHA and automate all the steps, but building some packages cannot be done with free azure/github jobs (clang: 4h build, Qt: 6+h builds, PySide: very long as well) so ideally we get some AWS resources made available when building packages. | Aloys: Started on OSL image / package, reminded him of a few missing steps in the documentation. For instance adding a new year version. | Aloys: once we get more streamlined access to AWS resources this will help with very long running jobs (building Qt can take over 6 hours and runs into job timeouts on Azure Pipelines). | Larry: working his way into it, so far seems to work. Just kicked off a job to try it out further. Appreciate the effort in getting the 2020 images done, that will really help. | Aloys: 2020 images are now as complete as the other images. Only issue has been PyAlembic for Python 3, cannot seem to get it compiled so far. | Larry: should we pull the Alembic crew into it? Getting it to work with Python 3 should be seen as important. | Larry: we should have 2021 images as well, even if we know they are not final, so that projects can start working them into their CI pipelines. The earlier the better. | Larry: it’s also important to have versions with modern compilers, not just the more conservative VFX platform versions. | Aloys: it would be nice to have more compilers available, but may have impact on upstream dependencies. Larry: usually hasn’t seen this a huge problem. It’s useful to try gcc9 / c++ 17 for instance, look for new warnings for instance rather than link compatibility. | Aloys: should be possible to add other devtoolset versions into the images, they are just set with environment variables. A bit more complicated with clang. Larry: will work on a prototype, you can install a number of clang versions in parallel in the same Docker image. | Daniel: there’s been a thread on the vfx-platform mailing list talking about future compiler versions. Interaction between C++ standard version we use to build modules and mandate for the platform, related to the OS C++ standard library and the compiler C++ standard library. Red Hat devtoolset lets you build with more recent compiler by adding the more recent symbols on top of the c++ standard library which shipped with RHEL / CentOS 7, injects a small static library into every build. That introduces some different types of interoperability issues. Are we in supported range of GCC? Supported range of devtoolset? RH explicitly don’t support mixing objects built with different versions of devtoolset. | Daniel: Larry, are you using DTS and the OS-supplied libstdc++, or using clean builds of newer compilers? . | Larry: at work using DTS 6 for the more modern builds, and system compilers (gcc 4.8) for older versions of Maya plugins. For “personal” projects have always used clang for a long time, haven’t run across compatibility issues. There’s a clang flag to specify which version of gcc standard C++ library. Once you do that, you don’t run into too many compatibility projects between clang versions. Understand that RedHat doesn’t want to support too many combinations. | Daniel: with basic precautions, we can use some flexibility in practice. Docker containers are a good way to test out these possible scenarios. | Larry: in CI matrix for OSL and OIIO, test against several compilers (system, clang, llvm), haven’t really run into real problems. | Daniel: request on Aloys part to feel that people should feel free to get involved / contribute to the aswf-docker project. Better / easier automation and documentation will help. | Aloys: used components from aswf-sample-project and OpenEXR. A full TSC is likely overkill. JF is now in CODEOWNERS. Issue with every branch being protected in ASWF GitHub organization: could this be related? CODEOWNERS have special privileges but can’t do a force merge for instance. Andy: TAC voted to allow certain people to have admin rights over certain repositories. Aloys: would it make sense for him to have this over the repo? . | .

We did well for a first year, 3 students will be getting paid for full time work. | Next steps in the court of the mentors in the individual projects. Between now and the end of May is the “getting to know you” period, may be superfluous for us since students have already been involved and understand the project since we did this in the phase where we required students to submit a PR to demonstrate their interest. | Larry: encourage the projects to have the students start working right away if possible. | Later in the summer the mentors will need to grade the students at halfway point and end of summer. | Project leaders should send words of encouragement to students who didn’t get picked, there’s always next year, and contributions are always welcome. | Brian: student proposals can be changed until June 1st, so should review in more details. OpenCue doing a full TSC review of project proposal. | Larry: don’t have to stick exactly to what was proposed, mentor and students can work to rescope proposed. | Mentors can be shuffled around until end of month. | . | ASWF response to COVID-19 (David) [0:15-0:25] . | David: COVID-19 has done lots of damage to the industry, and is changing the way we work. And it’s going to change the world we come back to when it’s over. What do we do about it? . | “COVID-19 mitigation plan” was the first name, but this is an opportunity to get ASWF to the next level. Presented proposal at last week’s Board Meeting, which is up for discussion. | Goals prior to COVID-19 are being put on hold, and replaced with: . | ASWF Phase 2: . | Take care of our own . | Take care of our community . | Double down on our own mission . | . | Take care of our own: 6 month membership extension for all Foundation member companies. | Take care of our own: Engage on planning for ASWF Phase 2 . | Take care of our community: create the ASWF Fund to support open source projects . | Take care of our community: leverage Linux Foundation Community Bridge . | $50K seed funding + $100K matching funds . | TAC has fundamental role to play in defining the kind of projects that would receive grants from ASWF Fund . | Proposal is to start with a $10K grant per quarter . | Try to help people dealing with furloughs, scaling down in companies . | Continue to look into new projects such as USD, remote review / approval project, any other tools we may need in a post COVID-19 world . | Propose to discuss on board and TAC mailing lists. | TAC members should look into the LF Community Bridge site . | Timeline: board has modified meeting schedule, goal is to have plan completed before June 30th. | 2020 continues to be the year of Open Source, this is the opportunity to grow our footprint. | The open source model proved resistant to COVID-19, now is the time to educate our industry to show the advantages of work in the “open source way”. | Daniel: a few meetings back we surveyed how the changes to working process had impacted our projects. At that early stage we felt relatively lucky that most of our key contributors and participants had not been adversely affected. Is that still the case? Apparently so. | Daniel: in other foundations, Community Bridge has been used to fund key contributors, so this could be used in situations where some of our key developers may have lost their primary source of income. For instance projects initially targeting Google SoC that didn’t make the GSoC “cut” could be funded this way. Either Interns or Core Developers. | Daniel: a number of times we’ve discussed that some of our key projects have lacked core capabilities (Windows toolchain for instance), so this could be a good time to identify specific projects that could be tackled. | Henry: when would this be announced publicly so we can start communicating with people? David: if we decide to go ahead with the fund, it will be announced publicly, we need specific criteria to decide how the funds will be allocated. For instance we could have a submission form, list the criteria we are expecting. | Daniel: if for instance there was work not specifically for one of our project, but could make it a better candidate, or another tool that is valuable to the community, that could also be in scope. | JF: should we reuse as much of the GSoC process as possible since it’s proven to work? David: possibly, but don’t want to be too restrictive. Larry: process was put in place in a different context, someone who is known to the community coming from a VFX facility may not require as much vetting. | Larry: our core skills are being able to create good production software in an open source way, is one of the opportunities to think about where does this point us in terms of missing tools or workflows that someone needs to develop. Can we pool our resources to avoid duplication of effort. David: TAC is ideally positioned to focus on this question, we know all the tools and legacy in this industry, the “new world” is going to be a lot more distributed, we need a reinvention of our tools. Larry: Imageworks will have a day to cancel meetings / tickets and be able to work on projects they want to work on, and demo at the end of the day (“hackathon”), and some of the work sometimes ends up being useful to the company. Remote / distributed work could be a good theme for such an event. | . | SIGGRAPH and ASWF events (Emily) [0:25-0:35] . | SIGGRAPH, DigiPro and Pipeline Conference all going virtual. | DigiPro CFP is due Friday, Pipeline Conference in June. One proposal from OpenColorIO. | Do we keep our content as a full day / 2 days, perhaps adjacent to SIGGRAPH, or do we spread it out over multiple weeks, leading up to SIGGRAPH? . | Daniel: biggest factor for outside US is how to accommodate timezones. | Michael Min: is that an argument for spreading vs grouping? Daniel: people interested in a topic can view the recording before the discussion moves on to the next topic. Simultaneity of discussion vs being able to extend to people in other timezones. | Emily: we can also do a live version, and replay in a different timezone with the presenter available to answer questions. | JT: some events have a Slack channel allowing answering of questions in different timezones. | Emily: Slack integration seems to be a common theme / requirement. | Daniel: how are the other side conferences are handling this? Emily: SIGGRAPH is still trying to figure it out. Eric: DigiPro is also having this conversation internally right now. | Wave: attend Realtime Conference which went virtual. Emily: heard good feedback from that conference. We’re working with them to add an open source panel. | Emily: is Digipro still considering a single day event? Eric: no decision made so far, still possible to try to do it in one day, but awkward due to timezones. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion working group (Emily) [0:35-0:45] . | Tracker of people who want to participate https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kuTEhaq7ECJ4ASqGEFnfM0g_919AjYVzZPcpI_e14yc/edit#gid=0 . | Emily: some candidates on the tracker, please ask colleagues who would be interested. Need to identify a potential chair who would lead the group. | Emily: happy to reach out directly to suggested people. | Emily: finding the right person who already has a strong open source background is difficult. This could serve to introduce people to open source. | Larry: do we have a brief introduction to what we are looking for and what we are trying to accomplish so we can send this to people who might be interested? Emily: can put together such a brief / one slid, but will be up to the D&amp;I group to decide on specific goals, and where they will want to focus. | . | Working Group Updates [0:45-0:50] . | CI Working Group . | Good progress on bringing GPU build agents into production usage for OpenColorIO, which is the targeted first project. Turn prototype into something that delivers value to our projects. | Looking at the other long term goals: cross platform builds, support in a more consistent manner than we have so far, each project has taken different paths so far. | Michael: not much change since last week, but OCIO has fully moved to GitHub Actions, Andy from LF releng working on getting accounts set up with AWS, once that’s in place we can turn the prototype work into a production tool. JF to collaborate with OCIO, goal is to be up and running in 2 weeks at next CI meeting. | . | USD Working Group . | Scheduled meeting in 2 weeks. | Cory: cautiously heading back into the process. We had to put a proposal forward, do we need a TAC vote to accept this? . | Daniel: we need a TAC sponsor, do we need a vote? . | John: do we need a vote because the WG doesn’t exist yet? Don’t recall if the discussions got to that stage yet. | Cory: we’ll try to schedule the meeting for next Wednesday, and come back to the TAC the following week, but want to figure out if there’s an official “hurdle” for the TAC to approve. John: will go back to the process document. David: ASWF is committed to help USD as one of the very important projects in the industry, and wants to help if it can. We want to confirm what are the “goals and non goals”. | Daniel: will confer with Cory and John to clarify what was previously discussed / decided. | . | . | Technical Project updates [0:50-0:55] . | OpenShadingLanguage induction . | Chris: in a bit of a holding pattern, waiting for proposed changes to the CLA by Pixar, most of the other steps have been completed. So waiting for CLA update before proposing “incubation stage”. | Daniel: is this the same issue as for OpenTimelineIO? Larry: yes, same issue, there’s one sentence that may have implications on sibling companies owned by the same corporate parent. Legal folks are talking to each other to try to resolve it. Chris: as a result of this there may be an updated CLA that might trickle down to other projects. Larry: trying to get it right to avoid needing contributors to sign an updated CLA after the fact. | Daniel: are you getting all the support you need from ASWF? Chris: yes, believe so, “the lawyers are talking to the lawyers”. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 20 May 2020 | . | . ",

The TSCs should have the scope to decide for themselves. So the default position would be no recording, but TSCs can decide otherwise. | Michael: OCIO has never recorded their TSC meetings, will stick with that position. | Cary: OpenEXR hasn’t recorded their TSC meetings either, sometimes wish could playback through discussion when writing notes after the fact, but there is value to discussions being “off the moment”, may affect the tone if you know what you are saying is being recorded. | Nick: OTIO frequently has vendors in attendance, who don’t want to take on fiduciary responsibility to commit to features. | Larry: similar comment, perpetuity of recording has an influence | John: should make sure that TSC meetings aren’t the right place to discuss features of commercial products, want to make sure not to run into antitrust issues | Daniel: so default position for TAC and TSCs is no recording, unless a specific TSC wants to override that | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenEXR . | IMath separation | Cary: Starting with Google Summer of Code intern, set up a weekly check in to touch base. Nature of project is that Owen may “burn through” the project scope fairly quickly, but may also end up running into unforeseen complications. So better to stick to the official timeline with 30hrs/week in early June. | Set up a spreadsheet to break down tasks as a lesson in project management, seems to be going well. | Got another ping yesterday from the Google autofuzz project, which had approached us last year to add OpenEXR to their regular schedule. At the time we had declined due to concern with the volume of potential reports for obscure bugs. This could be construed as us taking a position on security (not taking it seriously)? We may not have the resources to respond to this in a timely way. Security may be less of a concern for many ASWF projects (running behind the firewall). But some projects such as OpenEXR are part of operating systems. | Nick: the 30 day “ticking clock” nature of the system (being put on a “shame list”) would be a problem given project resources. | OpenEXR is part of the macOS ImageIO framework, used throughout the OS. A lot of the early security fixes in OpenEXR were based on internal fuzzing by Apple. | Would this be an “endless trickle” or a “tsunami” of reports? | Gordon: half a person over 1 year for FBX issues that came up when it was included in Windows | Cary: “500 cores for 2 weeks” thrown at EXR: the “obvious” stuff might have already been caught, and those issues were already mostly dealt with. | Larry: how good are they at accepting “won’t fix / false positive”? Cary: 6 issues were submitted last week that were garbled, issue title didn’t match the stack traces. Issue was caused by using an uninstrumented standard library, which turned out to be a false positive. | Daniel: how official is the “won’t fix” process? Nick: Debian had reported a bunch of issues, OpenEXR declined to fix some of those. Cary: what’s to stop the fuzzer from reporting the same issue again? | Gordon: there’s a difference between a true “won’t fix” and “this isn’t a real issue” | Nick: Would still be preferable to have our own approach. As an organization we should have a set of standards we adopt, but not necessarily comfortable with OpenEXR being “out on its own” with regards to Google fuzzer. | Daniel: desire to make this decision carefully that can be generalized across projects, and lack of knowledge about the implications. We could resolve the lack of knowledge issue by signing up OpenEXR, and make it as part of our second stage of CII badge which adds dynamic fuzzing as a requirement. | Cary: will follow up with Google to get more information on the process. | Daniel: perhaps there’s a different service we could use instead. | Cary: these vulnerabilities aren’t just relevant to ASWF and member companies, the issues mostly affect use of OpenEXR outside our community. | Gordon: from a tool provider side, need to worry about security issues even in this space, especially given use in the cloud, and investing quite a bit into security. | Eric: is there written documentation on the IMath split? Cary: general outline sent to the OpenEXR mailing list. Would be worth publishing on the OpenEXR web site. Follow on is a large modernization of the repo (const_expr, CUDA compatibility…) | Daniel: also a useful thread on OpenVDB mailing list about adding Half Float data type to C++ standard | . | OpenColorIO . | Documentation revamp | OpenColorIO-Config-ACES repo: meeting with ACES leadership to clarify relationship between OCIO and ACES, issues of licensing. Started new repo OpenColorIO-Config-ACES under ASWF organization, will work in collaboration with ACES, revamping distribution plan for official OCIO configs. | Will establish WGs for official OCIO configs, also opportunity for studios to contribute configs to leverage infrastructure being put in place. Daniel: interesting model for not-quite-software distribution. License will be the same BSD 3 Clause than OCIO, there’s typically a Python library included to do things like generate LUTs. | Michael: the CI will be dependant on build artifacts, want to make those artifacts available for download. | Michael: two new members to TSC, Carol and Sean working on a documentation revamp for V2, need to revamp the content and structure of the documentation, new website as well. Looking at different solutions, reaching out to community for feedback. Also working with Emily to leverage what can be reused from Linux Foundation. | GPU build project: Andy from releng still working on infrastructure needed on the lf-releng side, organizing AWS account is a bit complicated, but should have something to report at CI meeting next week. | . | OpenShadingLanguage . | adoption process | Still waiting on clarifications about CLA. | Larry: last TSC meeting was almost all about technical instead of administrative issues, which is good progress | . | . | Working groups . | USD . | Group has resumed activity. Cory: had a good meeting with good attendance. Discussed stated goals and non-goals, agreed that they were appropriate. Discussed the deliverables. | USD Working Group GitHub Repository : deliverables, meeting schedule, meeting notes | Daniel: CI working group “spontaneously” created, the USD WG is the first one with a somewhat more formal process. Process was inherited from CNCF, TAC should vote on endorsing the USD working group. Daniel: proposal for WG was merged into TAC repo. | Working Group Process Document including endorsement by the TAC | Daniel: it may be a bit hurried to vote on this TAC meeting? Otherwise we’ll do a vote by email to keep things moving. | Cory: will start doing the announcements on the USD interest mailing list to reach out to a wider audience. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Emily working on identifying the right people to move | Carol Payne from Netflix and Rachel Rose from ILM will co-chair, had a call last week to discuss plans | Will make official proposal to the TAC soon, discuss specifics like term limits, TSC structure… | Send overview document to the TAC | . | Python 3 . | Henry Vera from DNeg brought Ashley Whetter onto the call, leading internal Python 3 effort at DNeg. | Next step will be to have a small number of formation meetings to determine goals / non goals and come back to TAC with proposal | Daniel started the process going, handing off to Henry and Ashley | . | . | ASWF fund, grants . | Looking to establish a presence in the Linux Foundation Community Bridge system to identify projects of interest to our community and potentially grant funds to support those projects. | Can we identify projects where funding would help with development? | Could the original VES Tech Committee document identifying OSS projects in VFX be used as a source? | Daniel: typically an existing project will identify a need for a key developer, and use Community Bridge to seek support for that developer. Second approach would be more open ended, for instance articulating needs for remote review, and seeing whether this mechanism could be used to get to a solution. | Is this similar to the “Google Summer of Code”? Could we look at funding some of the students ourselves? | Daniel: does the TAC think this is a valid mechanism for the goals of the TAC / ASWF, and also look at the at the specifics. | John: can share experience from other foundations. Somewhat wider scope than GSoC, lots of models of how it could be used. David had talked about establishing a fund / grant program, but there are other options as well. | Daniel: we probably need more time / offline discussion, will work with John to work out specific examples. | . | Vote on USD working group . | JF is moving to endorse USD WG | Daniel seconds | All Yeah, no abstain or reject | Adopted unanimously, first officially endorsed WG | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting: 3 June 2020 | .

Because of use of stateful Terraform, this is a problem. Also need a DynamoDB for S3 lock files, hence the suggestion for AWS CodeBuild. Will also allow consumption of ASWF Docker containers directly. CodeBuild has an option for requesting a GPU container, so should be possible to translate the PoC into CodeBuild. Will need to create a CodeBuild project. | Drawback is lock-in to AWS, whereas Terraform-based approach worked on multiple clouds. | Daniel: this only becomes a real concern when the amount of configuration in CodeBuild becomes non-trivial. Have used CodeBuild tangentially as a way to bring AWS into internal CI build pool, but will be migrating away due to limitations placed on machine image and mount points, so moving back to working on raw VMs (Animal Logic). Andrew: seems to be able to run on raw machine images. | . | . | GitHub Secrets at Org level (JF) . | https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/message/1444 | Andrew: SonarCloud token converted to an organizational token, each ASWF project becomes a separate “project” under the SonarCloud ASWF organization, OpenEXR has two since it runs two separate scans. This happens automatically for Java projects. | LF releng will create SonarCloud project for each new project. | . | Shared Templates for GitHub Actions . | Andrew: no movement from Microsoft so far | Aloys: main reason why aswf-docker is still on Azure Pipelines, since it uses templates a lot. Could possibly use Matrix instead. | Andrew: some frustration in releng team on lack of support for templates. One of the first things discussed in monthly meeting with Microsoft. | Daniel: could ASWF also try to mention our need for this functionality to Microsoft? | . | GitHub Actions docker support for non-Linux OS? (Daniel) . | Not directly? https://github.community/t/container-based-actions-from-mac-and-windows/16821 | . | Windows . | Proof of concept of building Windows container with GitHub Actions and WIndows version supported by GHA (JF) . | Containers not currently supported by GHA on Windows or Mac build hosts | Would need additional steps (custom GHA builders?) | JF: no progress this month, but still committed to try this | . | LF releng has not pushed Windows containers to a repo yet, have not run anything non-proprietary in the infrastructure they manage. Conversation started on TAC mailing list. (Andrew) . | Microsoft doing a lot do making Windows more container / cloud friendly. Reference an external base image, container gets instantiated on a machine that has the proper Windows license. | Daniel: Aloys, do you see issues with creating containers layered on top of a reference image? Not clear, haven’t done much investigation so far. Should organizations that need to use Windows contribute more on this front? | JF: is it worth trying to make the aswf-docker project multi-platform? Aloys: should look pretty much the same, structure should be pretty similar, would make sense. Mac should look pretty similar. Larry: could use bash scripts on WSL | Daniel: all projects are doing Windows and macOS somehow, but not as nice a Linux, want to be able to leverage common infrastructure. Larry: want to get rid of the repetition and possible errors as Linux-centric developers try to cut-n-paste Linux code in the Windows/Mac build infrastructure. | Daniel: consensus seems to be that what we get from aswf-docker is what we would want to emulate on other platforms. Commonality is a big goal. | JF: could the configuration encapsulated in the aswf-docker repo be broken out into a separate repo to be consumed by other projects that need to know the required component versions for the ASWF / VFX Reference Platform environment? | . | . | Mac . | Stability of Mac OS VM versions on GHA . | An issue for OpenEXR / OCIO: difficult to keep your CI system stable as the macOS version is quickly upgraded on CI system builders | An argument for container-based build system | . | Docker alternatives on Mac (Wave) . | Daniel in contact with some people at Apple, how to address build stability vs staying up to date. | . | MacStadium / Orka (JF, Andy) | Code signing becoming more and more important on macOS platform if we want to distribute binaries? | Andrew: LF does not have an infrastructure for building signed macOS apps. At present no infrastructure for acquiring code signing certificates. | Daniel: does Artifactory offer this kind of infrastructure? Andrew: some support for signing artifacts at release time, but no support for code signing macOS binaries AFAIK. | Andrew: code signing is possible in a public / open source project, but may not be doing the code signing in a public CI system, typically small projects where an individual developer would do the code signing manually. | Andrew: LF runs an application called Sigul developed by the Fedora project to sign builds, that’s how LF releng signs Java artifacts and RPMs, ISO files. Current version based on Python 2.7 / CentOS 7, currently working at LF releng to start supporting Python 3. | Daniel: would be good to gather any info on open source projects that are doing code signing. | LF releng investigating whether Hashicorp Vault would be a good service to offer projects, could be used to store certificates. There is a plugin that brings some of the functionality in Sigul into Vault. Could be the only way to offer code signing in multi-cloud environments. | . | ASWF-docker updates . | Newer compiler testing (e.g. GCC 9) / testing for VFXPlatform 2021 (Aloys) . | Aloys: ci-common includes the base packages including DTS-6 in v1, v2 now includes DTS-9 including gcc 9 and clang 10 as a proposal. We don’t know yet what VFX Platform 2021 will include. Started building as many components as possible. CUDA 10 currently doesn’t support gcc 9, but CUDA 11 should support gcc 9 (coming soon). | Aloys: about to submit PR against aswf-docker for gcc 9 support, will need to patch Qt, OCIO fails with some new warnings, some CUDA-related build failures. But should be testable for OSL soon. Larry: would love to try it. Aloys: 2021 tentative image should have same content dependencies as previous years. OpenEXR seems to be fine. | Larry: have you contemplated being able to test against matrix of different llvms (important for OSL)?. Not a VFX Platform mandate, but important for OSL. Aloys: should be fine, LLVM is pretty big (1GB), so adding multiple LLVMs to image would become big. Larry: not using the LLVM in the container anyway, so shouldn’t be an issue. Aloys: compiling clang against DTS provided libraries. Aloys: resolved some space limitation issues on build machines by uninstalling OS components that are not required. Larry: uses pre-packaged Ubuntu packages. | Aloys: select clang 7 somewhat arbitrarily, experience with it at AL, and clang 10 as “latest”. Now clear how many versions should be best? Larry: there’s a range of clang versions that OSL tries to support (currently supports 7-8-9-10, used to support only current and previous, but LLVM has increased release cadence). | Daniel: does using DTS pre-built versions of clang toolchain make this more straightforward? | Larry: being able to find pre-built clang versions would help limit OSL CI build times. | Daniel: new mechanism in RedHat called “Software Collections” for software packaging to support parallel versions, use “scl” command to instantiate environment. | Larry: simple to have multiple clang / LLVM versions in parallel without interference with system compilers. | . | Aloys: Working on documentation and release process. Creating a tag should trigger the build and deployment (83 different images can be built from single repo, will be even more with 2021 builds). Currently managing all these releases is somewhat manual, so trying to automate / formalizing it. | . | . Project Specific Goals / Problems . | USD-WG goal (Daniel) . | “Cross-platform build recipes / CI for USD” | USD Working Group Meeting Notes 13-May-2020 | Daniel: propose that we make our CI system and docker images a way to help people build USD. Aloys has already sent some initial emails to usd-interest mailing list. | Sean: offering resources from release engineering at AWS to help Aloys. Asking Aloys to provide some info on where he could use some help. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | ASWF Grants and Fund . | Project areas? | . | Events (Emily) . | SIGGRAPH . | Moving to mid-August, no set date yet. | . | Open Source Day / Week . | ASWF Open Source Day will be a 2 day event, were going to do it Thu-Fri before SIGGRAPH, but now TBD . | Reached out to Digipro (Saturday?) and Pipeline Conference (Sunday?) to coordinate . | Every project to give updates, inviting outside projects such as Res, MaterialX, USD . | Inviting studio execs to discuss how the projects are used . | Use cases / production examples, keep interesting / more visual . | Updates are going to be 30 minutes only (because of virtual attendance) . | Working on platform, Zoom based, meeting form vs webinar form. Talking to Real Time Conference as well to see how they are doing things. | Looking at a ASWF BoF followed by a TAC BoF during SIGGRAPH itself. | Talk on OCIO submitted and accepted to Digipro . | Pipeline Conference CFP is due this Friday (5-June-2020) if anyone wants to propose something. | Putting together a brief organizer template / guideline for the project updates, not prescriptive but can be useful. | . | . | Working Groups . | Branching out on multiple fronts . | CI Working Group (Daniel) . | CI working group getting into mechanics of provisioning GPU runners, relies on the LF release engineering group . | Starting to look at Mac and Windows build problems, in particular . | New VFX Reference Platform aswf-docker Docker containers . | RedHat Developer Toolset 9, discovered bug (compiler crash) in gcc 9, fixed in gcc 9.3.1, waiting for official build for CentOS (important for OSL) . | Looks promising, will support C++ 17 . | Validates the approach of using Docker images in our infrastructure to test upcoming versions of the VFX Reference Platform. | New containers also have clang 10 and llvm 10, useful for testing. | Michael: heard from Andy at LF releng that the open issue for GPU builders is getting resolved. | Windows / Mac: good opportunity for someone with expertise in those areas to get involved in the CI working group. | Wave: someone in developer relations who is familiar with CI systems has volunteered to get involved, will have time after Apple Developer Conference . | . | USD Working Group (Cory) . | Suggestions for initiatives: . | A public Wiki to share best practices, how to structure assets . | Started discussion to John to look at how contributions could look like. | Full suite of USD tests running in GitHub, what it would it take to transition test suites currently running in Azure Pipelines, would use GPU instances . | NVIDIA reaching out to see how they could help with lack of good image diffing tools . | . | Meet again next week . | Michael Min: some members had concerns of how to work with Pixar to get approval for all contributions. Will the WG always be gated by Pixar? Having to get approval for everything would limit the usefulness. | Cory: the WG is trying to help the Pixar USD team, so it’s important to keep the USD Team in the loop to make sure that initiatives are helpful. But don’t expect that every activity of the WG has to be approved by USD team. But wanted to make sure any WG initiatives aren’t “competing” with work being done or scheduled by USD team. | . | Python 3 Working Group . | Doodle poll for WG meeting time | . | D&amp;I Working Group . | Emily: should have formal submission in a week | . | . | Project Updates . | OpenEXR . | Fuzz testing . | Carey: had TSC meeting two week ago, invited two representatives from OSS-Fuzz project to join and discuss the service. Their presence was very helpful, put a lot of fears to rest. | OpenEXR agreed to sign up, one hour of work to do. Low key process. | OpenEXR has already had a lot of fuzzing testing, don’t expect a torrent of new reports. Bugs get reported privately, have 90 days to fix them before public notification, which looks doable. | Assumption is that reported bugs are easily reproduced with test cases / datasets. | Going from test case to fix has typically been pretty simple: integer overflow for instance, just needs a change of type. So doesn’t feel like we are signing up for a large amount of work. | Kimball: as we get more of a corpus of test cases, we probably need a regression test repository of problematic images. | Large repo of binary files, could be a separate section of the openexr-images repo, or a separate repo? There are already some “garbage images” in the openexr-images repo which should be integrated in the test suite. | Daniel: Openexr-images repo is still a separate repo, is it a sub repo? Carey: currently completely separate, have been intending to revamping it. Has not been moved into ASWF GitHub organization, still under the openexr organization, which needs to be closed. | Carey: got a report of a couple of bugs from someone at a security lab in Beijing, reporting a vulnerability. There was a test case, reproduced and fixed it. The reporter requested that OpenEXR requests a CVE so it can be tracked. But it sounds like this is an organization that may be looking for bug bounties, brings up the question of previous instances of people reporting bugs and filing CVEs. But first time someone has requested we file one ourselves. Wrote a summary and reached out to Dan Hutchinson at The Foundry (who had presented on security a year ago). Gordon: Autodesk has internal security team, has had to file CVEs, had issues reported against Maya and FBX. Can ask Autodesk team for an opinion / review. Carey: asking for confirmation that this is the right way to go about it. Gordon: Microsoft has filed a few CVEs against FBX (they do a lot of testing), then asked Autodesk to create them. CVE likes specific language in reports. Carey: will write to Autodesk team. | Owen Thomson, GSoC intern, first day of full time work was Monday. | . | OpenShadingLanguage Adoption . | Chris: no update, still in holding pattern. | Larry: upcoming governing board / legal subcommittee meeting where this is supposed to be discussed, hoping for an agreement on the CLA language. | John: some language issues were raised by Disney legal counsel with the CLA used by most of our projects (except OpenCue which uses the Apache CLA). Bringing concerns to legal committee (next week), will discuss and come up with a recommendation. This may result in requests to each TSC / TSC chairs to potentially amend terms of CLA. Is a change to CLA retroactive? Depends on the nature of the change to the CLA. | Larry: we didn’t make contributors to projects before joining the ASWF sign a new CLA for old contributions. John: yes, this is not (typically) retroactive. | . | OpenCue Incubation Status . | Daniel: according to our project lifecycle process, supposed to have annual review of projects in incubation, discuss and review progress. So good idea to have a conversation on this topic. | Brian: OpenCue has been making progress on this, discussed this on last TSC meeting which was joined by John. A few months ago identified some issues, in particular diversity and static analysis. Some progress on diversity, but not much progress on static analysis, have been focussing more on test coverage aspect rather than issues reported by static analysis tool. Should have more to report at next TAC meeting. | . | . | Qt licensing changes . | Gordon: Maya is currently trying to navigate changes the Qt Company are making to their licensing. Removing Long Term Support from their open source offering. Historically Maya has used the open source version, studios have dependencies for their own in-house tools. Pinged the VFX Reference Platform team, no announcement / decision on this topic. Maya will have to make a difference sooner rather than later: should Maya move to commercial version, or stick with open source version. | Should we collectively decide what to do: stick to open source version with no long term maintenance, maintain our own branch? . | Henry: started looking at options internally after discussion with Autodesk. A lot of internal software based on Qt. Decent sized R&amp;D team that would require commercial licenses. No decision yet, but leaning towards open source version. Most facilities are using Qt for their internal software in one way or another. | Daniel: Qt is open source but the repository is not very open to contributions. So even if you want to fix a bug, it’s not clear if the fix will be accepted back to the main branch, so maintaining an open source branch would be a fork. | Gordon: Maya has been trying to move back to a “vanilla” version of Qt, had been making good progress feeding fixes back to main repo. Complicated discussions because of different ownership structure between the commercial and open source versions. We need a series of possible approaches to deal with this. Perhaps if the industry is leaning away from their version, that might have an influence on the Qt Company? . | Gordon: Autodesk does have a commercial license for some of the components such as the installer. Autodesk will have to make decision sooner than the larger group. | Sean: should we start a group dedicated to this topic? Gordon: would be interested, are there enough people interested? . | Nick: on the USD project, spend some time to help people who try to integrate Qt work into USD, may no longer accept these contributions if the Qt / PyQt license becomes too complex. | Gordon: agreed, preference for open source version. | Kimball: we probably shouldn’t worry about support, we don’t apply that criteria to other open source components we use. | Nick: definitely prefer to have a single version of Qt / PyQt to support. | Daniel: Autodesk and SideFX were maintaining patches against Qt for a long time to fix certain issues, for instance Wacom support, where changes weren’t being accepted back into the main repo. Want to be able to share the exact source that Maya is building against, and make sure to stick to the license. Keen to be on a common version. | Henry: facilities pushed Maya to try to adopt vanilla version of Qt . | Kimball: VFX Reference Platform specified patches against Qt in previous years . | Daniel: haven’t looked yet at the reaction of the KDE community, which is the main user of Qt. | Daniel: do we agree that the open source version remains the preferred version? Should we have the discussion just within the TAC, or with a wider audience? Happy to lead that discussion. | John: is the discussion more on the legal/business or developer side? Gordon: legal / business side. | John: LF happy to help within limits of its mandate. | Larry: not clear about “compatibility” issues. If commercial products selected the commercial version, would it create a compatibility gap between those who have a commercial license and those who don’t? . | Gordon: 1 year of support gets mostly burned away just by transition to new version. API changes (headers) would not be able to be redistributed, and can’t get security fixes. | John: any of our current projects directly impacted? Larry: OSL uses Qt but just for a small thing. Brian: all GUI components written with PySide, same for OTIO. Also we include Qt in our Docker images (aswf-docker project). | Daniel: we can discuss on the TAC mailing list what are the next steps. | . | Next meeting . | 17 June 2020 | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Streamlined Slack self-invite workflow: ASWF Slack Login . | New member welcome: Sean O’Connell (AMD) . | On the software performance engineering team . | Optimize ISV benchmarks and applications for all server and desktop CPUs . | . | OpenCue Incubation review . | Process reference: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/master/process/lifecycle.md . | Checklist on how the project is developing . | Is the graduation imminent or still hurdles to overcome . | How can we help the project along if needed . | Brian: getting close to going for graduation, everything looking good, probably need another couple of months to complete the CII requirements. | Daniel: the question of accurately gauging project usage in the community can be tricky. | Brian: it’s a question that’s applicable to all Open Source projects, Google is used to having detailed telemetry / information on user base, but we don’t have that in OpenCue, and haven’t found a good way to get this information without hitting privacy issues. Other ASWF projects haven’t had to deal with this so much since they are clear industry standards. | JT: Pasadena Open Source is planning to keep OpenCue as part of the promoted software stack, including all ASWF projects. Planning a press release, have exposure with close association with the Blender project. | Larry: in the process of switching over from internal predecessor (cue3) at SPI . | Daniel: Does anyone have expertise on how to deal with open source user base information gathering? Larry: open source authors are always somewhat guessing, “begging” for feedback. Sometimes hear through the grapevine, sometimes through industry article (FXGuide). But most info is by luck, probably under counting. John: also should figure out goals, users vs studios. Some projects will enable a way for companies to opt-in to a way to state that a company is a user. Example from one of the CNCF projects, Envoyproxy. they collect a data file that companies can opt in (added as a commit). Often you need to get some kind of legal review. | Brian: sounds like something that could be easy / low overhead to put in place. | Daniel: a ASWF-level survey could also yield useful information. | Brian: will present data at the next meeting gathered from OpenCue public channels. | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenShadingLanguage adoption . | Legal Committee meeting . | Chris: seems like things are pointing back to Apache CLA, which is where things originally started at. Lawyers are currently re-reviewing that CLA. Hopefully will have positive info to report at next TAC meeting. | John: this could possibly have impact on all ASWF projects. | Larry: do we have any confidence that the next company that has large contributions to make won’t also ask for major revisions? How can we be confident that “we’ve got this nailed”? . | John: these things are never completely bullet proof, as case law evolves things change over time in OSS, trying to follow best practices. High desire to achieve this result of a framework acceptable to all / most companies. | Daniel: we have been trying to take steps towards the more standard and broadly used licenses, processes and terms, and encourage our member companies and contributors to accept those rather than require custom terms. | . | OpenEXR / IlmBase / Math Library . | Cary: new repos are setup, code ported over and building. | Set up GitHub project and issues to host discussion, strategies about modernizing exception handling . | Daniel: very good discussion on ways to make use of various recent C++ features, but still try to minimize / prevent API changes. | Cary: the more disruptive the changes, the more carefully they need to be vetted. “Anything” is on the table, but disruption to existing code requires strong arguments in favor. | Kimball: cleaning up the OpenEXR repo itself will lead to questions to the group about how they deal with their dependencies. | Cary: Owen is working out great, he’s a great asset. | Larry: would like to hear feedback from other projects on GSoC interns. | Cary: 30 min checking once a week, same for Kimball, plus TSC weekly meeting, and daily email contact, so good engagement. | Daniel: towards the end we may want to review the process. Cary: we have to file a progress report end of June and July, payment is contingent on that. Will share info on what is required of this report. | . | OpenTimelineIO: great start, got close to the finish line, following the proposed schedule. | OpenCue: also good progress, aligning with the schedule, looking great so far. | OpenColorIO . | Moving towards V2 release . | Michael: spun up 2 WGs, one to redo documentation / website, and creating a standard ACES / OCIO config. | Successful, involvement from new contributors, weekly or bi-weekly meetings. | . | . | Working Groups . | Process: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/master/process/working_groups.md . | CI . | No meeting since last TAC call . | Progress on getting AWS / GPU builds. | Michael: OCIO will work on this next week . | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Rachel Rose (ILM), first D&amp;I meeting just before this one. | Not a lot to report yet after first meeting, great turnout with 39 attendees, with good diversity. | First half of meeting was self introductions, what people were looking for. Many newcomers to these activities or ASWF itself. | Second half was brainstorming as to what the group is hoping to accomplish. Engage with college-level students, as well as younger children interested in Open Source. | Many conversations around education, skills for negotiation and promotions, rise in the ranks of industry. | Discussions around codes of conduct. | We should be doing more things like Summer of Code to pull in a wider group of people, giving them projects to work on. | Hoping for a second meeting next week or the week after to establish concrete goals. Will send out survey to determine next date. | Emily: large desire for mentorship, asking project TSCs to identify what students could work on, both code and documentation, will be useful when ASWF launches mentorship program. | Template to be shared with TAC, vote to endorse the WG . | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: kickoff meeting, set up GitHub repo and mailing list. | Discussing the direction the group wants to follow and “mission statement”. Information sharing to help the transition to Python 3, reducing risk as well as specific technical processes. | Looking for a TAC member sponsor (Daniel: voting member of the TAC who can endorse / propose the working group, doesn’t necessarily have to be the chair of the WG, Daniel happy to be that person). | Looking to get more (DCC) vendor representation within the group. | Proposed WG statement . | Daniel: are we ready to vote on the endorsement of the WG? . | Daniel sponsors, Kimball proposes, seconded by Henry. No opposes or abstain, unanimous, Python 3 WG is endorsed. | Daniel: will reach out to DCC vendors to invite representation to the WG. | . | USD . | Cory: had a really good meeting, well attended, a bunch of pre-work was done to identify categories for knowledge base. Spent most of the session reviewing those. Well underway, trying to materialize into GitHub Wiki. Comments that GitHub Wiki may quickly become a bottleneck, and Confluence may be a better platform, will reach out to John to see if that’s possible. | Didn’t spend time on the USD CI yet, will spend more time on that once the documentation infrastructure is in place . | Next meeting on Wednesday . | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Open Source Day - Emily . | SIGGRAPH is likely to be last week of August, so we are targeting August 12-13 2020. | Using Zoom platform, similar lineup to last year, sessions around 30 minutes, 7AM to 2PM Pacific (not great for Australia). | MaterialX, ACES, as well as ASWF projects . | Use case presentations from studios . | Can present talks about specific use of projects in production . | Will start working on formalizing format . | Save the date! . | Daniel: what about Beers of a Feather? Is there any way we can encourage informal discussions? . | Emily: there is crossover with the D&amp;I WG on how to encourage involvement / contribution. | Larry: would be great if some of the new contributors in D&amp;I WG could participate to Open Source Day . | Wave: documents on “how to get involved” can be really useful. Larry: we should have ready answers available for “how do I get involved” . | Wave: does LF have any such resources from its other projects / foundations? Can be as trivial as “How to I make my first PR?”. Emily: should be able to find something across the LF. | Larry: as part of GSoC proposal, every project identified good issues to start with. | Rachel: D&amp;I group could be a good place to collate / prioritize this info . | Wave: not only developers can be mentors . | Daniel: is new documentation for OCIO able to bring in a wider range of contributors? Michael: trying to approach from perspective of not just writing the documentation for developers, but also integrators, artists, TDs… Documentation goes from “shallow” to “deep”, targeting different types of users. Also trying to set up documentation to argue for a wider base of contributors. | Emily: LF has Confluence, what else? John: projects go in many different directions for documentation. Some incorporate it close to the code. Andy working on spinning up a Confluence server. | John: LF course on contributing to Open Source . | John: some LF projects go down the path of building a training course, sometimes using the EdX platform. Doesn’t take the place of actual documentation, but can be worth exploring to broaden the user base / engagement. | Emily: k8s has good info on maintaining documentation . | Michael: notes on OCIO documentation WG is in the repo . | Emily: we need to set D&amp;I goals for the TAC so we can measure against those goals and measure progress. | Daniel: there is a mailing list and Slack channel . | . | VFX Platform (Larry) . | The VFX Platform just published its 2021 Draft specifications. Highlight #1 is that it’s moving to gcc 9.3 and C++17 (and, as we already knew, Python 3.7) – so let that be warning to projects to start preparing, as well as getting these cases into their CI. Highlight #2 is that they named OCIO v2.0 and OpenEXR 3.0 for 2021, despite the fact that both are still in progress and not released yet (how’s that for lighting a fire under them?). | Nick: To be clear this is just the Draft for next year so please send feedback if you would prefer a different version for anything. We have around 4-6 weeks before we start locking in versions so we have a final target everyone can work towards. We are actively considering changing Python to 3.8 so please shout if you have opinions… | . | Next meeting . | 1 July 2020 | . | . ",

    "content": "ASWF CI Goals for Year 2 . | GPU Build &amp; Test (Close to production on OCIO) | Mac, Windows &amp; Linux (New focus) | Packaging / Distribution | Testing with commercial components | . Follow ups . | GPU Resources . | OCIO request for AWS setup JIRA ticket (Andy) | Michael: OCIO started working on this yesterday, set up credentials for AWS CodeBuild, working on build specs for CodeBuild to replicate OCIO builds. Will then work with Andy to get project set up. Seems with the integration in GitHub Actions, it will be straightforward, no need for multi-stage jobs to spin up and tear down GPU server. Passes many GitHub variables to CodeBuild side, a bit more manual management of grabbing the right commits from the PR branch. | Andy: will also need to explicitly pass any secrets required, but no need of secrets for the AWS side. | Michael: hoping to have something running by the end of this week. Andy: we will then have a template for adding to other projects. | Daniel: USD WG was looking at what value could be added with ASWF CI, a mechanism they could use directly to run their test suite which is GPU dependent. Also discussed running CI on the code snippets / example code we might have in the WG repository. | JF: should this leverage ASWF docker container, or USD “top of trunk”? Daniel: depends on the use case, is it meant to demonstrate code running against a USD release, or meant to augment the USD test suite? | Aloys: submitted a PR to build USD against Azure Pipelines last year with ccache support. Has not been merged yet. Builds in 16 minutes. USD may consider moving to GitHub Actions. | . | Windows . | Proof of concept of building Windows container with GitHub Actions and WIndows version supported by GHA (JF) | JF: no movement there, no support for Windows container builds on GitHub Actions at this time. Andrew: that is correct. Also GPU is supported with CodeBuild only on Linux, including containers. Would need explicit instance management for Windows GPU, not currently supported by AWS CodeBuild (no GPU available on Windows). | Daniel: would using AWS CodeBuild be another way for us to have more control over Windows CI? Andrew: CodeBuild on Windows currently doesn’t support GPU or containers. | USD, OSL make GPU on Windows more important, OCIO’s requirement was originally mostly satisfied by GPU on Linux. | . | Mac . | MacStadium / Orka | Code Signing? | Apple Silicon . | Larry: any announcements from GitHub about ARM macOS instances? OSL is very Intel oriented, will need significant effort to get good ARM support. | No announcements about CI / resources | Larry: Travis started offering non-x86 instances, some ARM varieties. | Graviton instances in AWS CodeBuild? Sean: there is documentation that seems to indicate there is. May need to have access Graviton instances added to ASWF / LF Releng account. This would be ARM builds on Linux, but would lay the groundwork for ARM builds on macOS. | Larry: gcc / clang / llvm does support ARM | macOS will support dual architecture binaries as well as Intel emulation via Rosetta2 | Sean: AWS has several projects to support Graviton, so definite interest there. | Will macOS 11 still support OpenGL? What about Metal / Vulkan? | . | Discussion on Xcode version on VFX Platform mailing list | . | ASWF-docker updates . | Git v2 . | Done by Brian | Not released every new Docker image yet, only the ci-opencue images, waiting on feedback to release the others | Ensures that you end up with a working git repo inside the container (otherwise v2 of the “checkout” GitHub Action only does a copy of the code tree) | New images are working, haven’t tested the functioning git repo part yet, but will do so tomorrow. | Git v2.18 still behind the current version 2.28, but that’s the version supported by RedHat Software Collections. | Andrew: IUS yum repository is what LF uses for latest and greatest version. Latest version adds gpg checking, which is required by some LF projects. Also latest versions now support v2 version of the protocol, which is significantly faster for large repos (GitHub supports that protocol version). V2 protocol becomes default in v2.25. This is not the SHA-256 support yet, which has not been merged yet. | Aloys: also GitHub Actions does a shallow clone by default, which creates warnings in SonarCloud. Have to do a “git fetch”, there’s an option in the GitHub Action to pull full git history (SonarCloud will do a git blame to identify when a new warning is identified). Andrew: a 10 level deep clone seems to mostly satisfy SonarCloud. Not sure if the GitHub Action checkout action lets you specify the depth of a git shallow clone. LF uses 10-25 levels deep for Jenkins workflows. Brian: yes, you can specify depth of clone at checkout time. | . | Much cleaner way to release GitHub images, when you create a GitHub release, a GitHub action pushes the release. So more traceable way to go from a Docker back to the build process. So every merge to master no longer triggers a full release. | Added a tool to create a release (80 Docker images) | Discussion for OCIO / OIIO and circular dependency between the test / utility programs (discussion started by a PR). Will create separate ocio-tools and oiio-tools packages to break the cycle. | Larry: historical fluke, have been talking about solving the problem for a long time. Aloys: important to solve for CI of both projects. Would like to support full OIIO that supports OCIO. Also downstream for OSL. Work has started on this. | Larry: sequence should be: build OCIO library only, build full OIIO complete, then complete OCIO | Larry: not the last time we will run into such circular dependencies | Michael: not a huge deal to not build the OCIO apps. Aloys: but mostly important for downstream projects. | Larry: OCIO tools that depend on OIIO are either demos or very specific tools of interest mostly to color scientists. Michael: current ACES config uses some of those tools, but also mainly used by color scientists.. | VFXPlatform 2021 . | Newer compiler testing (GCC 9, Clang 10) | . | . | . Project Specific Goals / Problems . | USD-WG goal (Daniel) . | “Cross-platform build recipes / CI for USD” | Tests, GPU | . | Artifact storage (OpenCue, Brian) . | S3 bucket, currently in use for OpenVDB | Brian: run test on commits to master, create docker images, tarballs. When you cut a release, point to a specific commit, and pull all the artefacts from that build. This was easy to do in Azure Actions, no way to do that on GitHub Actions. Seem to be getting somewhat close using hacky GitHub Actions REST API, but seems unsatisfying, and would be cleaner to push artifacts to our own storage. Happy to use our own S3 bucket? | Andrew: current S3 bucket is set as a “release artifacts” bucket, specific policies about mixing artifact types between policies. So could allocate a separate S3 bucket, or reach out to JFrog for a free Artifactory Cloud set up for ASWF. Supports everything that Nexus did, at the time Nexus was set up, Artifactory Cloud did not exist. | Brian: not sure would classify these artifacts as “development” artifacts, they just don’t have a GitHub Release associated with them. | Andrew: on merge of code, produce artifacts that get stored in a “snapshot repository” (in a Maven / Java environment). Then a staging repo for release candidate, then a release repository for the official releases (3 phase strategy). | Brian: as long as it’s not too repository could be OK, but also very easy to just use a S3 bucket. Andrew: would require having versions on artifacts so you can retrieve them back. Io.aswf.project.artifact-version for example. Could use git sha-1 as the tag / version. In Java / Maven can use snapshots, and resolve latest version of snapshot (otherwise use “coordinates” to refer to specific versions). | Andrew: turnaround to deploy Artifactory Cloud is around 2 weeks, a new S3 bucket would be around 1 week. We would set a timeout policy on the S3 bucket, recommend 30 day for development artifacts. Brian: not producing artifacts from PRs, only commits to master. | Andrew: LF releng already supports Artifactory Cloud for a couple of projects. JF: also supports other repo formats (Conda / Conan). Also both S3 and Artifactory could be both useful. Andrew: there is cost to JFrog for standing up an Artifactory Cloud, so we don’t want to request it unless we will use it. S3 usage would be Pay As You Go. Stick to a S3 dev bucket for now. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | OpenCue Incubation Review (Brian) . | Much development work last year . | Windows Support, Python 3 . | CI system merged into ASWF infrastructure, soon to be GitHub Actions . | Small work: bug fixes, stability fixes, successful effort, closed 193 GitHub Issues, a lot of this work related to getting OpenCue ready for Open Source . | Good growth in engagement in all channels . | Stats from GitHub, users lists: 499 GitHub stars, 148 members on user list, around 100 people on developer list . | Contributions to CI eg Docker Images . | 50% Java / 50% Python . | Multi-component enduser app, including GUI . | Helps to push ASWF in different directions than other projects (typically C++ based) . | Goals for next year: . | ASWF Graduation: would like to get guidance from TAC on priority of CII badge completion / graduation instead of feature work . | Cloud compatibility (GSoC) . | Users/Permissions system . | Packaging and distribution . | . | Graduation progress: . | 5 committers from 4 different companies . | 25 contributors . | 83% complete CII badge . | Prioritized feature work and test coverage . | Static analysis still to be done . | Other checklist items complete . | . | Joshua: did you run into any issues transitioning from your own GitHub organization to ASWF org? Brian: went pretty smoothly, had to figure out CLA system, it’s been stable over last few months. The project was fairly new to GitHub in the first place, so no deep legacy of existing integrations with original organization. Joshua: some projects had “gaps” with key contributors no longer covered by CLA? Brian: yes, some contributors had to fill out new CLA again. | Daniel: can you identify any of the bigger challenges / stumbling blocks that could be improved for other projects? Brian: technical aspects went pretty well, did have to spend time to set up CI system, project with template project really helped and will help in the future. Biggest obstacles are non technical: integrating new contributors, growing the community. | Brian: there is overlap between bug fixing and CII badge, but competition for resources with important features like Windows and Python 3. Lots of work to deal with all static analysis reports, many false positives that take a lot of time to deal with. Some issues are simple and could be “good first issues”, some issues about database interaction are subtle and need deeper knowledge. | Daniel: what are the crucial areas where the projects could use greater support from ASWF or the community? Brian: some technical areas are missing coverage due to original authors not being around anymore. For instance some deeper database expertise could be useful. But overall growing community / engagement / non-technical issues are probably more important. Have been tracking GitHub and email, but hard to identify exactly what is the user base. It would help to have hard data on engagement to report back to corporate sponsors. | Vote on OpenCue status. Daniel: move to vote to extend incubation phase for 6 months. Seconded by Kimball. 6 months would be to consider moving from Incubation to Adopted status, give them more time to get ready for graduation. Michael Min: would community engagement also be a factor in further review in 6 months? Daniel: same criteria would be considered in 6 months. Brian: intent is to move for graduation before 6 months. | All ayes, no oppose or abstain, motion passes, 6 month extension to Incubation status for OpenCue. | . | Open Source Day, SIGGRAPH (Emily) . | Discussion on TAC mailing list. | What to do about Open Source Day vs DigiPro . | Most projects are still interested to have a 1hr BoF . | Do we keep it the same week as DigiPro or move it? Are people blocking out their day for DigiPro? Will people be taking a whole day? . | Kimball: more concerned about timezone . | Emily: trying to figure better support for timezones: pre-record sessions + live Q&amp;A for instance. | Kimball: BoF discussions are usually the best part, but of course no perfect solution . | Emily: as per Larry said, at lot of discussions already happening via TSC, mailing lists, Slack. | Kimball: at OpenEXR BoF last year, we had a number of attendees who are not involved in traditional channels, but someone who has a free hour at SIGGRAPH would just drop by. | Larry: argument for still having the BoFs while we have a conference. If someone won’t join a video TSC meeting, will they join a video BoF? . | Daniel: our TSC meetings assume a lot of context, a BoF targets a larger audience. | Wave: lots of coworkers are interested in specific projects, value is the snapshot of the current state of the project, what they want to share, and what is their roadmap. Can point coworkers to specific events. A BoF can be a good “summing up point” where the video can be valid for a few months afterwards. Project contributors can make themselves available via Slack. | Larry: forcing ourselves to do BoFs in a concentrated time may be bad for attendees? Emily: Open Source Days provide a good opportunity to present the progress of the foundation and all our projects, important to show progress from all projects. | Wave: agree with Larry to avoid DigiPro. People at work have little control over their schedule unless they are travelling, and no one is travelling right now. | Wave: a lot of people will be watching on one screen, while working on another screen (example of WWDC). | Emily: could move to the week after DigiPro (SIGGRAPH “on demand content” week). Larry / Daniel: that does seem like a good option. | Emily: planning to use Zoom webinars, presenters will be able to see attendees, but attendees won’t be able to see each other unless they are using chat. We can potentially do it in the Zoom meeting format (potential security issues). There are other platforms as well, but Zoom is well understood. | There will be a separate Slack channel. | Michael Min: helps to have a dedicated moderator, is that possible with Zoom? . | Emily: Real Time Conference is using Zoom webinars, and designate someone to be moderator. | Emily: look to doing a full day the week before SIGGRAPH, 1 hr BoF sessions. | . | ASWF Fund and Grants . | Remote review tool? . | Daniel: revisit presentation from David Morin . | DIscussion has gone quiet on TAC, anything in the TSCs? . | John: the Governing Board had a strong desire to see if there are ways to use some of the funding available in the ASWF to see if there are opportunities to accelerate not only project development, but also help with D&amp;I. The Governing Board sees a huge need for improving D&amp;I in the industry, lead to WG which has made a lot of progress. But also is there an avenue to help the existing projects, or projects outside the foundation looking to move in. LF has seen projects use a grant structure to do very targeted development, or targeted services such as documentation or infrastructure. Also a path for a mentorship route. The TSCs / TSC chairs often think about “how do we get the next group of people to join / contribute” (example of Larry leading the GSoC initiative). | Rachel: from D&amp;I WG, sent out survey and got really good responses, going over results and will have next meeting soon. Being able to set up some sort of mentorship program, with an eye towards contributing to existing ASWF projects. A lot of work remains to be done. | John: a lot of concepts around net new projects that could be started within ASWF. Until now the ASWF has been bringing in existing projects and helping with sustainability. But now we should be looking at gaps in the open source offerings. Conversations around asset management, and specifically around gathering and distributing assets that can be used for testing. This is tricky due to copyright issues. | Michael Min: there is some ambiguity as to how funds are allocated, and how do engineers from contributing companies are used. How would these funds / grants be used? What does it mean to get a “grant” if you are already staff at a contributing company? . | Daniel: it is up to TAC and Governing Board to define what is appropriate. LF has offered the Community Bridge framework as a model of how to do this. A transparent mechanism, can look at how other open source projects / foundations have used their funds. | Kimball: as an individual corporate, cannot match what GSoC can do, but as a group we could make a difference . | Larry: we could afford the funds that GSoC spends on our 3 students ($6K per student). We could definitely do something similar, with an eye towards D&amp;I for instance. | Kimball: could use this to bootstrap new projects / communities, and reach out to film schools for instance. Larry: could be more targeted effort. | Wave: we talked about assets / test footage, could offer a grant to a film school to generate material, go shoot some footage, generate some models… . | Daniel: will create Action Item for TSC leads and WGs to come up with proposals for the next TAC meeting. If we wanted to look at a remote review tool as a specific project, what would we do to move ahead with something like that. | John: WG structure is probably the most practical structure available for this, might be quickest way forward. Some foundations have concept of a “Lab” or “Sandbox” which could be parallels, but these could be the result of a WG. An incubation project may not need funding to succeed, it may be overkill, whereas a more mature, graduated project may be able to make use of a specific grant to address a specific need. | . | Technical Project updates . | Working Groups . | CI . | Formalize WG status Draft charter README.md . | #wg-ci Slack channel is now open . | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Python 3 . | USD . | Cory: short meeting last wednesday, picked up a few Action Items from previous meetings.

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Conference updates . | Emily: 19-20 August for Open Source Days . | All projects have option of 25min or 55min session, most are going with 55min . | Start at 9AM PDT, will determine how late in the day we will go based on number of projects. | Will ask projects for preferences of time slot to accommodate other timezones, to avoid repeat / recorded sessions as much as possible . | Working on speaker limit on Zoom webinars (originally limit of 3) . | Requested that each project try to be as diverse as possible in their speakers, even if it means inviting someone from outside TSC to present an update . | Website will be up this week, banner ad in SIGGRAPH mailing . | Commitments from ACES, VFX Reference Platform, Rez is a maybe, chasing down MaterialX, USD a maybe, MeshRoom/AliceVision. Alembic? . | Daniel: usually BOFs have physical attendance, you need conference registration of some sort to have access. But what if open source projects are trying to engage people with as few restrictions as possible. Some projects maybe want to have BOFs with SIGGRAPH rather than Open Source days. | SIGGRAPH requires $200 registration fee to be able to attend BOFs in their scope. | ASWF Open Source Days will be free event. | Want to cater also to brand new attendees without background in our projects. | Daniel: (some of) our WGs may want to do a BOF as well, use this an opportunity to welcome new contributors, lay out roadmap, identify opportunities for contribution / areas of need. | Emily: these could be shorter 25min session, could bundle USD WG with a potential USD BOF . | Emily: had discussions with outreach committee about swag: perhaps we could offer opportunity to donate to nonprofit instead. How can we better line up with our D&amp;I mission / effort? Or we could have a swag store tha benefits D&amp;I initiatives. Want to minimize shipping costs. | . | Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) - John . | Number of projects have been using LF shortform CLA with success . | Some newer projects from Disney entities have had questions from Disney legal around some of the terms of these agreements, brought about meeting of legal committee a couple of months ago. | General consensus: need to get as consistent a CLA template as possible, and because Apache CLA more widely used in the industry than LF Short Form CLA, we should converge on Apache CLA. Heard back from Disney legal that this is OK with them, should help with OpenShadingLanguage and OpenTimelineIO to migrate to ASWF repo. | How does this impact things going forward? How should projects think about this? . | Projects are not required to use the CLA contribution framework. Projects don’t need to change their charter. Process of charging the charter is entirely project dependent. TSCs for new projects should decide how they want to proceed, LF (Steve Winslow) is happy to assist and answer questions, work with legal teams to answer questions. | Existing projects do not have to make any changes, no need to change existing CLA process. Would recommend to TSC chairs that if there have been community concerns because of CLA terms, should have discussion in the community to consider the Apache CLA. But that’s not a requirement. | Larry: can a project have more than one CLA to select from? John: that’s typically not a good idea. But projects that came into the ASWF with an existing CLA and picked a different one going forward, no need for older contributors to go back and resign a new CLA. | Larry: for projects that haven’t established CLA, is the Apache CLA “officially” what we should go forward with? John: should be able to go now (standard Apache CLA). Larry: the Apache CLA mentions the Apache license, but some of our projects don’t use the Apache license. Would be great to have a “blessed” version. John: there should be a complete disconnect vs the Apache CCLA / ICLA, and the desire of the legal committee is to use these CLAs in original form. | Daniel: let’s submit PRs to the tac and aswf-sample-project repos. John: legal committee is not there to mandate anything to the TAC but to make recommendations. Daniel: worth having a discussion at TAC level to gauge appetite for changing CLA of existing projects, or just going forward with new ones. | Nick: does this mean that Disney employees are unblocked to contribute to ASWF projects? John: Disney to provide guidance, providing an Apache CCLA. | Joshua: we can use the template project to test the end-to-end process, instead of doing this on a “live” project. There may be unknown blockers until we’ve actually done it. John: would need to work with Steve (LF legal) to figure out how that would be done. | John: try to get all major contributing organizations to sign the CCLA before transitioning a project. But there is overhead to adding CCLA to a project. | Kimball: would it not be possible to do an umbrella CCLA for every ASWF project? John: some issues with projects under different licenses, don’t know if moving to the Apache CCLA resolves that issue or not. But every project wold need to align to the same CCLA, could be a sticking point. But worth discussing. Kimball: would also help people to contribute to any ASWF projects without having to consult with corporate legal team. John: desire from everyone is to make it as simple as possible. | Michael: not opposed to switching CLAs, but currently too busy to do right now. Larry: would be a switch back to CLA that OCIO had before joining ASWF. | Daniel: are there techniques to help with transition? John: “cold turkey” is the best approach once a project has decided to switch. Can have a grace period around cutover to help. Having 2 CLAs active at same time is usually a problematic practice. | OpenCue has Apache CLA, OpenVDB, OpenColorIO, OpenEXR have LF shortform, OpenTimelineIO and OpenShadingLanguage are stuck in “CLA purgatory” but now have a way forward. | Daniel: next step to reach out to project TSCs, would be preferable to try to move every project to a compatible (Apache) CLA. | . | Working Groups . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Rachel: since last TAC meeting, sent out survey to WG member, gathered useful info, will meet every 4 weeks, will use Google Drive, gathered thoughts and opinions on what goals will be. | Drafted goals document: . | Encourage high school and college students to contribute to M&amp;E-related open source projects (external facing goals) . | Ensure that ASWF has diverse leadership across foundation and projects . | Better education internally at companies . | . | Discussed initiatives under each of these 3 goals. | First step is to put together D&amp;I blog posts for ASWF web site, can be done quickly! . | Emily: updates to web site with links to project, pulled some intro courses from LF web site . | Rachel: should be ready to officially submit WG charter to TAC very soon . | Emily: need to figure out best communication channels with each project . | Meetings are second wednesday of each month. Sub initiatives can have meetings on off weeks. | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: working on deliverables document . | Progress a bit slow, found that groups that are turning up aren’t very far (if at all) into Python 3 transition, so more looking for guidance than offer guidance . | Autodesk representative at last meeting which was good, having issues getting representation from vendors. | Daniel / Emily will help reach out to vendors . | Daniel: do we have representation from ASWF projects? We haven’t done a checkin across the projects. | Ashley: hasn’t really been discussed as a topic. So far no one has pointed to an ASWF project as a Python 3 blocker . | Stable cadence: every two weeks, alternating between earlier and later in the day Vancouver time to accommodate timezones . | . | USD . | Some practical issues with Wiki contributions that need to be worked out | . | CI . | For projects interested in porting to Apple Silicon, contact drwave@apple.com if you want remote access to the Apple Developer Transition Kit at MacStadium. | Larry: any updates on GitHub Actions supporting Apple Silicon for CI builds? Wave: someone from Apple will be at next CI meeting and should be able to answer that. Shouldn’t be a problem. | Porting projects to Apple Silicon should make them able to run on iOS / iPadOS . | Andrew / Michael: initial GPU build of OCIO on AWS CodeBuilder fired off, initially failed but should be working soon. Remaining issues with not being able to have access to secrets to build from PRs. | Michael: won’t necessary be able to run test suite on PRs before merge. Andrew: would need a development branch where you accept PRs to run testing, then merge from dev branch to main branch. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | Larry / Kris: excited about the CLA blocker being resolved . | OCIO / Michael: issues with first time contributors not reading contribution documentation first, looking to install some pre-PR hooks to help with that . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 29 July 2020 | . | .

(Daniel) . | Is this needed given our regular cadence meeting? | Expose our work to a larger audience, opportunity to draw in other contributors | Would make sense to align one of our regular meetings with this program | Formalize the work we’ve done and what we want to do as a few slides | Daniel will talk to Emily to find a slot in the program | . | GPU Resources . | OCIO request for AWS setup JIRA ticket (Andy) | Michael: stalled at the moment, challenge is that we can spin up the build on AWS CodeBuild, no way to investigate the logs, challenge of not having access to the AWS. | Andrew: just got the logs, dumped to a S3 bucket. One line Javascript error, looks like a string formatting issue. Will need to run another build to get more complete logs (as they will now be stored in a S3 bucket). The S3 bucket will be public, will be a generic ASWF public bucket for artifacts. (originally request for OpenCue artifacts). | Andrew: OpenCue was asking for a location to store artifacts, credentials will be stored as organization-wide secrets. Not sufficient for Terraform, also need a DynamoDB database for locking. | Deletion policy is automatic after 1 week, does generate costs against ASWF | Brian: getting credentials will be next step for OpenCue, 1 week retention should be fine. Andrew: if we need longer, that can be done (Jenkins logs are retained for 6 months). Brian: storage mostly required for passing artefacts between GitHub Actions pipelines, so 1 week retention is fine. | Michael: GPU builds actually working now, remaining issues is logs not being pushed back to GitHub Actions. | . | Windows . | Proof of concept of building Windows container with GitHub Actions and WIndows version supported by GHA (JF) | Andrew: have not heard anything about containerized builds on Windows, AWS CodeBuild is currently only option for “elastic” builds. | AWS has released GitHub Action to support CodeBuild which explicitly supports GPU containers on Linux. | JF: we would be happy with non-GPU accelerated Windows containers at this point. | Andrew: GHA are more likely to offer elastic deployment of self hosted builders before they are likely to support build inside Windows containers. | So we should probably try to move ahead with a non-containerized solution such as Vcpkg / Conan / Conda. JF to look at what’s the package manager that would it easier to pull a set of components compatible with the VFX Reference Platform. | Larry: have used vcpkg on Windows, played a little bit with Conan and Conda but not extensively enough to answer the question of “how easy it would be to have a VFX Reference Platform environment”. | JF: vcpkg may be opinionated about preferring “latest version” | Larry: vcpkg is similar to Homebrew on Mac, but lacks a pre-built cached install, has to rebuild everything from scratch, for instance no way to tell it that it doesn’t need to build dependencies in debug mode when doing a release build. ASWF Containers have cut down CI build times tremendously. | . | Mac . | MacStadium / Orka . | Marshall: Docker on Mac runs Linux containers, not macOS containers | macOS virtualization is a full VM | MacStadium Orka is probably the best approach, has good history of hosted macOS | Orka looks like a reasonable approach | Currently using GitHub Actions on macOS runners, but: . | No control on the macOS / Xcode version, was moved forward without much warning, breaking builds | Little option to access multiple versions for a build matrix | We typically have a window of 3 years where commercial DCCs need to support older macOS versions | Are there best practices / guidance as far as managing availability of older versions of macOS / SDK? How about using using a package management system to manage access to dependencies? | Marshall: for the main SDK components that come with the platform, that all comes with the SDK shipped with Xcode. Just announced Xcode 12 which includes the SDKs for iOS 14 / macOS Big Sur, and support to build for Apple Silicon. Guidance is to use the latest version of Xcode and SDK to build software for the latest version of macOS. But can deploy back as far as you want, in Xcode GUI can deploy back to macOS 10.9, “availability annotations” in the SDK to show how far back you want to support. There isn’t a need to build on a 10.9 macOS with a 10.9 SDK to support macOS 10.9. So recommendation is always to build on latest macOS and toolchain, but targeting older platforms if needed. Especially recommending keeping up with major Xcode releases (and in this case support for Apple Silicon). | Daniel: this can give backwards binary compatibility, but doesn’t guarantee that someone on an older platform can build your project if you are targeting the newer toolchain. By comparison on Linux we tend to isolate the environment + toolchain. | Should ASWF projects state that they only support building on latest macOS / Xcode versions? | Michael: had issues on both macOS and Windows when CI builders got upgraded without much warning, which broke the build a couple of times. Christina: had similar macOS issues with OpenEXR. The container approach provides insulation against those types of issues. | Daniel: were the breakages “meaningful”, or small details? Michael: new warnings from new compiler versions could fail builds (we enable warnings as errors). We’re trying to use the images provided by GitHub Actions as much as possible, doing less customization when possible. | Christina: some breakage related to Python versions, and BoostPython looking for specific Python versions. | Daniel: is reliable availability of specific Python version an issue? JF: bundled Python is going away in macOS. Christina: difficult to get CMake to pick up a locally installed Python version. | Michael: there were some missing headers to build Python on macOS, required an optional SDK installer. But OCIO now using bundled Python 3. | Andrew: would CMake run in a virtualenv? How is it finding Python? Aloys: the way Cmake (and Cmake packages) look for Python is messy andhard to control. There is a specific “FindPython” CMake package. Having a consistent way to find Python in ASWF packages would be useful. | Daniel: it was an early goal to have consistent ways to find packages across projects. | Marshall: planning to join CI WG meetings going forward to help. | Larry: it would be great if the GitHub team could be prodded into providing GitHub Actions support for running on Apple Silicon as soon as possible so projects can start supporting the platform. Need more than cross compilation, want to be able to run test suite on actual Apple Silicon machines. | . | . | Apple Silicon / ARM builds . | There may be DTKs available from MacStadium | . | Discussion on Xcode version on VFX Platform mailing list | Big Sur shows up both as 10.16 and 11.0 . | If you are running Big Sur on Apple Silicon DTK it will report as macOS 11 | That’s the long term goal for final release | You can check for an API on 10.16 -&gt; will report 11 APIs | . | . | ASWF-docker updates . | Git v2 . | Everywhere in ASWF containers, no issues reported | . | VFXPlatform 2021 . | Newer compiler testing (GCC 9, Clang 10) | Update to CUDA 11? Not sure if NVIDIA has released base Docker images yet. Will release the 2021 trial images at that point, support for CUDA in gcc 9. | . | OpenEXR performance testing for imath, useful to keep track of timing for performance tests. Can use SonarCloud, but no support for graphing of results over time (on prem version has that support). Andrew: Sonar lost the ability to create custom dashboards in latest release. | Aloys: seems to be difficult to find solid information on the topic of tracking performance testing. Sentry seems to have some support. Do any other LF projects keep track of performance? Andrew: mostly using Sonar, and it doesn’t work anymore. One project is using an ELK stack to stick stats into it. | Daniel: what about the execution environment consistency, no guarantees that the execution environment doesn’t change, can be difficult to ensure reliable results. Aloys: Sonar used to allow annotating results based on hardware changes. Elastic Search / ELK could be a good solution. Is it something that LF releng could provide? Andrew: LF releng hasn’t set up ELK stacks for any projects, but used a vendor, so a passthrough cost. Can investigate what it would look like / cost. JF: what about CDash, does that keep track of performance results? | Waiting for Docker support on Windows / macOS may be too long, what about using Res and S3 bucket? These would require longer lived, fairly large S3 buckets (Clang, Qt, Boost results in large artifacts). | Daniel: approach based on Res would be directly usable in a studio environment. | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Conference update . | Open Source days scheduled almost finalized . | Reaching out to speakers with logistics . | Will be using Zoom, can have more than 3 presenters per project . | Still need length of session for CI working group, who will talk. Daniel: how long are other sessions? Emily: 25 or 55 minutes, D&amp;I will be 55 minutes since includes a panel, other groups are 25 or 55. Daniel: will depend on how deep into the details we want to go, but 25 minutes is likely sufficient. Emily: Python3 group doesn’t have enough content, but could include an update in the CI session? For SIGGRAPH, submitting a ASWF overview, and a BoF as a “whirlwind tour” of ASWF project, 10 minute update from each project. | Also does USD working group want to present, reached out to Cory . | Can make many different presenters, so easier to include as presenter people who are likely to answer questions during Q&amp;A session, easier to do up front rather than switch from attendee to presenter during Q&amp;A. | Linux Foundation events team and Emily / John will be on during sessions to help. Each Zoom session will have its own link but same password. | Open Source Days registration site is up . | Registration will be required, email will go out with a password a day or two before the event. | Graphics will be provided so anyone else wants to “advertize” the event . | . | Working Groups . | CI . | Daniel: focussing on marching forward with GPU / CI setup using AWS CodeBuilder, moving along, Michael Dolan can update. | Also started to go deeper into Mac platform support, Wave put us in touch with Marshall Elfstrand from Apple Developer Relations team who will contribute going forward. | Doug Walker: progress on GPU CI is going forward. Andy: logs are now working, being forwarded from AWS CodeBuilder back to GHA. Still getting a failure saying there’s no “head attached” to the builder. Looks like the correct NVIDIA drivers may not be installed? https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/projects/IT/queues/custom/18/IT-19573 Sean Looper can help find the right person at AWS if we need help. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: update is short. Met with ASWF Board to present an update, slides + survey that happened a month or so ago, and first draft of goals and deliverables. Next meeting planned for Open Source Days, second draft of charter for the group. | Emily: will have a session at Open Source Days, and other events planned as well. | Brief showing of the slides . | Survey Results: many respondents from several studios (30 responses). | Asking about familiarity with open source, what age group / experience level should be targeted (college &amp; university age was majority response) . | Asking about what programs would have most impact: mentorships and partnerships with other organizations . | Draft goals: encourage high school and college students to pursue career in or participate in open source projects, ensure ASWF has diverse leadership and membership, provide guidance and resource to ASWF members . | Student education is an external goal: develop a mentorship program . | Diversity in ASWF: work with TAC and Board to establish internal D&amp;I goals, work with ASWF projects to in place a D&amp;I ambassador to ensure projects are inviting to newcomers of all backgrounds . | Guidance to member: blog posts on D&amp;I for members, gather D&amp;I resources for members . | Poll: looking for ideas on how to target universities . | Poll: looking for ideas on partner organizations . | Would like to develop a model for these programs that could be repeatable across other universities and organizations . | Should also target universities / organizations with which we have established, personal relationships . | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: good meeting this week. How to get people more motivated about the transition. The need to transition to Python 3 is often seen as a chore, so coming up with a list of pros and cons to help convince studios that it is a good idea. | Will start thinking about how the VFX industry will connect more with the Python community. We have custom solutions which may be better served by general purpose solutions from the greater community. Daniel: packaging and distribution approaches, or anything else? Ashley: best practices, using PyLint, Black for formatting. Got in contact with The Foundry, may get some representation from them, and hoping to get someone from SideFX. Martin from Autodesk has been attending, which has been very helpful. | . | USD . | The is now a Wiki on Confluence, richer experience and easier to make contribution. https://wiki.aswf.io/display/WGUSD/USD+Working+Group . | Working Group meeting mostly covered the Wiki, some issues with ID management. Meeting notes are going to the Wiki, they aren’t in the repo. | Daniel: Cory and others have done a good job of scoping out the broad structure and the kind of information to be captured. Setting up goals and non goals has been a good mechanism. | No answer right now about USD WG and Open Source days. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | Website and documentation updates is a common topic across projects . | Doug: OpenColorIO is busy on revamping the website and documentation as approaching SIGGRAPH.This SIGGRAPH is “feature complete” milestone for V2, preparing DigiPro presentation on August 12th. Overhaul documentation system, new logo, lots in progress. | Cary: OpenEXR making progress on web site. Asked whether best to keep project source in main repo or separate repo. Ended up preferring a separate repo to hide the chatter from the website update. Also get the whole website source when you clone the repo if only a single repo. Will lift content from existing site into new site, should be online soon. Sarah Martin at ILM has been helping, taking the documentation that was written in OpenOffice years ago and available in PDF format, and converting it to an online format, which should make it easier to access. Target is Open Source Days. Also have a new logo. New Logo . | Cary: new repo with separate imath seems to be working. Building OpenEXR against the new library is forcing a large reorganization / modernization. Retiring the “ILM” name from the library, will be called “openexr” rather than “ilmimf”. Long overdue cleaning up of the code structure. Now working on CMake / CI infrastructure to build and deal with the new dependency on the iMath repo. | Larry: some of the modernization is also in progress such as putting const_expr in the right places. | Cary: compatibility with the CUDA “half” type is also done. | John: LF has an internal team that can help with logo redesigns. OpenEXR did 3 iterations with LF graphic designers. | John: a number of the project TSCs have discussed a shift over to the Apache CLA, a plurality of these projects are looking to make the shift in the short or mid term. Still owe the exact wording of what will come in the EasyCLA system, waiting for this for OpenTimelineIO and OpenShadingLanguage, which will help to make over the graduation hump. | John: will submit a PR against the tac repo to update the sample CLAs (currently LF short form). JF will submit an issue against the repo. | Chris: OSL just waiting for final copy of CLA, hopefully can be fast tracked through legal and move forward. Last thing OSL is waiting for. | USD working group: JT has been working on Jupyter workbooks, will add intro and advanced documents, could be moved to a Wiki or repo. Could be leveraged across all ASWF projects. Daniel: moving towards a modern style of documentation, “learning as you are doing”. JT: Jupyter notebooks allow running code, interspaced with text documentation. Netflix did a good blog post on how they are using it. | Eric: TAC meeting in 2 weeks is coincident with ASWF talk at Digipro, would it be possible to move the. Daniel: waiting for Open Source Days schedule as well, which may require moving some WG meeting dates. Daniel: we can move TAC meeting, easiest way to go. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 12 August 2020 | . | . ",

    "content": ". | CLA Followup (John) . | PR for guidance: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/pull/186 . | Follow up from last meeting, guidance and links to specific CCLA and ICLA that we are attempting to move our projects to, and recommend for new projects . | Lots of good discussion on that PR. Are we ready to go? . | John: looks like we’ve addressed all the pieces of feedback so far, so doesn’t seem like there are any blockers? But don’t want to assume from other TAC members. Had Steve Winslow from LF, he added a few comments. We are trying to be careful how we advertise this, “ASWF 2020 CLA” since there are a few accommodations on top of the Apache CLA, so we use a different naming. But when talking to internal counsel for sign off, can make it clear that it is a derivative of the Apache ICLA/CCLA. | Daniel: looks like we should go ahead and merge, further PR should be directed to the PR thread. | . | Conference Updates (Emily) . | Good to pre-designate people who will like to answer questions to make it faster to switch on video . | 200 registrations so far . | All sessions will be recorded, uploaded to YouTube a week later . | Brian: for Q&amp;A, will chat happen within the Zoom webinar tool for chat? Emily: someone will be designated to deal with questions, we can point people to project Slack channels, for some of the sessions that don’t have one, we can ask channels to the ASWF Slack. At conclusion at each project session, we should redirect people to Slack, it won’t be possible to continue Q&amp;A after the end of the session. | Sean McDuffee: talk has multiple speakers at different locations, is that OK? Emily: yes, that’s not a problem as long as everyone is designated as a speaker. Also probably have one person to have a single slide deck rather than having different presenters sharing their own section of a deck. | Daniel: using Keynote with Zoom screen sharing can be tricky. Pre-baked PDF can help to reduce points of failure. | Cary: can we do a dry run before the day? OpenEXR will have several speakers. Emily: can set up a dummy Zoom session. Sean McDuffee: would be great for us as well. Brian: same for OpenCue. JT: usually referred to as a “tech rehearsal”. | SIGGRAPH: will be doing a Foundation Update on Monday August 24th, plus whirlwind project updates, for people who can make SIGGRAPH but not Open Source Days. | SIGGRAPH BoF participation: costs and barriers to entry (Michael). Need “Enhanced” registration level for BoF access. Would it make sense to sponsor access for some of the important initiatives we want to present? Emily: it is SIGGRAPH’s BoF policy, shows that it’s important to have our own events. But ASWF may be able to cover costs for ASWF presenters at SIGGRAPH costs. No details have been shared so far, what platform will be used, or if recordings of BoFs will be available. | Emily: most of the content will be a repeat of that’s presented at Open Source Days, which will be openly available. Want to figure out updates from groups that aren’t doing separate updates during Open Source Days. | Conference app and privacy (Whova - JF). On Zoom, moderators can decide how much data to be shared. | Daniel: a number of attendees are busy with Digipro, unfortunately it wasn’t possible to reschedule TAC meeting. | . | Git branch names (Kimball) . | TAC list thread . | Kimball: OpenEXR looking at renaming branches to work towards D&amp;I goals, and have a large merge ahead so good time. | USD has renamed its primary branch “dev” where they accept PRs. | We should try to agree to do the same thing on all repos, it’s not a hard requirement but would be helpful to be consistent. Should we use “dev” like USD? Does the D&amp;I committee have any feedback on this? . | Brian: what about “main” which seems to be prevalent (GitHub recommends that). Kimball: not thrilled with “main”. Andrew: GitHub went with “main” since it’s generic, doesn’t make a statement as to policy, so they just went with “main”. Daniel: doesn’t tie in with any of standard git branch naming schemes. | Cary: confusion of looking at online documentation &amp; examples, makes sense to stick with as straightforward a config as possible? . | Daniel: good time to draw feedback from projects. Kimball: don’t necessarily feel strongly about it, but a good moment in time to make this change for OpenEXR. Don’t have a strong opinion as to “main” vs “dev”. Nick Porcino had voiced objection about “dev” vs “release”. Unclear as to why USD went with “dev”. “Dev” doesn’t make sense for EXR images repo. Chris Kulla: OSL had been leaning towards “dev/release”, “main” is too vague? Andrew: might push towards “dev” / “release”, if the default branch you get when you clone a repo is “dev”, it tells you something about where to submit PRs. Cary: OpenEXR Images repo could have a different structure. JF: projects are supposed to have a stated branching strategy document. Chris: what do you get by default, the “dev” or the “release”: GitHub lets you configure what is the default branch when you clone a repo. Kimball: the UI also reflects that, where your PRs go by default. Can encourage “dev” as the default destination for PRs. | Daniel: should we use our template project to have a proposal as to our recommended GitHub / git setup? Capture essence of this discussion. To be discussed as a PR on the Sample Project. Could add a poll to decide between alternatives, looks like there’s some weight behind “dev / release”. | . | OpenTimelineIO incubation review process (Josh, John) . | Pushed to next TAC meeting due to availability . | Will try to do presentation and vote during the same meeting . | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenVDB (Ken) . | NanoVDB . | Sub project in the main OpenVDB project, being worked at NVIDIA . | TSC voted to adopt project into OpenVDB last week . | Ken not available this week, anyone else have info . | JT: from attending TSC meeting, looks like an important project, looking to work on a release of information for Open Source Days, perhaps have been talking to Emily? It looks like a really important project for OpenVDB users. | Emily: have been in touch with OpenVDB, working on a press release, some questions as to whether it gets its own repo or not. | JT: decided on repo structure at yesterday’s TSC meeting. Also releasing version 7.1. | NanoVDB is a similar implementation of OpenVDB but targeting mobile applications, so subset of functionality, no external dependencies. Also uses the GPU. | Daniel: there will be technical interest within the TAC, as well as how does this get organized without ASWF organization, hopefully in time for events next week. | . | OpenEXR (Kimball, Cary) . | Cary: preparing for the Open Source Day next week, and companion initial release of OpenEXR 3.0. Things may be proceeding a bit more slowly than expected, may not have an actual release in time for the presentation. | Nearing end of Owen Thomson internship, he’s interested to keep working for the project (also he’s looking for a full time position if anyone is interested). | Kimball: rewritten the core of EXR, around 8x faster to open a header, will present at the Open Source Days. | Daniel: topics on migration and dependencies of VFX Platform 2021 which already specifies OpenEXR v3. How can we ease the transition. | Kimball: there will be additional APIs for thread safety, but existing API should still work as is, some C++11 related cleanups, but leaving typedefs in there, some headers may have deprecation warnings but will still be present. | . | OSL (Chris) . | PR posted by Larry for the new official CLAs . | Will take a vote on the next meeting (after SIGGRAPH) . | “In the home stretch” . | . | . | Working Groups . | CI (Daniel) . | No CI meeting since last TAC meeting . | Some activity with OCIO and GPU CI . | Andy: builds are trying to happen but having issues accessing the GPUs for OpenGL, in touch with AWS to try to resolve issue . | Provided a S3 bucket for OpenCue to pass artifacts between passes if needed . | 14 day retention policy, can be used for other projects who might need this as well . | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion (Carol, Rachel, Emily) . | Submitting charter this week . | Meeting earlier this week, looking for volunteers to lead various initiatives, university partnerships and outreach, join calls, mentorships . | Not a ton to update, should have more activity after SIGGRAPH . | . | Python 3 (Ashley) . | Meeting earlier this week, anyone can give update? Will check in on the notes. | . | USD (Cory) . | Meeting this week. Continuing to flesh out Wiki, “State of USD-Interest” newsletter for August. Looking to update the landing page of the Wiki to give more guidance to anyone who lands there. Will announce Wiki more widely on usd-interest . | Doc and tutorials on USD web site a gentler introduction . | Aloys has working USD inside a Jupyter notebook . | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | 26 August 2020 | . | .

    "content": ". | Welcome new voting member: Laurent Ruel, Unity Technologies . | Laurent currently on leave, so will be introduced at next meeting. | . | OpenSourceDays, SIGGRAPH updates (Emily) . | 700 registrants, 495 unique attendees over the course of 2 days . | Unique attendee counts per session is available . | 75% of registrants had never attended ASWF events . | Majority were engineers working in VFX / animation . | Majority had 10+ years experience . | OpenEXR / OpenVDB / OpenColorIO were projects with majority of attendee experience . | All videos are on YouTube . | OTIO had to reschedule, will be in the next week or 2. No need for new registration. | SIGGRAPH: both bofs both had over 300 attendees, . | OpenSource Days ahead of SIGGRAPH? We might want to do it after SIGGRAPH to use SIGGRAPH to bring people to OpenSource Days . | A lot of educators and students participating SIGGRAPH events, and had people from education reach out (University of Florida Open Source Club) . | Good leads for mentorship programs, identify where we would have needs . | Put together intro slide deck in D&amp;I group to reach out to schools . | Feel free to share feedback on Open Source Days with Emily . | Larry: agreed with having general sessions at SIGGRAPH first, has been a busy last few weeks for everyone, maybe we could change having exactly the same meeting at SIGGRAPH and OSD to avoid confusion. | Cary: would have wished for more discussion / questions, missing the sense of “everyone in the room”. Curious how the other sessions went? Did other sessions seem quiet? . | Emily: across the board the chats / Q&amp;As were fairly quiet, even at SIGGRAPH BoF it was fairly quiet. May want to “seed the chat”, also Zoom Webinar vs Zoom Meeting format, ASWF used Zoom Webinar, SIGGRAPH had Zoom Meeting which required more moderation. General BoF opened the Zoom meeting early and had informal chat between attendees before the meeting. Also D&amp;I panel had more interactivity due to less structured nature of the event. | Some of the attendees we had were very new, perhaps we should have a separate “state of the union” meeting for projects once or twice a year? So we could plan individual events, with more engagement of the community. Not so difficult to set up, Emily can help coordinate. | Daniel: everyone realized that Slack is a good way to pick up these conversations, in some cases there was good flow from sessions into Slack channels. Would be a good idea to welcome new attendees in Slack channels. | Larry: all of the Slack channels picked up new members after the meetings, also a thread about Slack archiving / limited retention of Slack free. | Emily: 80 new members, more than half of all messages are direct messages. Not a lot of technical discussions on the mailing lists, immediacy of Slack helps. | . | Governing Board updates (David) . | David summarized Open Source Days for governing board . | Taking some of the ideas and requests for project activity, and how do we take those beyond “that’s a good idea”? . | Working group for Collaborative Remote Review? (extension of “Media Player”) . | Datasets for testing and/or machine learning . | . | . | Vote: OpenTimelineIO Incubation review . | Deferred to next meeting | . | Vote: Diversity &amp; Inclusion WG endorsement . | Charter README.md . | Rose: Charter similar to what was presented in previous meetings, targeting high school and college age students. Internal goals: leadership and projects, how to improve diversity. Third goal: how to help member companies and individuals get education around D&amp;I and how to make things more inviting. | Carol: split into goals and deliverables, came up with some deliverables: . | Mentorships and partnerships with schools and universities . | Set D&amp;I goals internally at AWSF . | D&amp;I ambassador per project to take part in D&amp;I activities . | Blog and landing page for D&amp;I WG . | First 1-2 years as schedule / target . | . | Daniel: D&amp;I WG has a long term schedule . | Daniel moves motion to endorse adoption of WG charter . | All Ayes, no abstains or nays, unanimous endorsement | . | Rachel: successful presentations at OSD and SIGGRAPH, received a lot of emails, especially from educators interested in combining forces. Also interest from SIGGRAPH itself which has its own D&amp;I initiatives. In the process of going through and responding to emails, looking at potential partnerships. Emily looking at the LF mentorship platform, Community Bridge. Emily: now is a good time to capitalize on recent interest. | John: a lot of this is driven by interest generated at OSD, also have universities looking at associate membership. Some overlap with Larry’s work on GSoC, CommunityBridge is used by many LF projects, but also use GSoC. We should set up a meeting to help identify leaders to drive the membership program, can reuse experience with other LF projects. Can send Doodle poll to figure out best time for such a discussion. | Carol: would this initiative be run through D&amp;I group, in partnership with all the member projects? John: it’s up to this group / TAC to decide how they want to go about it. Is mentorship mostly focussed around D&amp;I, or broader scope? Has been done both ways across LF projects. Emily: some of this will depend on how many volunteers show interest from projects, and who wants to do the work. Carol: D&amp;I would like to take a leadership role in this, can set up a call with John to figure out how the program runs, and help guide the projects through mentorship. Rachel: no matter how it gets run, there should be a component of the D&amp;I group in it. Even if a mentorship program isn’t solely focussed on D&amp;I, it can still help with D&amp;I objectives as long as those objectives are taken into consideration. | Daniel: timing is excellent since GSoC projects are wrapping up, we’ve learned a lot through those, and have been a test case for a very structured kind of mentorship, all projects have had a very positive experience. We have a lot of momentum going forward. | Brian: OpenCue had great experience with GSoC, would love to be involved with mentorship initiative. | . | Working Group Updates . | CI . | Charter README.md . | Somewhat retroactive but good to codify . | CI WG should get is own repo . | Already has Slack channel, but no separate mailing list . | Daniel moving to endorse, JF seconds. All ayes, no abstains or nays, CI WG charter adopted. | . | Didn’t have meeting last week because of overlap with OSD presentation . | Targeting SIGGRAPH for successful run of GPU build for OCIO: made it just in time . | Michael: got a successful build setup using AWS CodeBuild. Commits to Master Branch will target GPU builds, was a bit tricky to figure out how to run without X server, but recent commits added EGL headless rendering. | Michael: would need to be able to run this in context of PRs, but secrets management is problematic. Andrew: common request, GitHub working on this. | Daniel: to be followed up in CI working group. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Covered above | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: quiet meeting this week due to SIGGRAPH, working on trying to get statements from DCC vendors about Python 3 status. Stuck in feedback loop of vendors not wanting to drop Python 2.7 as long as customers demand it, and studios aren’t going to move to Python 3 as long as Python 2.7 is supported in DCCs. | Daniel: is there anything the TAC or projects can help with this standoff? . | Ashley: SideFX / Foundry / Autodesk are involved, would be useful to have contacts with other vendors to get specific statements from them. | VES Tech Committee informal Python 3 survey . | . | USD . | Cory: Wiki has been announced to usd-interest mailing list . | Will review content added at next meeting . | Interesting discussion on “pseudo standardization” of schemas, initially wasn’t a stated goal of the WG, but there seems to be some desire for this. Asking the USD team what they would like to see the USD WG do in that regard. Make sure that there are no competing standardization efforts. | Looking at some non-VFX interest in USD: civil engineering, VR . | Some discussion on standardization of USD itself, looking at VFX Platform BoF discussion on USD, whether it should be included or not. Having internal discussion about that. | . | . | Follow ups . | Git branch names (Kimball) . | TAC will discuss choice made by OpenEXR and discuss whether that should be recommended for other ASWF projects. | Cary: settled on “dev” and “release”, was supposed to roll out earlier this week but ran into issues. “Release” will be the default branch which people will get when they clone by default, “dev” will be where PRs are merged, previously called “master”. | Andrew: GitHub now allows setting a default name at the organization level, it’s still set to default of “master”, in the future will switch to default of “main” . | David: took a look a discussion between core developers, everyone agreed on “main”, so it is a bit odd to not go with what everyone has agreed to. | Daniel: probably need to be further discussed . | . | Slack archiving (JF) . | Actively harvest useful messages into other locations . | Or pay for full archiving . | Larry: is price per user means any user show has ever posted? . | John: based on active user during period of time, Slack will compute active users within last month (not clear if it’s people posting or just login in). So could have a large increase in your bill if many new users join. | Michael: are there any considerations between LF / ASWF for archival of communications, and SoX-like legal requirements? . | John: outside of more official action by a board, LF doesn’t know that there are requirements to record anything. | Wave: what kind of money are we looking at? Daniel: we should look at usage over last 6 months, and see how much this would cost in a paid model. Of course we wouldn’t want to direct messages. | John: current cost would be $1928 for this month, 426 members. So possibly $30K budget. | Emily: we probably don’t want important conversations to get buried in Slack history anyway. | Larry: Slack is not permanent. John: this is not the first foundation to deal with free vs paid Slack. Cost is always an issue, Slack can be a challenging tool for finding important conversations, the searching tools are not as good as with a mailing list. Slack tends to be good for instant / interactive conversations, otherwise mailing lists or GitHub Issues may be more appropriate. Depends on how projects like to collaborate. | Could look at other alternatives such as Mattermost, but it’s a different tool, with several costs associated with transition. | Andy: LF is currently investigating Matrix as an offer for all projects, including bridging into Slack. JT: these bridges can be quite useful. | . | . | Mentoring (John) . | Technical Project updates . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting . | Sept 9, 2020 | . | . ",

    "content": ". | New member introduction: Laurent Ruel, Unity Technologies . | Welcome! . | Laurent: started in broadcast, worked at TVA Networks in Montreal, production, control systems, on air automation systems, architecture, coding and design. Election and newsroom systems. Started a company in 97 to make a video server / clip / stills store / character generation on a PC using Matrox cards, became part of Kaydara. Worked on Motion Builder, leading engineering / QA / training / support, became part of Alias, then Autodesk. Product Manager on Maya, then cloud backup at Mozy (sp). Then Grass Valley (monitoring &amp; routers) before joining Unity in 2016, responsible for engineering in Verticals Group: architecture, engineering, construction, M&amp;E, manufacturing and retail. | Daniel: have you had any previous engagement with the ASWF projects? Laurent: not so much yet, but working on OTIO integration, USD, OCIO. | . | OpenTimelineIO incubation review: Josh . | Vote: Project status and next review . | Josh: A bit over a year since OTIO was accepted in incubation stage in ASWF. Set some internal goals around community and industry awareness. A number of items on the checklist to graduation have been done. | Healthy number of committers . | Substantial ongoing flow of commits . | Document project owners and committers . | Technical lead representative to TAC . | Initial license scan . | … . | . | Community contributions: . | Netflix &amp; Storm Studios: image sequence . | Autodesk: spatial coordinate systems schema . | Rodeo FX: EDL improvements . | GSoC: Java &amp; C bindings . | Igalia: xges improvements . | Upcoming: . | Blender community (JT Nelson) . | Frame.io . | Ahead.io (Cezanne &amp; shott.io) . | . | Would be good to have more formal channels to engage with companies . | OTIO is very please with working with ASWF . | Outstanding issues: . | Modified Apache 2.0 license . | TSC Charter: blocked on license (informal TSC for now) . | CII best practices badge . | Currently at 61% . | Security expertise &amp; guidance needed: what does security look like in a framework that has Python plugins? . | Hoping to focus on this . | . | . | Still work to be done before graduation stage: would like to remain in incubation stage. | Requesting continued assistance moving forward with licensing issues. | Daniel: great presentation, gives a roadmap for moving forward. Are there particular areas where TAC can help unblock some issues, offer expertise? Josh: hard to put finger on what needs to happen with licensing. There isn’t a lot of urgency getting these issues straightened out within Disney organization. Setting a timeframe could help to provide momentum. John: it’s a decision of the TAC to renew incubation renewal. ASWF / LF has been working with OTIO for a year, licensing issues have been starting to get unblocked, in communication with Disney legal. There is a path forward, but these things can take time. | Josh: what are we trying to “protect against” in the context of security requirements? Daniel: we grappled with those issues with the first set of projects, could be time to revisit. OpenEXR has been the most visible example and gives a good baseline. Some of our other projects have a plugin approach as well (OpenCue). | Josh: OTIO does see the value moving forward, but who gets to judge “how secure are we”? . | Larry: we had this set of discussions with some of the earlier project, a simplified view is that issues related to crypto and login security are typically not relevant to our projects, we don’t have user IDs, logins, PII… So many of these criteria don’t apply to our projects. But because these packages can be embedded into other systems, we don’t want to be the source for security vulnerability. Static Analysis + some Fuzz Testing is sufficient to self certify. Kimball: can also define subsets of the projects that have higher security requirements / a build mode for just the core of the system without the extension mechanism. | Daniel: security reporting and address process needs to be in place. Josh: got a notification that a component of the build system had a vulnerability, and was able to address it. John: there are offerings from LF to help with vulnerability management. | Stephan: like the idea of being able to disable the plugin system, or enable only internal plugins. Would be good to have partnerships with the community to help adopt processes from the other projects. | Josh: as commercial applications start adopting OTIO, expecting more feedback from vendors. | Eric: any guidance on how often fuzzing analysis should be performed? Kimball: OpenEXR already had a fuzz system built into it, but it takes so long that it only gets run once a week, same as static analysis pass. The Google OSS Fuzz service is outside the project’s control. | Daniel: for OpenCue we extended a maximum review period of 6 months since they wanted to move out of incubation. What would OTIO want? . | Josh: 6 months sounds fine, sooner would be better, but that would be a good deadline for now. | Larry: should we think about triaging what the holdouts are, and expect the project to have made substantial project on parts of the process it has active control (CII bad, TSC minus the licensing specifics). Josh: that sounds reasonable. | Larry: present motion to review in 6 months with expectation that parts of the process under control of the project have been addressed. Second from Kimball. | All ayes, no opposed or abstain, unanimous, adopted motion. Congratulations! . | . | Follow ups: . | git branch naming: Kimball . | Example of how it was implemented for OpenEXR . | Kimball: haven’t actually adopted the new scheme yet due to other priorities, EXR TSC in unanimous agreement, for a development / code project, having branch names as “development” and “release” was clearer than just “main”. Even if not actually released (yet), code in the “release” branch will be less in flux than on the “development” branch. But could be fine to use the “main” branch for the EXR Image repo (no development process there). | Larry: the possible source of contention is that almost all other projects are settling on “main”, agrees on “rel / dev” is better, but being different than anyone else is a “tax on the future”, newcomers to the project will have to face a (small) hurdle. Also might be worth delaying since GitHub is offering guidance that they will offer features in a few months to help deal with branch naming issues. So if we postpone until GitHub is ready, we might avoid some initial complexity. | Kimball: more generally does it make sense to have a discussion about branching strategies across all ASWF projects? . | Nick: GitHub project pages can be used to document the branching scheme . | Kimball: happy to consider the support from GitHub . | . | slack archiving: JF . | Matrix and other LF supported paths: Andrew . | Daniel: most of discussion / advice was that although the cost of moving to commercial Slack instance (about $30K/year), the value is limited, and we should make sure to not depend on Slack as a long term archiving solution. Also a lot of our Slack use is private IMs. | Not going to request funding from Governing Board to switch to paid instance. | Can someone articulate the contrary view? Or should the LF consider alternatives to sidestep some of the limitations. | Kimball: should be an ephemeral communication, anything long term should be recorded in documentation / code. | . | . | Working Groups . | CI . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: had great meeting on mentorship process, working with LF . | Monthly D&amp;I meeting today. | Will reach out to TSC chairs to look at what mentorship projects would look like for those projects. | Daniel: lots of interest in mentorship at the TAC level . | Larry: since GSoC just wrapped, 3 TSC representatives should present on successes and challenges of GSoC projects from this summer at next TAC meeting. Although led the GSoC effort in general, don’t have specific perspective of the work performed at the project level. Daniel: will schedule this for next TAC meeting and make sure the relevant people are available. | . | Python 3 . | USD . | . | Technical Project updates . | Update on candidate projects . | WG on Collaborative Remote Review . | Last round of outward facing events, Collaborative Remote Review was identified as important industry project. | Looking for someone to take up that project: sponsor and lead the effort. Kimball: have we had previous discussion on this? Is interest, interesting but potentially challenging project. | Daniel: in all the surveys since even before ASWF creation, an open source media player / review tool was identified as a need. Clear development path, ability to embed, ease of integration… Good candidate for open source, some studios have internal tech they may want to open source. Presentation by DJV. Haven’t found a way to move beyond that stage. | WFH requirements in last 6 months has added to this need. How do you do collaborative “theater” reviews when you can’t put everyone in a theater. | Kimball: wouldn’t necessarily want to lead this group, there are people at WETA who are much more knowledgeable about in-house playback system. Daniel: sponsor does not necessarily need to be the lead, can delegate. | Daniel: up to the WG to define the scope. Kimball: will try to get something started. | Michael: there’s a bit of a chicken and egg. In this case it’s more a topic for discussion. Every studio has customized their own or third party player. So very open ended topic. | Kimball: seems the scope wouldn’t be to define an actual project, but a baseline of features required to meet this need. | Sean: are we also looking at existing projects? Kimball: yes, seems appropriate. Daniel: good topics for discussion. JT: meeting with Darby from DJV tomorrow, he would like to have more clarity as to what it would mean for a project like DJV to be involved with ASWF. So could make sense for him to get involved in this working group. | . | Datasets for testing and/or machine learning ( John M has survey ) . | https://forms.gle/3Fgg9QkjRufcYGkp6 . | John: every time a survey comes up, content / data asset repository keeps coming up and floating up the list of desired. Talking to David Morin, we should create a survey to help better define what a Creative Commons data repository would look like. Link above, please complete this short survey before EOD today. Trying to find examples out there of not just “pull only” repositories, but also ones where you can contribute. | A good topic for the creation of a working group. | A new repository of ASWF assets / logos: https://artwork.aswf.io/ . | Is a curated list of links to existing datasets be a good start? Google Doc as a way to start? Some discussion on the topic on the OTIO Slack channel. | John: trying to get an idea of the scope and focus of such a repository. “A data driven approach to a data repository” . | . | . | Next meeting . | Sept 23, 2020 | . | .

    "content": ". | First meeting in 2 months due to Open Source Days, skipping that meeting | . ASWF CI Goals for Year 2 . | GPU Build &amp; Test (success!) . | Using AWS CodeBuilder, just in time for Open Source Days / SIGGRAPH | . | Mac, Windows &amp; Linux (New focus) . | Including support for VFX Platform 2021 (recently finalized) | . | Packaging / Distribution . | Platform ecosystem . | Ties in with cross platform discussion: what is the equivalent of Docker containers for other platforms . | . | Testing with commercial components . | Leverage GitHub organization secrets | . | . Follow ups . | GPU Build &amp; Test . | OCIO success! . | Outstanding work: builds for PRs | . | Document / template example setup? . | Michael: works well, run on every branch merge. Buid on that AWS machine is very fast due to powerful platform. Runs in under 10 minutes, including all the tests. | Good assurance that the GPU build doesn’t break, especially as OCIO enters stabilization process. | Setup was straightforward once the logistics were worked out. | No build failures since, very consistent. | Andrew: build on merge, so always “behind the ball” if broken code is merged. Does OCIO get alers? Michael: you can subscribe to notifications for certain failures, but for not just keeping an eye on it. | Working out the GitHub secrets to run on a PR would be beneficial (request with GitHub). It’s on their roadmap. | 3 weeks ago GitLab added that support (forked repo can run merge requests in context of parent repo, but requestor has to be a “developer or better”, which in our case would be someone with committer rights). At least you can do it in the context of your own fork. Hopefully GitHub will have this before the end of the year. | Michael: once that’s supported it will be easy to support . | Daniel: need to document process for setting this up in template project. Point to OCIO implementation. Does require a service request to LF releng to set up the CodeBuild instance. LF releng points to the label of the (ASWF) build container to be used. | Also GitHub project configuration (requires correct access rights), just a GitHub Actions setup, and a secret attached (using an organization wide secret). Actions being used are also open source. | Almost motivation for projects to transition repos to ASWF: OTIO still under Pixar, OSL still under Imageworks (waiting for CLAs). | Larry: after breaking the OSL builds on the GPU path, started down the route of getting GPU stuff to build, wanted to use the ASWF containers without GPU, needed the NVIDIA Optix libraries, talking to Eric Enderton, looking at what it would be required to add Optix to our containers (less straightforward then the CUDA libraries): NVIDIA helping with this. | . | VFX Reference Platform CY2021 . | Mac: Min. OS version: 10.13 . | Win: Visual Studio 2017, Windows SDK v10 . | Larry: discussion about sunsetting older versions of projects called out by previous years of VFX Reference Platform. Could the projects agree on this? Driven by which version of the DCC apps are still in wide use. It would definitely be useful for project maintainers, as well as which container versions we need to keep supporting. | Position of Reference Platform is that it is currently “out of scope”, but could be tackled in the future. | Larry: would be good to know what’s explicitly “out of scope”? CMake versions? Getting all our projects to build in the same environment definitely helps. | Aloys: ASWF docker containers supports back to version 2018, since you can’t find older versions of Developer Toolset. Larry: Imageworks still has shows running older versions of Maya / gcc 4.8, that can require some complicated hacks to support. | Aloys: gets really hard to keep all the packages working, but individual packages may want to keep longer history (such as OpenEXR). Having a single container where everything works is tricky, at some point you can’t have CUDA working on older platform “year”. Larry: probably not a single answer, maybe someone has to maintain a set of 2017 libraries for Maya, but running in a modern environment. | Daniel: asking Aloys to articular some kind of proposal to the TAC, lay out the main constraints, requests such as adding clang-tidy (may require re-releasing all the images). Larry: do you need to do that? If a project requires static analysis, could be done only on the current platform. | . | ASWF-docker updates . | Aloys: OCIO / OIIO circular dependency, GitHub issue / PR. Need to not break existing assumptions from OCIO, since OCIO needs bits of OIIO (so incomplete components of OIIO in OCIO container), but tricky to do without breaking the OCIO CI image. There was a PR with some commits to help, but not done yet. | Aloys: ideal case is to break the cycle. | Michael: it would be sufficient to not build the apps in the container and break the cycle. Aloys: downstream users may expect the full OCIO / OIIO to be built. | Larry: are our containers trying to do “too much”, are they trying to be packaged artifacts, or just a CI build environment? We know that people using CI on other projects will want an OCIO with OIIO included since they write tests that expect that to work. But the stand alone binaries may be special purpose. But if users are consuming the packages as “distribution packages” it’s an other story. | Aloys: there’s a PR for a set of “runtime” containers with only the binaries, good candidates for distributing complete OCIO / OIIO utilities. Could this be a “stretch goal” to distributing all the binaries for our projects? Can also be used to drive Jupyter notebooks. This is where you would want to full versions of these projects. That work is sitting in a branch for now. Was waiting for runtime GPU support to release this. | Ticket with NVIDIA about OpenGL / CUDA Docker images since there’s a CVE against CUDA 11. So for now VFX 2021 images don’t have CUDA since need CUDA 11 for the gcc version, should happen in next few weeks. When that becomes available will rebuilt the VFX 2021 images. Would also be a good time to integrate OCIO / OIIO / OSL with CUDA 11. Larry: have tested against CUDA 11. | Docker Hub repository changes. Andrew: attempting to get ASWF under the “Open Source” program. We have “aswf”, “aswf-testing” and “aswf-?”, we would have to purchase $900 / year. Aloys: we only need to worry about retention for “aswf”, not the others. Andrew: the announcement from Docker Hub affects retention policy and number of times an image can be pulled directly (limited to fairly small number, maybe 5 per hour? day?). Could seriously affect CI if we have any number of systems. So we want to at least sign up for the $300 / yr plan. Seems like the best route. Sean: have we looked at AWS ECR? AWS could offset the cost for that. Andrew: this would work great for our CodeBuild stuff, but by default Docker won’t talk to any container registry other than Docker Hub, there are workarounds, but it is not trivial issue. Docker has gone on record that they won’t make it easy for Docker to access other container registries. It is possible to put a proxy in front of another registry, but our end consumers who may not be part of ASWF can only get our containers easily through Docker Hub. Andrew: the cost is per named user, there are team accounts, Aloys is the only developer who has direct access. The secret in GitHub Actions counts as a “user”. We can stay at a relatively inexpensive setup as long as we don’t add a lot of users with registry access. | Daniel: cost is negligible, we should go with the paid “Open Source” mode. Aloys: they count from a user point of view, even for pulls, unless they detect CI use cases, but no details provided. There may be a FAQ somewhere that states they will try to be “CI friendly”. Also a “sub layer” of a container won’t count against the pull count. Sean: a discussion in context of USD: industry as a whole could derive execution environment from the ASWF containers, is that something we would lose out on with a Docker Hub paid plan? Would we no longer be able to provide that in the long run? Andrew: this is difficult to answer right now. LF releng is tracking this issue, other LF projects are also using containers, so this is an issue that affects everyone. Should we stand up our own registry to keep older containers around so they don’t die? What should be the retention policy? Should we keep every container version we’ve ever released? . | . | . Current activities . | Windows CI . | Mac CI . | Daniel: pinged Marshall about questions of increase availability of Mac in CI environment, access to Apple Silicon based machines. | Larry: a couple of projects have gotten feedback from Apple to access Apple Silicon systems on an individual basis . | Some intricacies of how Xcode presents itself differently on different hardware . | Marshall: some investigation of what MacStadium / Orca is doing (MacOS as a VM inside a Docker container). Daniel: in practice we are just using the GitHub Actions provided Mac runners. | Daniel: some projects have contacted Apple directly, but would be good to have all ASWF projects be able to run CI builds against Apple Silicon. Larry: will become a requirement for every project, since DCCs using our projects will require native support for Apple Silicon. | Marshall: the Developer Transition Kits are the only hardware available, MacStadium does have some. Larry: Apple pointed to MacStadium, there is a program where Apple may offer credits against MacStadium for open source projects. Marshall: not part of the relationship with MacStadium. Larry: part of the “Creative Pro Relationship” (?) program at Apple. | . | Package management . | Dependencies . | Build deployment . | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Extending CI to GPU: done, further generalization desired . | Extending CI to macOS and Windows, Apple Silicon . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion goals, good progress from D&amp;I WG . | TAC leadership . | Daniel: chair tenure is now 2 years, there is no formal “maximum term”, but should be discussed . | Should we institute a regular process of reaffirming / re-electing the chair, instead of the current informal process . | . | . | Google Summer of Code Wrap Up . | Summary from the 3 projects with GSoC interns . | OpenCue (Brian): had grad student in US, worked on cloud plugin for OpenCue to manage cloud instances from OpenCue GUI. Supports GCP and Azure, AWS is in progress. Not merged yet, looking for some testers before merged into mainline. Overall went great, very beneficial to the project, establishing pipeline to bring new contributors into the project. Ended up with 20-25 applicants, about half turned into formal applications. That ended up being a big job to communicate with students and review applications, but once started it wasn’t such a big load. Wrap up took a few days, put together a blog post (see https://opencue.io blog), get code in shape. Biggest lesson was to have good material in place to bring new developers into the project: how to get started, set up dev environment, good first issues. Hopefully now that this is done, next time we need to onboard someone it will take less time. This is beneficial to the project no matter what. Could have perhaps handled 2-3 students, depending on how engaged the other TSC members are. Another lesson learned: identify potential mentors in the lead up to such a mentor, make sure they are engaged, same as identifying committers to the project. Keep in mind “who would make a good mentor”. Would like to see expanding this beyond GSoC, perhaps a summer and a winter session. Would doing it outside of GSoC might get a different kind of applicant? Some of the GSoC applicants may have been more interested in the GSoC credential rather than being actually interested in the specific project. | Eric: mentioned setting up dev environment and vetting the initial candidates. Brian: a lot of it was one time work due to newness of the project: add to add documentation for Windows setup for instance. Didn’t spend a lot of time walking potential applicants through submitting a first PR. Daniel: we required an “initial PR” as a proof of commitment, side effect may have been extra load on the TSC members. Brian: yes, but it was worth it, now have a lot of this infrastructure in place for next time. Should keep the requirement in place. | OpenEXR (Cary): imath and general usefulness to industry was raised early on by the community, languished on wishlist, but seemed like a good GSoC project. Had 3 competent applicants for the project, took on Owen Thomson from Rochester Institute of Technology, just finished program in Motion Picture Sciences, good fit. Didn’t involve writing a lot of actual code, but meant treating a lot of existing code very carefully to avoid breaking backwards compatibility. 1- creating new repo 2- moving code from existing to new repo, reorganizing, retrofitting OpenEXR cmake infrastructure, updating documentation, modernizing code (constexpr, CUDA decorators, making it compile with CUDA Half type). Exception handling, remove dependency on IEX library, clang-format, adding unit tests. Met with Owen 30 minute a week, Kimball as well, then attended TSC meetings. Set up test repo to experiment with moving code. Probably spent about 5hrs a week on this project over the course of the summer. Some of the technical skills required were C++, some of the issues are tricky, constexpr, peculiarities of CUDA. Owen was familiar with git, but needed to know more about administrator level knowledge, as well as GitHub repo management. He learned a lot about CMake and CUDA. Soft skills required: consensus building (how should the repo be structured, naming conventions, these hadn’t been fully worked out). Required flexibility, willingness to iterate, submit as a PR and deal with comments. Sometimes direct guidance would then be commented on by other OpenEXR contributors and required adjustment. What went well: the new repo is in good order, it works, no significant missteps along the way, nothing got messed up. It could have been a mess, there’s no guarantee that someone without substantial background in a long running project would be able to make this work. Showed up to all the TSC meetings, and he got a good education, engineering skills, was profitable for him. What could have gone better? Was hoping to be able to release by end of summer, but we’re not there yet. That’s more an issue with the project itself, lack of availability from core contributors, would have needed more time to reach that milestone. A suggestion to Owen in the spirit of a “performance review” at end of the summer: he wasn’t quite as communicative as could have been desired, his email communication could have been more proactive, was also hoping to use GitHub issues as a communication channel, but that didn’t end up happening as hoped for. Didn’t get as much community engagement as would have been desired. For next time: regular checkins on a weekly (or more frequent) basis are crucial, mentor must be willing to make that commitment. Should be more explicit about process to follow, set explicit milestones and deliverables, it would have been a more rewarding experience to have an actual release / milestone / deliverable at end of engagement. It is beneficial to the project, but also community engagement, we are offering an education to the student. Brian: found similar issues with communication from student. | OTIO (Joshua): very pleased with result of GSoC. Intern, Karthik, was very productive and proactive. We should emphasize the selection process at the beginning to avoid getting someone who won’t be successful. He learned a lot through the process, was able to complete main and stretch goals, as well as “surprise” PRs that he contributed. Nick spent a fair amount of time working with Karthik. Not many video calls, would have been better to have more. Nick: Karthik was amazing, on his own initiative he kept thinking of new initiatives, mocked up a proposed a PR with a compositor for the viewer. Many pleasing moments. One lesson: the project values correctness and functionality, builds that support PIP. If these had been laid out up front (for instance every new function must have a positive and negative unit test). For instance first contribution was interval algebra, requirement for test suite came as an “afterthought”, would have been better to anticipate that upfront. Another big project was wrapping OTIO APIs in C, took a fair amount of investigation since many possible approaches. The pattern he picked seemed to pass muster, he went through and wrapped hundreds of functions, but there wasn’t a design clause. Nick didn’t have a chance to inspect the design, it took a lot of time investment to check the work, validate that the tests worked, discover that some things are not obvious to a student. So “noun / verb / subject” pattern not consistent. Made a dozen a work items in response to C integration that need to be addressed outside the GSoC process due to time constraints. But still very successful, huge undertaking, he was very thorough and didn’t make mistakes. Other large project was Java bindings, lucky that contributors from Netflix provided help and guidance, they are likely to be primary consumers of the API. Karthik was able to take on all this feedback, integrate a memory management model that felt native to both C/C++ and Java. Managed to deliver this. Joshua: communication from GSoC teams: they were very strict about deadlines, regardless of current WfH situation, even for missing deadline by a few hours. Unclear what timezones times on the GSoC site are in. | OpenTimelineIO GSoC student final report . | Larry: it sounds like all 3 candidates “knocked it out of the park”, the 3 projects would likely want to do this again. 2 projects didn’t get a “slot”, one project joined ASWF too late. Should we presume we want to do this again? Should we ask for more slots? What is the limit of how many students we could take on? We don’t have to decide this now. Joshua: would not want to have more than one at a time, time commitment would be too large. Wave: was there any communication between the students across channels? Brian: possibly not. Cary: Owen mentioned there was a forum (on the GSoC side) for students to communicate with each other. Some students on other projects mentioned that they didn’t get much mentorship. Wave: might be a good idea to provide some explicit way for ASWF interns to communicate with each other. Joshua: emphasis was to incorporate Kartic in OTIO communication channels, but would be helpful to connect the students together. Brian: would make sense to create a Slack channel for next year. Carol: from D&amp;I perspective, improving this process and onboarding would help. Nick: Slack is a very useful channel for this. | Larry: great summaries from everyone, we can pick up further discussion on the TAC mailing list / Slack channel. Let’s do it again next year, expand it so that every project can get one student, unless a project decides it wants more than one student (seems a consensus that 1 is about right). | . | Follow ups . | Recommendation for VFX Platform Long-Term Support . | Larry: 8 years into VFX Reference Platform . | Multiple “walls of compatibility” . | How far back should we support? CI currently only supports a couple of years back . | Cross project dependencies (OCIO / OIIO) . | Daniel: OpenVDB has clear policy of 3 years back (2018-2020), only project with clear policy. CI supports 2018 and on via containers. | Availability of RedHat DTS for download . | Larry: does OpenVDB not issue patches for older versions? Many studios use Maya versions that still rely on gcc 4.8. Daniel: will ask OpenVDB folks explicitly. | Daniel: Any statements from other projects? . | Larry: don’t want to keep things running “forever”, can know what are the oldest versions used at his studio, but don’t know about other studios. Gordon: episodic TV clients may run very old versions. Official Autodesk position is “3 releases back”. Joshua: how do we know what’s in use out there? If we only base ourselves on big studios, does this leave smaller facilities behind? Would a survey of ASWF users would help? That would give a data point. Larry: there is “strength in numbers”, don’t want to be the only project to have a strict cutoff policy. Wave: the bigger the studio, the older the software they are locking on. A survey of ASWF organizations may give a conservative number. | Daniel: action item to look at a mechanism to gather usage / version information. | . | Vote: Policy to use non-paid Slack with guidance to move important discussions / decisions to other formats . | Document security best-practices . | . | Working Groups . | CI . | GPU support is now working for OCIO | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: series of meetings with some external university and community participants. Would like to kickstart “D&amp;I Ambassador” program, representative from D&amp;I group to attend every TSC meeting, work to get on agenda. Get a more concrete idea of what that ambassador would mean to each project. | Rachel: points made about onboarding are of interest to D&amp;I group, hoping an Ambassador could help with that process. Not just technical infrastructure but also how to make sure that new contributors feel welcome. Also ties in to mentorship initiatives, how do we open up more mentorship / internship opportunities. | Larry: having looked at all the people who applied via GSoC, a lot of national and ethnic diversity in the applicants, but very little diversity with respect to gender. May want to seed certain communities about opportunities such as GSoC. Rachel: not necessarily ready to tackle this yet, but considering how to get people in colleges interested in open source, coming up with good ideas based on conversations with university educators. Still early days on those conversations. | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: big question at the moment is around how to help unblock the transition and encourage studios to start moving. DCC vendors are “supporting Python 2 as long as clients require it”, and clients reluctant to move until forced by end of support in commercial DCCs. | What does this mean for VFX Reference Platform in terms of commercial DCC versions? . | Daniel: we now have Python 3 versions in various degrees from all the key vendors. | Ashley: the amount of discussion in the group has discussed, have gotten past the initial steps of “what do we want the group to be”, there’s less to discuss since the group is no longer in a startup phase. | . | USD . | Corey: couple of threads of discussion around self organized standards, find a way to make the WG a forum to present this work (came up in context of BIM / civil engineering work in USD). How does WG organize around that, want to make it clear this is a place for this to happen. | Role of USD in the VFX Platform, will deliver on WG minutes from 16-Sept-2020 . | . | . | Technical Project Updates . | Update on candidate projects . | Datasets . | John: results from industry survey. WG coming together to put together a potential project for ASWF to hold high quality datasets for testing. Governing Board spoke about it yesterday, putting together a Doodle Poll | . | Collaborative Remote Review . | Will spin up a WG, some people flagged their interest . | John: will put together a similar poll for this project . | . | . | Next meeting: 7 October 2020 . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | OpenCue Packaging and deployment (Brian) . | How to package Python and all dependencies into a single, installable binaries. | Discussing with John: potential issues with licensing of binary distribution? If OpenCue handles this at the project level, would likely opt to not distribute binaries, instead make it easy to build installers by the users themselves. Not ideal, but less complicated from a legal perspective. | Would be better to do this at the ASWF level rather than at the individual project level. | John: IANAL, but the gist is that there are different considerations to distributing binaries instead of source for an open source project, implications with patents and encryption. Not impossible, but extra work required. Some project communities go down that path, can implement export controls for instance. Most projects leave that as “downstream” activities to be handled by end user, vendor or Linux distribution packager. | Docker is a whole other can of worms, LF has a blog post from April 2020 on the topic. Daniel: where’s the line between artifacts, containers, and other forms of binary distributions. | John: many “unknown unknowns” in terms of licensing. | Daniel: LF can provide some experience from other projects, but we need to take this “journey” on our own. Makes sense for OpenCue not to want to do this on their own. | John: LF is more than happy to help provide guidance, and may require some degree of assistance from LF (export control infrastructure for instance for encryption). | ASWF is a larger legal target, so need to be careful. Want to make sure that assets distributed downstream are as “clean” as possible from an IP perspective. LF has projects that do binary distributions, but many projects decide not to. | Also can increase the support burden: users will expect that a provided binary gets supported. Often downstream vendors willing to take on support burden rather than the projects. | Daniel: one way to try to sidestep as many “unintended dependencies” is not to provide a “single, all inclusive” download, but instead work within an existing component manager where the other dependencies come from somewhere else. John: also good if you integrate into those ecosystems. | John: if a distribution is a Python package, which is a collection of Python scripts, so in fact you are distributing “source code” (say via Pip). So it can often be a case by case decision, likely no “one size fits all”. | Daniel: OTIO is another group talking about distributions in the context of Python. Josh: OTIO is a hybrid model, Python package via Pip, but also a C++ core, so providing Python Wheels to include pre-compiled versions of the core library. Would be helpful to get guidance as to the implications, what does OTIO need to pay attention to. All the compiled code is OTIO code , any external dependencies have been copied into the repo, rather than having implicit dependencies on a large number of external projects. This is a useful discussion for OTIO, hadn’t considered yet the implications, was mostly providing binaries as a convenience to users. | John: if any of the projects want to go down this path, can bring in Steve Winslow for some legal help, has helped with some projects before. Projects can reach out to John directly. | Daniel: immediate need from OTIO / OpenCue, so these projects can help to break some ground. | . | Follow ups . | TAC chair term / voting . | Brief discussion to formalize terms around TAC chair position. Overall feeling seems to be that it would be a good idea to have a process in place. Work with voting TAC members and John, we will vote on these changes as the TAC, and then use those mechanisms to call for a vote of the TAC to vote for a leader. | Larry: this is the 2nd anniversary, last year we had a vote, but it was informal. John: all our projects have different term limits, election last time had Daniel elected through the end of 2020, so we have some time. Ties into TAC membership renewal. Some communities decide to have these elections in December or Early January, at that point there’s a clearer picture of whether there will be membership changes that affect the TAC. | Larry: are the company membership tied to calendar years? John: yes. Eric: are there terms on Governing Board? John: no, except for general members and TAC leader. There is a position like the Treasurer, which has no explicit term limit. | . | Recommendation for VFX Platform Long-Term Support . | Daniel: Try to capture majority of use cases. | Survey on Project and Platform usage to drive with data, also capture what our projects are doing right now, but draw data input from our user base, what versions are they using, and what are their expectations. | Also not just versions, but how are they using our projects (request from multiple projects). | Question of the Python 3 upgrade window, that will stretch from this year into following years, that’s going to cause some tension / pressure. Python 3 support / requirement also helps to sunset older versions. | If anyone has interest / experience in this kind of survey, would be useful to have input. Also any analogies from other industries / foundations. | Larry: not sure how to add this to the survey, but issue of which VFX Platform year to continue supporting is important, but there may be other axis we may want to provide guidance, such as CMake versions, which are outside the scope of the Reference Platform. | Daniel: interesting list of compatibility and interoperability aspects that our projects are using, for instance API compatibility, binary data format. OpenVDB is doing some interesting work, such as ABI symbol versioning to allow swapping the version of OpenVDB which is shipped with commercial applications. Do other projects feel that this is relevant / useful? Or is this niche for OpenVDB. | Kimball: worth discussing for sure, one approach with customizable namespaces, we can change the API if we want to by putting it in a different namespace, so two versions can live side by side in separate DSOs and namespaces. Replacing a version shipped with a DCC could be very interesting. | Daniel: best practices for making isolatable dependencies fall outside the scope of the Reference Platform, but we could take on. | . | Vote: Policy to use non-paid Slack with guidance to move important discussions / decisions to other formats . | Daniel / John: how should this be phrased? John, not sure it needs to be formal? “TAC recommends to continue using the non-paid Slack, with guidance to move useful topics into other forums”. | Seconded by Kimball . | All ayes, no nays / abstains, adopted . | . | Document security best-practices . | Capture what we’ve learned from other projects, translate somewhat loose terminology from the CII badge approach to specific recommendations for current / new projects. Need a couple of individuals to take this on for the projects they have been involved with. Onus was tilting towards OpenEXR to take the first step (from previous discussions). | Cary: OpenEXR has been exposed to the issue more than anyone else since official CVEs were reported. Settled at a place where OpenEXR knows what to do to handle these, could write up a summary of what the process is, which could be useful for other projects. Daniel: yes, this would be very useful. | Cary: ASWF is not pushing on security as a primary concern, keeping our house in order is important, but no one in ASWF has demanded proactive action. | John: LF launched Open Source Security Foundation which may have some relevant info that could be applicable to our projects. Project is intended to bring a lot of expertise into a single place. | . | Kickoff: Assets Repository Working Group . | Quick discussion at the end of the last meeting . | Kick off happened earlier this week. | Eric: broad agreement that this is an interesting area, 16-17 people showed up at kickoff meeting from studios and vendors. | What does it mean? First project is to identify high level goals. Servicing goals of individual projects with datasets for testing and conformance. | But also for R&amp;D, make problems visible to the outside world. | Difference between scenes that are really used in production, with lots of cruft, substandard data, vs a cleaner / more portable dataset. Do we want “best practice” / maintained assets, or a snapshot of “real world” assets. | Assets can also be used for onboarding / mentoring students. | Hard to get assets out of studios, Moana Island scene was a success by Nick Cannon, try to remove hurdles of licensing, where is it hosted. Identify what sorts of assets would be most useful, and come up with a small set. | Meeting again in 2 weeks, Wave will lead the group. Homework exercise: look around your company and identify what could make a good asset to donate to such a repo. Working Group does not aim to build such a repo right now, but first identify what makes sense to have in such a repo. | Michael Min: git is typically not good to hold this kind of data, are we referring to an actual GitHub repo? Eric: no, just a generic idea. | Josh: frame.io volunteered to hold such a repo for editorial data. Would need to make sure this is OK with ASWF, as well as long term survival of such a repo. | . | Kickoff: Media Review . | Happening tomorrow | . | Hacktober feedback . | Do we have projects that are tagged? Daniel: no, we have some “first issues” tags, but no explicit Hacktober tags. | Did we get any of the traffic from the early onslaught? Larry: haven’t seen anything in the repos I’m involved. Cory: nothing in the USD repos. Brian: got 4-5 spam PRs, all docs changes, nothing to main repo. | Daniel: could be handled at project by project level. | . | Working Groups . | CI . | No CI working group meeting since last TAC meeting | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: working with Rachel and Emily, research meetings with some universities, met with ACM D&amp;I group to look at webinars, starting to create an intro to ASWF slide deck. Next meeting is next week. | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: not a ton of updates. Last meeting covered Python 2.7 support going forward, and what that means to the VFX Reference Platform. Group agreed that not extending Python 2.7 support officially makes sense, will make things harder for some studios, but need to prod the transition along. | Autodesk has provided an official statement on how much longer they intend to support Python 2, hoping to get the other DCC vendors to also provide such statements. | https://vfxpy.com visualizes the spreadsheet capturing the state of the migration . | . | USD . | Cory: spent last session extending discussion on role of USD in VFX Platform, help to pick a version that works with a VFX Platform year. | Discussion on ABI stability, and how integrators can avoid some of the issues coming with fast pace of change in USD. | A “universal bridge”, shim that sits on top of USD that could help integrators deal with ABI changes. | No concrete proposals yet, but may form a smaller group to discuss offline and come back with a proposal. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting: 21 October . | .

    "content": ". | First meeting in 2 months due to Open Source Days, skipping that meeting | . ASWF CI Goals for Year 2 . | GPU Build &amp; Test (success!) . | How to formalize / canonize configuration setup to make it easier to use for other projects . | JF: document in Template Project . | Other projects: adapt what was done for OCIO . | Make sure that AWS funding coming in for the GPU builder / CodeBuilder. Andrew: need to follow up, not sure for now. | . | Mac, Windows &amp; Linux (New focus) . | Packaging / Distribution . | Testing with commercial components . | . Follow ups . | GPU Build &amp; Test . | Documentation / template project? . | Optix as a dependency for OSL . | Larry: part of the driver install, missing header files . | NVIDIA provided a direct download path for header files, so can be handed at build time, the link is versioned, can pull needed version on the file. Headers are small, rest of the install (CUDA) should already be in the containers. | Should be more or less ready to go, need to figure out how to build the download link, OSL will be the example to follow. | Action: AWSF should have membership in the NVIDIA Developer Program . | . | GitHub secret sharing with PRs . | GitHub secret sharing for PR builds: GitLab is offering that functionality, no movement yet on the GitHub side | . | . | VFX Reference Platform . | ASWF Survey for window of compatibility . | Larry: VFX Platform has kept narrow focus on purpose . | Which years should we be targeting? How far back should we keep our packages updated? How far back should we test our current code? . | TAC could be a good place to give guidance to projects . | Daniel: one of the ideas floated is to try to answer some of the questions from our users via a survey. | What does a supported version mean? What can users expect in terms of “support”? . | Daniel: will bring together a group to put together the survey, especially for the CI / dependency relevant part of the survey. | Andrew: would it be beneficial for the TAC to come up with an Integration workgroup that comes up with validation tests that project integrate properly. Is there currently a test suite for the VFX Platform? Daniel: not that’s defined for this purpose. There are high level applications that pull in various ASWF / Reference Platform components. Andrew: these issues come up in other LF projects, which are composed of a number of smaller subprojects. ASWF is somewhat unique in that it is composed of single, larger, stand-alone projects. Other LF projects typically have an integration WG that works on integrating the sub projects. | LFN (Linux Foundation Networking) project has an integration project. Could have something similar for the VFX Reference Platform. | Integration projects typically only test on release artifacts, or development artifacts at specific stages. There is a team that has the specific task of this development: the current ASWF Docker Containers already are mostly there. | Daniel: running the individual unit tests of every project in a single environment could go a long way. | . | Position on versions of other common dependencies, including CMake . | Larry: build side components, dependencies not on the platform list. Are there versions that we want to link to. | . | Availability of clang-tidy etc . | Mac, Windows . | Larry: OpenEXR dependencies (for instance) become de-facto standard . | Daniel: are we trying to keep the Reference Platform as small as possible, or are we trying to define the platform in a maximum way so that guarantees compatibility across years. For compilers we want “as old as possible” compatibility, but still want to use more modern components. Artifacts such as Docker Containers need to have a clearly defined purpose. We haven’t been very clear at identifying use cases. | Larry: platform is very specific as “there shall be this version in this year”: not looking for that necessarily, but min/max versions would help. Another edge case: sometimes packages have major upgrades within a year. For instance OpenEXR, 2020 spec says 2.4, 2021 draft says 3.0, meanwhile this year’s major release of OpenEXR is 2.5, should we test against that version since it’s not part of any specific year. | Should all ASWF projects release in lockstep, following the Reference Platform? Or at least make it clear that if you want a new major release included in the platform, you have to hit a specific deadline related to new platform year versions. | Daniel: important that vendors have clarity about the dependencies they build into their platform, we can’t lose sight of the importance of defining that narrowly. | Daniel: are we running any of the component tests in the context of the Docker containers as we build them, or only running the builds? Aloys: some projects are running their test suites within our containers, and some external projects such as Walt Disney Animation partio have asked for support. Also GPU tests are running within that Docker image. | Patrick: about dependencies between Open Source Projects, there are 2 levels. One is at the VFX Reference Platform to make sure that all the projects work together, but at the project level, there is more control. OCIO for instance has more control since it can specify exactly what it is building against. Each project should have a “build against latest” to make sure that when it comes time to integrate everything into a VFX Reference Platform year, we are already mostly there. Daniel: “top of tree” builds. Patrick: doesn’t need to be a rule, but could be a strong suggestion that every build has such as “top of tree” build. Larry: I do this for my projects, not for every project dependency, but especially against top of tree of projects that are in flux. Don’t want to be caught off guard when a project does a release and haven’t been testing builds against “latest”. Patrick: OCIO does have a top of tree build. Larry: don’t do it against OpenVDB due to build costs, same for LLVM. | . | ASWF-docker updates . | CI vs runtime environment. Distribution? . | Discussion about distribution complexities at last TAC meeting . | How does redistribution of binaries trigger IP / export control issues? Does that include Docker Containers? . | Daniel: as we step into package redistribution, it makes the issue more visible. John provided some examples / links about how other LF-aligned foundations deal with it. We should try to figure out how this applies to us. | Andrew: different experiences about distribution. Most of the projects he’s worked on only distribute their own build artifacts. Containers are complex since you are building a bunch of components you didn’t build. Some foundations set up a completely different LLC organization for the purposes of artifact distribution for legal reasons. John would have more visibility into that. Distributing someone else’s artifacts always opens door to external challenges. | Aloys: we’ve definitely avoided doing some things, all our Docker images should only include open source components. Should we provide license files for everything we combine? But what about the OS dependencies? Andrew: don’t need to provide all the licenses included in the base container image. Aloys: we do add a number of packages to the base distribution package. | Andrew: should be fine release as is as long as you are just pulling additional packages from upstream source. The distribution is already doing what they need to do to protect IP, and make sure that packages included in the distribution can be freely redistributed and don’t include those in their repos (hence additional repositories such as EPEL). | Andrew: if we were to generate a container with “difficult” dependencies such as ffmpeg, we would be stepping into murky waters. A flag to automatically instead that dependency rather than include it would be better. | Aloys: the list of packages is in a single place, so easy to review. | . | VFX2021 / CUDA11 . | Aloys: still an issue, unfixed problems. NVIDIA has released CentOS 7 images but not every one, missing the nvidia/cuda-opengl container. Have an open ticket with NVIDIA, we don’t necessarily care so much about CVEs since there’s no sensitive code inside those Docker images. | Focussing on more clang / LLVM variants in the Docker images, working with Larry and Nick from OpenVDB. Working on clang 6-7-8-9-10 variants on selected VFX platform years. Larry likes to be able to build the code with various compilers, currently has to do under Ubuntu. | Aloys: was about to release all the compilers, but clang 7.1.0 just released, and fixes a bug affecting OpenVDB, so will re-release the containers with that clang version. | Hoping this will fix OpenVDB clang 7 test suite crash. | . | Docker Hub repository changes. | Hoping to have those containers this week, but having weird timeout errors on GitHub Actions pulling packages. Could be related to new limits imposed by GitHub Actions? It looks like everything is now slower to pull large Docker images. | Pulling vfx-all taking 3.5 min . | Larry: are they throttling our bandwidth? Aloys: Docker Hub is likely trying to throttle everyone’s bandwidth / storage. | Daniel: any clarity on how policy changes at Docker Hub are affecting us? . | Andrew: haven’t heard back about application for open source, we may want to go ahead and purchase an account. We will need to make sure that all the ASWF repos are using account credentials to avoid impact. But projects outside the ASWF github repo would still be hit by throttling limits. | Aloys: we already have credentials in ASWF-docker project. Andrew: would need to use credentials for pulls instead of doing anonymous pulls. | Andrew: will start with the “smallest team”, should be around $300/year. | Aloys: aswf account is used on Docker Hub . | Looks like latest builds just went through . | . | . | Mac CI . | Is it possible to have more control over the Mac Agent build environment on GitHub Actions (since we don’t have Docker containers available). Building in a “historical” environment vs in a “latest environment” with backward compatibility. | Larry: use Homebrew install on Mac, but that’s always “latest” and has pros and cons . | MacStadium / Developer Transition Kits . | Various early access programs, targeted to individual developers / companies, anything targeted to organizations like ASWF? . | Marshall: the MacStadium Open Source program (opensource@macstadium.com) and for qualified OSS projects, you can contact them and they have DTKs available they can add to your account at no cost for your project. That’s the only DTK program available for open source projects and which is freely available. | Larry: had a call with Apple, Apple had already build OIIO and in process of building OSL, sent PR for OIIO, Larry hadn’t heard back from MacStadium since initial contract, but got prompted and should be in the process of being resolved. | Daniel: any examples of GitHub Actions workflows with DTK? Andrew: no other projects at LF currently using Apple DTK. | Orka Integration with GitHub Actions | . | Marshall: the MacStadium DTK access may actually allocate dedicated hardware (access via Orka). | Larry: not clear how crucial this setup is, by the time the hardware is widely available, GitHub should have added it as an option for public runners. Main point of using MacStadium so that our projects are “ready to go” when Apple Silicon runners become available via GitHub Actions. | Daniel: so doing ad-hoc builds and fixing specific issues should be sufficient at this stage, as opposed to builds on every updates? . | Larry: can depend on the project, and how much trouble it would be to set up. It’s not that radically different an environment. PR submitted by Apple for OIIO was pretty minor, package has already been ported to ARM on Linux. On OSL it will be more extensive because of the use of LLVM targeting x86, never exercised targeting ARM as the JIT target, so could have more potential for breakage without continuous testing. | Daniel: would it be enough of an incremental value add to justify setting up Orka. Larry: we would like to be able to move there, if anything to solve the versioning issue on Mac. Daniel: there seems to be enough value to go there. We need someone who has time to do this. | Larry: trying to get access to a DTK project on behalf of OIIO / OSL, but it is speculative. | JF to prototype integration between an ASWF project and Orka build (there is a GitHub repo demonstrating this integration) . | Marshall: check out the MacStadium open source project page . | . | . | Package management . | Dependencies . | Build deployment / runtime environment . | . | . Action Items . | Larry/Daniel: NVidia Developer Program membership for ASWF to officially access Optix headers . | JF/Andy: MacStadium account setup (ASWF and Open Source program) and GitHub Actions integration for Orca and DTK testing . | Andy/Aloys: Docker Hub ASWF account (paid or via opensource application) to avoid restrictions . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Follow ups . | Survey: project usage, dependencies: Daniel, Emily . | Gather project specific questions that have come up repeatedly, affecting our CI project, how we manage dependencies, how we address security issues (OpenCue / OpenTimelineIO, trying to cross the CII badge process). | Useful start from work done by OpenCue for a project specific survey, reached out all all project TSCs to formulate questions specific to their project, as well as questions common across the projects (support for historical versions of VFX Platform for instance). | Current State of Survey . | Want to start survey in Early November, don’t delay the work already done by OpenCue. Want to follow up on this annually so we can provide an annual update. Also good for the annual ASWF cycle, show / indicate progress in our ecosystem to our members. | What could we do as action items based on these answers? . | Emily: will help with the process of submitting the survey. Will work with John to refactor common questions. Would be good to provide specific examples, such as “what software do you use” under OpenColorIO. Good to have Yes/No or multiple choice answers. Daniel: can always have an “other” option. | John has set up a SurveyMonkey account. Would be good to have a branching strategy so people can easily skip sections not relevant to them. Similarly for whether survey takers are OK with sharing diversity info. | Larry: would be useful to have basic info such as “developer/user”, “studio / independent / vendor”? Good to identify our “core constituency”. Emily: yes, will have identifying info, but optional to allow anonymous contribution. Larry: would still be useful to have some anonymous answer such as “studio vs independent”. | Eric: are we looking for a per-studio answer? Emily: more individuals, “the more the merrier”. | Daniel: OpenCue survey may have been written with a more targeted audience? Brian: yes, initially written with a “one response per deployment” target. Can always deduplicate based on company name. Emily: not clear how to regulate this. Eric: concerned that users won’t fill a survey that takes more than 5 minutes. Current state is much more than that, few respondents would know answers to all the questions. | Larry: is this just a wishlist? At first glance it looks overwhelming. | Daniel: we should do a cost/value evaluation, can use UI design to “hide” some of the size of the survey? Can we offer some kind of (intangible) reward? Emily: projects should rank their questions, should be 5-7 per project at most, and multiple choice is better. Can always provide a “reach back to me for further discussion” entry. | Brian: this is already the “trimmed down” version, and has mostly multiple choice questions. Were hoping to get contact info from the survey so they could reach out to respondents. | Daniel: need to find right way to present this. Larry: project leaders should look at their questions and answer “would you change the course of development based on answers”, and if the answer is no, maybe that question can be dropped. | Daniel: Ken from OpenVDB : question about “why are you not using a project” can be useful as well. Maybe we do need to split into broad based vs more targeted. | . | Packaging and deployment (OpenCue, OTIO): Brian . | Started email discussion, no conclusions yet | . | Security best practices . | OpenEXR process summary: Cary (absent) | . | . | Technical Project updates . | Via slack: Contribution of rust bindings for projects | . | Working Groups . | CI . | Details of next incarnation of VFX Reference Platform, relationship to CUDA, OptIX, how to access those components that require signing EULAs for downloads. | How to facilitate distribution of projects without getting lost in minefield of binary distribution (licensing, IP, export controls). Already in that territory somewhat with Docker images. | Consideration of how to use Docker Hub in the future, may need to sign up for a paid account to not have to deal with throttling of free tier (slower CI builds due to delays of pulling ASWF containers from Docker Hub). | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Rachel: having conversations with universities, how can students learn more about Open Source, learned a lot about how universities understand Open Source. Several professors joining the D&amp;I WG. | Ambassadors from projects: identified 4, looking for 2 more, this person will join project discussions with specific perspective of D&amp;I. | Will join TSC meetings to present the ambassador program. | Blog initiative is making progress, list of topics we want to cover, putting dates against these topics, first publish targeted next month on aswf.io blog. First one is “language in code”, next is “unconscious bias”. | List of proposed topics . | Emily: looking for volunteers . | Rachel: working on a webinar series, recorded, available for college age students. Followed by series of career based webinars. | JF: could leverage facility HR teams? Emily: yes, trying to reach out, but webinar wants to present to comp sci grads what are the different career paths, what skills are needed, and which open source communities can help develop these skills. Facility HR teams such as DNeg are already participating. | Wave: lots of facilities have internal web pages / blogs, could get ASWF D&amp;I blog posts onto some internal blogs. Could be possible to get our content “shopped out” to a lot of companies. Helps to get people in these large companies to know more about ASWF. | Emily: once webinar series is kicked off, there will be a page on the ASWF web site, including a D&amp;I section, but need content first. | Wave: there’s an internal “Open Source at Apple” site for instance. | Rachel: similar to conversation with SIGGRAPH, how we could partner and share resources / sources. | Wave: there are opportunities to reuse work, and establish contacts. Carol: a lot of the work is establishing connections, so this could be really useful, welcome any contacts on who to talk to at various companies. | Emily: for D&amp;I committee, scope is so large, trying to focus on students for now, somewhat younger demographic. Will develop material that can be reused later on, but current focus is mostly students. | Rachel: ways to reuse the same work. Michael: just hired a new intern, so material that targets interns in companies can be useful. Rachel: working on a package of information that can be delivered to professors. But yes, eventually could target that info with SIGGRAPH, companies (same material, different packaging). | Emily: blog content can definitely be repackaged. If you know about existing content that could be reused, please share it. | Have been using a public Google Driverather than a repo, also a shared calendar, good “source of truth”. | . | Python 3 . | USD . | Cory: USD’s role alongside the VFX Reference Platform, which part should be useful for who . | Idea of a “universal bridge”, need concrete ideas, there have been ideas for proposals to the group, such as how NVIDIA Omniverse does extensions. | A couple of additional proposals: NVIDIA + Pixar physics scheme, what are the motivations. | Still TBD for scheduling, but working on a presentation agenda for coming working group meetings. | Next meeting start of November . | . | Assets . | Meeting yesterday . | Eric: Rob Bredow shared experience of how to publish the Moana data set. Details of licenses, looked at some assets already out there, “Hyper Space Madness”, “Sony Zombie Rig”. Some people shared projects under way at their studios. | Interested in estimating hosting cost, how big would contributed projects be. “What was the first reason an exec said no when you suggested contributing”? . | Meeting notes . | Michael: Next meeting is Election Day in the US, should we move it forward a week or a week after? Eric: OK with any option. Probably don’t want to change the cadence. Can discuss on mailing list and figure out the next meeting. | Larry: plea to make sure that everyone is included on the mailing list. Please everyone interested should join the mailing list. | John: can provide Confluence space if required for a wiki . | . | Review . | Daniel: WG focussed on scope and mission, still in “WG scoping phase”, will likely take a little while to set up the infrastructure. | “Our WIP goal statement is “ The Purpose of this working group is to investigate and define areas of relevance and interest for the Academy Software Foundation to participate in the support of a publicly available open source playback and review system targeted at the media and entertainment industry.”We anticipate generating a report and recommendations to the TAC and Board with those opportunities enumerated. We are currently aligning on scope, by trying to define the attributes and expectations of a complete system, then narrowing to what requirements might fall within the scope of a playback device.We are currently iterating on the definitions of those attributes and a collection of user stories to identify the audience for any future recommendation.” . | . | Rust bindings . | Larry: started on OpenImageIO discussion, multiple attempts at writing Rust bindings for OIIO. A lot of the work for C++ projects is to write a simplified C binding around the C++ API, then you can add a other languages relatively trivially. | Joshua: C bindings, then Java bindings for OTIO was a GSoC project. But concern about testing load, but best if a single official implementation is used. But who will maintain it? If there is a community that is motivated to support those (Rust) bindings, then it’s worth doing if there’s a real user base. | Larry: would be happy to adopt this in OIIO, but only if there are people committed to maintain and develop it. Several people volunteered themselves, but revealed they had already started on projects. There are industry people who are very enthusiastic about Rust. | Joshua: trying to put these repos in a separate repos that sub-modules the main one, so not limited in releasing OTIO versions because the bindings aren’t up to date for instance (not have to be in lockstep). | Daniel: how do we encourage this, do we create a working group? Or a per project basis? JT: project by project, if the developer is enthusiastic about Rust, but not a big movement to Rust in independent space. | Larry: intrigued by it, but not written Rust yet due to lack of library support, “chicken and egg” situation. | Invite person who proposed it to next CI meeting, help with administrative aspect of crate registration. | Kimball: for OpenEXR, redoing core as C to help make bindings to multiple languages. | Patrick: looked at OCIO, discussion of having new bindings is really interesting, but has a cost in development, also we need to provide infrastructure, documentation, unit tests. Should be seen as a project, investigate the use case, what are the consequences of doing this. OCIO has another binding (Java) and third party code, but no knowledge or CI support, so not supported in V2 OCIO. If you have a “one shot” contributor, this can be an issue, consumers of the project will expect continuing support of an additional language binding. It increases the effort to add new APIs / functionality to projects if you want to do it correctly (API headers, test cases, documentation…). | Daniel: having a compact C API helps with reuse (as OpenEXR is doing). Patrick: most of the projects have C++ API, adding a C API, that’s another interface to support. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting: Nov 4 2020 . | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Documentation | . | Discussion on channels . | Daniel: Slack seems to have been quite successful, do we agree on that? Are we OK with the risk of ‘spreading the discussion too thin’? . | Larry: still see substantive discussions happening that may not be captured elsewhere, not just ephemeral discussions. For example what’s happening in the rust channel. | Nick: trying to aggregate conversation into GitHub repo issues . | Daniel: exactly the conversation we want to have, we can come back specifically for the rust discussion later in the meeting. Also good discussion on the documentation front. Opportunity for cross-project cooperation. We want to put in place best practices. | Also issues with calendars . | . | Security Guidance (Cary) . | https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-sample-project/pull/17 . | Most recent discussions on security requirements came up in context of OTIO and OpenCue . | Cary: two main categories in CII requirements: . | Cryptographic requirements: most ASWF projects don’t have those, except perhaps OpenCue . | Security vulnerabilities: a vulnerability is really just a “bug”, with some caveats. What to do when your project coredumps, or more to the point, what to do when someone finds out your project coredumps, with the additional context of public disclosure. Especially important for projects that implement a file format, ability of attackers to craft a malicious file. Projects that read file, especially projects that are widely used, not just in a studio behind a firewall. But OpenEXR is part of macOS, any software that is used in that context needs to take vulnerabilities very seriously. The mechanism of public disclosure serves the purpose of allowing users of software to track which versions of a software project have the vulnerability. CVEs are a global system to reference vulnerabilities. A CVE ID can be given out by an organization that is registered as a “CVE Numbering Authority”, several companies act as such: Google, Autodesk, The MITRE Corporation is the overall manager of this project, and the “CVE Numbering Authority of last resort”. Getting a CVE ID is simple: you fill a form on the MITRE web site, not completely automatic, since there is a manual review process before the CVE is actually created. Primary context where this is relevant when someone in the public announces to a project they have discovered a vulnerability, having a CVE ID allows tracking that a specific version reported is fixed in which version(s). OpenEXR had a variety of experiences, CVE was filed, no one paid attention (part of the origin story of ASWF). As soon as OpenEXR was transferred to ASWF, the issue was fixed, updated the project documentation, and the CVE documentation on the MITRE web site. | Also got a couple of reports from “security researchers”, who seem to be people who spend full time looking for bugs. Someone presented a file that crashed OpenEXR and required we filed a CVE on their behalf. CVEs aren’t a “bad checkmark” against a library, it shows a diligence about security issues. Bug was fixed, requested CVE ID, new version was released, mentioned CVE in release notes, and notified researcher of CVE ID. | Fuzz testing: process of identifying corrupted / potentially malicious input data that causes crash / misbehavior on load. OpenEXR has had a fuzz testing in its test suite a long time ago. Was approached by Goggle’s ossfuzz project, thought about it for a while, then decided to do it. Google servers generated “random” EXR files and try to load them, and reports bugs when something is detected. Compiles code with -fsanitize command line option. A lot of these reports are “hard to believe” could ever be an exploitable vulnerability, so a certain amount of busy work to be expected, but several actual bugs were found. So the recommendation would be to adopt ossfuzz. Tests the software “along the edges”: test bizarrely sized images for instance. Reports from ossfuzz has slowed down to a trickle, Peter Hillman did a lot of the work to address these. | Tarball signing: back in the days OpenEXR was hosted on GNU savannah, tarball can be signed using GPG on upload, users can download tarball and signature and confirm that the tarball matches the project signature. Somewhat of an archaic process, most projects currently rely on the GitHub release page / process. OpenEXR still does this manually based on request from one of the Linux distros that requested it. So don’t necessarily see this as still very important, but it’s also not a lot of overhead. | There are many other security issues that OpenEXR hasn’t encountered, and may be encountered by OpenCue due to the network centric nature of the project. | . | Daniel: do projects still in incubation have any specific questions on this topic? . | Joshua: a great step forward, very clear, OTIO can learn from this. Thank you! . | . | Rust Bindings (Nick) . | Share the process happening around the Rust discussion, and how it should go forward, points of contact with existing projects, and welcome to new people. | Nick: initiative being taken, something new that generates a lot of enthusiasm. A lot of movement recently in language bindings. C bindings created for OCIO and OTIO (Java as well). Scott saw opportunity to have a consistent look and organization of Rust bindings for VFX projects. Registered a number of Rust “Crates” (packages) names. Conversations started in Slack. At first was unclear what was the best way to host these conversations, created #rust channels, and created a GitHub repo, for now an independent GitHub organization to bootstrap the project, if it pans out, can bring back to TAC. Scott has done a lot of work looking for CLAs, Code of Conduct… Seems to be evolving into what could be a process for nascent community projects. Would be great to have templates that could be used for these projects. Work being done on the GitHub repo could lead to such templates. | Larry: it’s amazing how quickly this exploded from 2 people on OCIO to 40 people on a Slack channel, ambitions are to make comprehensive bindings for a large section of the core VFX projects, all the way up to USD Rust bindings. | Nick: Anders took automatic binding framework, what if ASWF projects had a standard adornment for exported APIs that would make automatic generation of bindings robust. | Scott: motivation came out of a discussion on 3d-pro, decided to start wrapping OIIO, want to see more Rust in the industry, Rust is potentially a better language than C++ in the future for the industry. | Daniel: was the aswf-sample-project useful to this process at all? . | Nick: they should be correlated and cross referenced, might need to take more initiative on some topics, such as “is it appropriate to create your own slack channel”, “what are Wiki resources available (not a lot of statements as to the purpose of the Wiki)”. Should Rust activity belong in the ASWF Wiki, or in a repo-specific Wiki? . | Daniel: should bindings live outside the project repos, or in the projects themselves? In the context of OpenEXR, it could be messy to have bindings “out in the wild”, should C bindings be pulled in to projects as core part of the project? . | Joshua: there’s a tension between “should the bindings be included in our project or a separate thing”. Worry about adding more burdens on the release process. For now the thought is that the bindings should at least be a separate repo, and use the submodule mechanism. In fact would like to factor out existing bindings in the project and move them out. | Nick: interesting point about Java, the core team doesn’t spend a lot of time on Java, could get stuck fixing a core problem, reaching out to Java expertise . | Larry: counter point is that if the bindings are separated out, user doesn’t know if a problem is in the bindings, in the core, or version mismatch between bindings and core. Core developers are likely still going to be burdened by problem reports. If someone does the original work, test suite tests the bindings, and additional work is mostly “cut and paste”, could still be tractable without deep expertise. Also bindings could be covered in the core documentation. | Nick: since there aren’t existing Rust bindings (as opposed to Python bindings that have grown in ad-hoc ways), there’s an opportunity to set standards for Rust bindings for all ASWF projects, would relieve a lot of maintenance burden if all the projects do it the same way. | Wave: would love to see Swift bindings (from an Apple perspective), would be very straightforward to automatically generate from C bindings. | Gordon: seems that this is heading towards a discussion of language adoption in the industry, are we seeing specific trends, studios heading in certain directions. Is this a good discussion topic for this group, opportunity for another survey? Would be very useful for vendors. Could be address in community survey. | Kimball: for OpenEXR, would be convenient to have C bindings, and a chance to make structure changes to the performance of OpenEXR, so was the trigger to start working on C bindings. Makes other language bindings simpler / trivial. WETA compiles most of its own software internally, often have customized copies, use namespace to create custom namespaces. Doing that for C, which could be considered “weird”, if this is useful, we should have an agreement about these approaches, to allow users to override symbols when they need to. | Daniel: as a complement to the VFX Reference Platform, tackling namespace would help components to cooperate. | . | Documentation efforts across projects (Daniel) . | Daniel: a lot of effort in OCIO, also effort in OSL, any other projects? . | Kimball: OpenEXR as well, OTIO as well . | How much integration / cooperation / best practices can we establish across these efforst . | Larry: can’t go wrong with what OCIO did, they spent a lot of time debating the right approach and tools, but the result is very clear, IMHO would have to have a strong reason to not just adopt their methodology. | Michael: reached out to the community, got a lot of contribution, large group of different contributors. System seems fairly effective. | Larry: lesson from OCIO is that it’s not a single person effort, had a separate committee for documentation, with new / different contributors, brought writing skills, graphic design skills. It was a big production, it takes effort to make documentation that nice. | Cary: working on documentation for IMath, found a “hello world” project for Doxygen / Sphinx / …which was very helpful. Did struggle with Sphinx and Breathe, they are complex in the way they deal with templates. | Daniel: is there “hidden knowledge” from OCIO that could be shared? . | Michael: one of the bigger challenges was the workflow of how to have documentation live in one place of your source tree, for instance info from C++ headers end up in documentation for Python bindings. Establishing this pipeline was complicated. Some contributors found / developed some graphs demonstrating the workflow. At first it was somewhat overwhelming, but focussed on developing a Table of Contents that everyone agreed to in a Google Doc, once we established the scope of the work, it was possible to dole out the work. Also had a deadline (SIGGRAPH), helped to get most of the work done in a month, now there’s mostly cleanup left to be done. | Daniel: would be good to highlight key discoveries and processes. | Larry: any documentation on the tooling that was used would be helpful, a single Markdown file that highlights it all would help. | Michael: also developed some custom Python tools that helped, not specific to OCIO, for instance a library to parse Doxygen XML that can be imported into PyBind11, matches a subproject of PyBind11 but doesn’t require clang. | Larry: these tools could also be used internally at studios, useful and good looking documentation is always a challenge . | . | Survey (Daniel) . | Still hoping to follow through with survey, goal is still “early November”. Aim for next TAC meeting. | . | Technical Project updates . | Working Groups . | CI . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Rachel: Working on first blog posts . | Meeting with Governing Board . | . | Python 3 . | RV 2021.0.0 released with Python 3 support . | (Ashlie from Slack): The Python 3 working group has been looking at a Python 3 guide from WDAS and whether we can extract parts of it to include in our own deliverables and documentation about Python 3. We’ve also found issues with Qt related segfaults which we thought were caused by Python 3, but may actually be due to Qt 5.12 and it being more strict about memory management. So many bad behaviors we were getting with away before now seem to be causing segfaults in Qt 5.12. | . | USD . | No meeting since last TAC meeting | . | Assets . | Review &amp; Approval . | . | GSoC Mentor Summit . | Cary: 2 sections, lightning talks (3 min per organization), our 3 minute was a “plug” for ASWF, mentioning projects and students. | Second session was breakout sessions on topics on how to be a better mentor, how to introduce your student to the organization, but didn’t have time to attend. Seemed to be more oriented towards organizations with little experience with mentoring process. | Very international event, a lot of the participation was from India, if it had been in person, would have been possible to talk to people directly, but didn’t get much out of it outside of giving ASWF presentation . | Next year the structure of GSoC is changing (shorter scope projects), hopefully by that stage we have some of our own mentoring programs in place. | . | Next meeting . | 18 November 2020 . | .

    "content": "ASWF CI Goals for Year 2 . | GPU Build &amp; Test (success!) . | Mac, Windows &amp; Linux (New focus) . | Packaging / Distribution . | Testing with commercial components . | . Follow ups . | GPU Build &amp; Test . | Nvidia EULA for Optix SDK headers? (Daniel) . | Discussion via email . | Larry: NVIDIA provided download link, but no clarity on license? New Optix doesn’t have separate libraries, relies on CUDA libraries, just missing the headers. Really a question for NVIDIA. | . | Document OCIO setup in Template project (JF) -&gt; not done yet . | Any updates on GitHub secret handling? Andrew: no updates on that front. | . | ASWF-docker updates . | VFX2021 / CUDA11 . | Aloys: lots of changes got released yesterday, seem to be breaking some workflows, Larry ran into issue with lack of namespace for environment variables to determine which version of components are exposed. Re-releasing containers with ASWF_ prefix for all environment variables, should fix the issue. | Updated to CUDA11, NVIDIA released updated base images, so VFX 2021 images are based on CUDA 11.1. Added proper license assignments in each package, updated Blosc which was quite far behind, but that broken OpenVDB, waiting for feedback as to which version they want. | Every Docker image has a README, and every image has full documentation in Docker Hub. Also make it clear that “ci-openvdb” doesn’t include OpenVDB, but is meant to built OpenVDB. Internally all images are based on Jinja2 templating. Also made available aswfdocker via PyPi, should be possible to generate your own ASWF images on demand. Tried to download PyPi package on Linux, seems to work fine, haven’t tried on other platforms. Wanted to reserve the ASWF name. | Daniel: good to make things more explicit based on questions / feedback. Acknowledging the grey area that Docker images reside in as binary distributions. | Aloys: some Docker images are “empty containers” that only contain the packages. Qt includes a long list of licenses, smaller packages are simpler. Header files may also include license copies. | aswfdocker is starting to look like a (very simple) package manager, considering how complex it should get before that’s “too far”. There’s a versions.yml that contains all the versions of packages included in a container, may add a proper dependency tree between packages, right now everything is just a flat list. Would be useful to capture that knowledge. Should be possible to keep the scope limited, we only need to manage the packages we are interested in. | Daniel: lots of thought and design behind Docker images, is the design clear enough from what’s in the repo, or should we provide documentation in the repo or in our Wiki? Aloys: would need more documentation for the aswfdocker tool, added a section in the CONTRIBUTING file as to how to release containers. It’s hard to know what people actually need. Daniel: can be easier to contribute to documentation separate from the repo? . | . | Docker Hub repository changes. | Application for Open-Source status? (Andrew) | . | . | . Andrew: only update relies to containers: haven’t gotten on Open Source Docker Hub program yes, other project has done it, but the Open Source program doesn’t look that promising. Anyone pulling from your open source namespace doesn’t count against your quota, but doesn’t help if you are pulling from other images. But still worth getting ASWF onto that program. Also initiated process of setting up a paid for account, once we are upgraded, our account should have any locations, same for Aloys account (part of that team). No clear correlation with some performance issues experienced during CI builds. Charges will come as a standard pass-through charge to ASWF. | Mac CI . | MacStadium / Developer Transition Kits . | JF to prototype integration between an ASWF project and Orka build (there is a GitHub repo demonstrating this integration) Ideas around the concept of a media creation company in the WFH era . | Looking at using Vagrant + Virtual box to provide similar experience to Linux “build in Docker container” model . | Andrew: should we use Packer instead? LF has library of Ansible playbooks that target using Packer . | Daniel: building VMs for various versions of macOS may cause some licensing restrictions. Orka sidesteps licensing restrictions. | Marshall: check out the MacStadium open source project page JF: I’ve (just now) filled out the form, waiting for feedback. Daniel: requirements from MacStadium may rule us out. | Andrew: LF releng has managed MacMinis at MacStadium before, can be done, but team doesn’t have a ton of macOS expertise. Can be set up as a pass through cost to ASWF, allow the community to do the management. Whatever works best for the community. | Daniel: initial LF CI system was quite involved, hard to know where to start, may make more sense to start with the community, then hand over to LF releng. | . | . | Package management . | Dependencies . | Build deployment / runtime environment . | . | Project feedback . | Michael: everything is good with OCIO, GitHub Actions revised their policies so that Actions on forks will disable themselves after a certain duration of inactivity. Larry: can be turned back on, an “opt in” model. OCIO: some contributors would get emails that their Actions failed because of this, could lead to some confusion. | . | . New Items . | Created wiki space: https://wiki.aswf.io/display/CIWG . | Good place to capture useful information, especially from Slack . | May recreate to match other projects . | Andrew: some other communities are using Confluence Wiki for meeting minutes, then lock the page once the meeting minutes are finalized. Confluence has a meeting minutes template. Daniel: lots of Confluence expertise at other studios. | . | We haven’t done much for Windows yet . | Docker? Similar VM-based approach to Mac? | . | How do our projects interactive with distributions, package managers . | How could we leverage existing package managers to get fine grained version control . | Michael: aren’t we supposed to get a S3 bucket for arbitrary storage needs? Daniel: yes, we have one. Michael: OCIO would have a use case for artifact storage, would need this for some of their documentation workflows. | Brian: using that bucket in their CI to pass artifacts between CI stages. Andrew: it’s a private bucket, so won’t be able to access artifacts without the credentials (OCIO wouldn’t be able to access from ReadTheDocs for instance). No URL access, need to access with credentials. | Andrew: ReadTheDocs has an option to access pre-rendered material (RST format). Michael: currently testing that as a solution. Andrew: v3 API for ReadTheDocs allows building sub sites as needed. | . | ASWF Survey: Michael, there was a question as to which package managers should be supported by projects? Would be useful to know. Daniel: should be making progress on the survey soon, should be able to share an update later today. | . Action Items . | Do we have enough bandwidth / interest to tackle Windows? JF: will try to keep VM-based investigations for macOS to be as platform independent as possible. Andrew: there were some configurations to build on OpenStack on VEXXhost, could stand up a server on VEXXhost (need Semi Annual Channel version of Windows Server). Does AWS CodeBuild have Windows builders? Yes, so that could be an option. | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Documentation . | CI on Mac, Windows . | JF: MacStadium has provided a Intel-based dedicated Mac Mini for our CI builds and test, Apple Silicon Mac Minis available soon | . | . | New member welcome . | Mark Visser, Unity Technologies | . | Follow ups . | ASWF Calendar invite resynching (Daniel, John) . | Communication and calendar processes doc PR . | JF to submit fixes to issues, or can suggest fixes that the owner of the PR can accept (Michael) . | Specific bits around subscribing to calendars using various calendar tools, best practices around calendar management. | . | Documentation best-practice from OCIO (Michael) . | Michael: OCIO planning to document its documentation process so it can be shared with other projects | . | ASWF TAC chair annual election process (Daniel) . | Getting close to this, aligning mandate with calendar year. John: suggesting start Nov 30th, opening nominations on Monday Nov 30th, close on Dec 7th, hold election on Dec 9th-16th, announce result on Dec 18th. Animal Logic will downgrade its membership at beginning of the year, so we will need to find a new chair. | . | ASWF Project and Technical Community Survey (John). Emily out this week, will work on it next week. Found some common themes in questions, should be able to push it out soon. JF: any target for the time to fill out the survey? John: want to keep it short, but also cover 6 projects. Each project section limited to 3-5 questions, for background / high level questions, looking at around 10-15 questions. Concern around survey length, can lose people midway through. | . | Technical Project updates . | OCIO: Michael: still working on documentation. Preparing beta release of OCIO v2, not ready for RC yet, but want to have versions that people can test and track rather than just following master branch. Discussions around remaining features, how they will be implemented, while satisfying opinions from studios and stakeholders. | OpenCue: Brian: not too much, keen to see survey move along / answers. What about the Python packaging questions that were brought up in previous meetings? Discussions with OTIO group: there isn’t a ton of overlap between the two projects, trying to accomplish somewhat different goals. OTIO focussed on developer environments, OpenCue more towards end users of a GUI app. But also looking at legal / licensing issues around packaging dependencies, which seems more relevant for OpenCue. | OpenEXR: Cary: Kimball has merged all the major code reorg into master branch, big step towards 3.0 release: same functionality, but reorganized and linking around external imath library. Larry has gotten OIIO linking against this. Path for projects that also need to link against previous versions of OpenEXR and need to maintain compatibility against multiple versions of OpenEXR. Larry: changes in the recent trunk in OpenEXR are such that if you check out “top of trunk” OpenEXR, it may bring out build system issues. OpenEXR list is the place to ask for help, trying to make transition easier for people. CMake target names have changed, code is split into two repos. Don’t be surprised! . | OSL: Chris: not a lot to update, making some strides to involve more people in documentation effort, looking closely at what OCIO has done. Fingers crossed that the CLA will be accepted and hoping to move forward, but things are moving very slowly. | Joshua: no major updates from OTIO . | OpenVDB: no updates . | . | Working Groups . | CI . | See above | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Rachel: can follow along at the content calendar. | 2 major initiatives: blog posts, first post on inclusive language, and what language shouldn’t be used in code, should be posted soon. Hopefully useful resource for people and companies looking at these issues. Second blog post in December on unconscious bias, how it permeates specifically open source and vfx/animation industry. | Second initiative is webinar series targeting student education goal. Trying to pull together a first introductory webinar in February, working with universities and professors, how to grab the attention of students. Introduce open source and its use in our industry, as well as introduce the ASWF. Planning to follow up with a series centered around careers, looking at names of peoples in different technical careers in our industry. Highlight different people and their career paths, as well as what hiring managers are looking for when looking at prospective candidates. | Ambassador initiative: a person in D&amp;I group assigned to each project in ASWF, will participate to these projects, but through the perspective of D&amp;I. Have identified people for every project but one. | . | Python 3 . | Ashley (via Slack): we are still focusing on expanding the best practices document that we have using the Python 3 guide from WDAS. We will also be getting some best practices specific to converting Python bindings in C++ to support Python 3 courtesy of SideFX. | . | USD . | Review &amp; Approval . | Asset Repository . | Wave: Eric from NVIDIA brought colleague Aaron to present about NVIDIA (ORCA - Open Research Content Archive). Can be quite expensive to take in an asset. Got assets from Amazon (Bistro), foliage from Speedtra, C4D, Epic. One third of assets haven’t been released yet due to work required to clean up and prep. Cautionary tale: we will need to put resources in, members volunteering time, contractors. NVIDIA had both engineering and intern resources assigned. | Hoping to discuss at next meeting what kind of asset repository the ASWF would want to have. The more we dig into it, the clearer it is that it would be a big commitment. “It’s harder than it looks” is the general feedback. | Putting up slides on Wiki by end of tomorrow. | . | . | Update on candidate projects . | Kimball: Alex from Academy and Kimball will present effort to revive the rawtoaces project, to be discussed at next meeting. | . | Next meeting: 2 December 2020 . | Bill Balew: Can we vote to add members to the TAC (Daniel)? John: the TAC can vote to add up to 3 “industry representatives”. So in theory we could nominate Daniel for TAC membership. Larry: it’s probably not in the best interest in the TAC to have heavy contributors to the process get “yanked away” if their companies change their membership. David: “industry representative” mechanism can be used for this purpose. Discussions with Animal Logic as to the implications of this, we are very thankful to the role Animal Logic has played and contributed to ASWF. Daniel wants the TAC to be successful, he intends to continue to contribute. The TAC can invite Daniel as “industry expert”. It is up to the TAC to make this decision. Want to recognize all the great work Dan has done. Bill: does it just take a motion / vote to offer “industry representative” position to Daniel? . | John: can follow up with Daniel to make sure he wants to follow up? Sean: if we only have 1 or 2 meetings, we need to reach out to TAC members. | Larry: can we propose a motion and defer the vote electronically? . | John: will conduct the vote electronically after checking with Daniel. Will also put motion to extend JF’s industry representative seat. | . ",

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | New member welcome . | Mark Visser, Unity Technologies | . | Industry Representation Vote results (John) . | John: Call for remaining votes for Daniel and JF as Industry Representatives | . | TAC chair election process (John) . | John: election is open, email went out to the TAC list on Monday . | Please send a note of interest, short bio, rationale as to why one would be interested in this position. | You can nominate others as well, but please CC them / reach out to them first to avoid putting them in awkward position . | Close of nominations is next monday at midnight PST . | Daniel: keen to answer any questions as to what the role entails, open and available to answer questions in public or private . | Need to get vote finalized before end of year, so not a lot of time left, please move quickly . | Commitment is a minimum of 2-3 hrs per week to deal with formalities of meeting process, follow up with agenda items. There can be more stewarding / process alignment for working groups, can grow quite a bit. At this stage probably doesn’t require the TAC chair to be involved anymore, the WGs are working well autonomously. But when new projects get started up, that’s when more involvement is required. Governing Board meetings are monthly, with some reporting requirements, activities such as Open Source Days. Lots of work done by David Morin (chair of Governing Board) as well as John and Emily (LF), incoming chair will be able to draw on their experience and support. | John: try to do as much of the legwork as possible, tend to lean on TAC chair to “have the pulse of the group” and set the driving direction, can “sit in the background” to drive the TAC meetings (Daniel has done that very well). | . | Project &amp; Technical Community Survey . | Daniel: not a lot of progress due to some health issues. Some effort picked up by John and Emily to get survey published before end of year. | Can we agree on a timeframe to work towards? OpenCue / Brian are very keen on these results, they were originally on early November timeframe. | Emily: want to get it out as quickly as possible. Need to cull down list of questions from OpenVDB, and looking for preferentially multiple choice questions, makes it easier to produce results for one thing. Will start putting this into SurveyMonkey when every project has provided info, and can provide preview of SurveyMonkey format. | Daniel: can we set goal of end of next week? Emily: yes, as long as the projects have provided feedback. Brian: don’t want to run into holidays at end of year. Daniel: will have a bit of time to help with this. | . | New CLAs (2020 v2.1) . | PR . | John: based on feedback (predominantly from Disney), landed on some tweaks to original CLA documents. Some concerns about being tied to a specific tool. Incorporated some of the language, changes are in the GitHub repo (see PR link). Aim for projects to aim for these revised CLAs. Anyone who had concerns around CLA has approved these new CLAs, so projects should be safe to move to those if they want. | Each project is able to pick the CLA they want, the decision is up to the TSC, LF is happy to provide feedback / answer questions, and help with transition from previous CLAs. This should have unblocked OSL and OTIO transition to official GitHub ASWF organization. | Larry: any project that wants contributions from the Disney companies will want to do this? John: largest feedback on previous CLA was from Disney, and this version addresses these concerns. | Larry: PR was posted into “ramp up” to Thanksgiving, so still making its way through Sony legal. The diffs are useful to get legal departments who had approved the previous version. | Joshua: putting new CLA through Disney approval process, should hopefully all be fine. | Daniel: will work with the TSCs to move towards the new CLAs so that all projects use the same CLAs (if that makes sense). | New branding for the EasyCLA tools, projects don’t have to use the tool, can submit “designated employees” manually if needed . | . | New project proposal (Kimball) . | Proposal (google doc) . | Kimball: 4 years ago raw2aces project was started under AMPAS, WETA has similar tool which processes 400K images per year. Idea is to revive raw2aces project, and merge the WETA technology. A bit strange of a proposal since 2 subprojects, one is a database of spectral sensitivity measurements, spectral light measurements in the future. One project is a dataset, one project is the code that provides the reference implementation, batch capable high speed converter for DSLR images to EXR / ACES. | Larry: only had a chance to skim the document, are you proposing only a batch tool, or could it be a library that could replace dcraw completely? . | Kimball: there will definitely be a library, would like to have a plugin system to accept contributions from camera manufacturers (ARRI, Sony…), so we can support motion picture cameras as well. But no plans to have a UI, don’t want to make a viewer. | Daniel: is the project a fork or a move of the AMPAS project? Kimball: existing one is relatively minimal, lots of community interest to have such a tool. So a “move + massive upgrade”. Alex: backstory is that there’s a lot of interest in using DSLRs with ACES, converting raw files to ACES container files, requires creation of an IDT. Based on libraw, a bit of a skunkworks project. Realized there was duplication of effort between AMPAS and WETA, better to build a “bigger / better” version that would serve the needs of the VFX community. | Eric: who owns libraw? How does it relate to dcraw? Kimball: libraw is a GPL library, not clear who owns / drives it. Alex: there was an intent by the developer of libraw to create a more maintainable version of dcraw (“a big chunk of C code”), so libraw was trying to reproduce the functionality of dcraw in a more maintainable way. | Larry: libraw is widely used, OIIO uses it, so studios using OIIO to convert raw files are using libraw under the covers. But it is not easy to interface with, an ASWF project would be welcome. | Larry: what would be the merits of a completely separate project, when it has a foot in ACES, OCIO, EXR worlds… Should it live under one of these projects? Or does it deserve its own TSC as a full ASWF project? . | Kimball: the issue of having the database of reference data may justify having its own project? . | Daniel: if there’s a particular set of expertise that borders on the commercial / proprietary that could encourage camera manufacturers to contribute, that could be useful. Larry: was primary concerned that there may be exact overlap of potential TSC members, but it can be justified if there are separate interests. | Daniel: logistically, does the project proposal constitute an adoption of the existing AMPAS raw2aces project (transfer of repo, IP), or is it a new, from scratch project? Kimball: there will be a transfer of info, especially the existing spectral measurement tables. Not clear how much of the code would be reusable. | Alex: don’t have a large development staff at AMPAS, the main developer on raw2aces has moved on to a different position. | JF: would be useful to figure out where the project lives in the “stack” to avoid circular dependencies between ASWF projects? Kimball: don’t think the project will need to depend on OCIO, but will depend on OpenEXR, and OIIO would likely use it. So would be “somewhere in the middle” of the stack. | Larry: how large is the code base? Would it be better to just implement it in OIIO as a reader? Kimball: would be larger than a typical library in a plugin folder in OIIO. Will need to produce IDTs for the different cameras. | Daniel: let’s treat this as a project from the governance / contribution way, we can explore other mechanisms such as submoduling if that makes sense from a technical point of view. We typically have a first proposal for a new project, we take at least a week to digest, formulate questions, and move for a vote at the next meeting. One more meeting until end of the year, should probably move discussion to mailing list to address any other specific questions, and plan to have a vote at the next call. | From the chat: . | From Deke Kincaid to Everyone: (1:28 PM) Out of curiosity, why not simply wrap openimageio and improve its raw support if needed? . | From Henry Vera (DNEG) to Everyone: (1:33 PM) . | I agree with Daniel, that if it encourages more involvement from the camera manufacturers that would be great! . | From Larry Gritz to Everyone: (1:35 PM) . | I’m very enthusiastic about the existence of this project, I would love to replace OIIO’s current use of libraw with this in order to (presumably) improve RAW support. | From Henry Vera (DNEG) to Everyone: (1:36 PM) . | We have some people working in a very similar vein, it would be great to get them more exposure if there are some questions about exactly how to position it. I’m presuming there are other’s with similar experience and tech. Should we arrange a specific call to dive more deeply? . | From Deke Kincaid to Everyone: (1:36 PM) . | My biggest worry is film cameras seem to be on our side for vfx but their photographic wings seem to be heavy on the proprietary and encrypting data in the raw formatsWhich is why libraw is a lot of reverse engineering of raw formats . | From Henry Vera (DNEG) to Everyone: (1:36 PM) . | Deke: I agree with your concern. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | OpenCue: hoping to have user survey data to have graduation proposal . | Larry: Imageworks has finally switched all productions to OpenCue from the internal predecessor system, OpenCue has successfully replaced the internal system and does everything. Largest challenge was switching the database, but that is now done. | . | Working Groups . | CI . | We’ve been skirting around the important issue of package management. So far we’ve used Docker, but within the scope of the ASWF, we want to look at the problem of package management, making software available in a more fine grained, dynamic way that the studios require. | Next week’s meeting: Ryan Botriell (SPI) presenting SPK dynamic environment package management system. Want feedback on the approach they have been taking, had opportunity to look at the work and it looks very interesting. Encourage anyone interested in this topic to attend next CI meeting. | AWS announcement of Intel Mac Minis, availability of M1 Mac Minis in January from AWS and MacStadium. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Emily: webinars will start in mid February 2021 after students back from break. | Working on blog post around inclusive terminology, looking for ASWF project examples. Looking for tips / easy first steps that companies can make. Would help to provide context. | . | Python 3 . | No Python3 WG meeting since last call | . | USD . | Meeting last week, first presentation on the agenda: USD example plugin repository, walks people through how to structure a USD plugin. Some interested parties may be contributing soon. Helps to get people up and running quickly. | Discussed possibilities for an open source camera rig in USD, follow up next week. | Looking for additional topics of relevance to the group, if you think of anything, please reach out via Slack or email . | Daniel: nice to see tangible progress / outcomes . | . | Review &amp; Approval . | Interesting presentation-oriented meeting to that group on Tuesday. Larry: group is in a phase of getting presentations from a variety of in-house and commercial products in that space. Looking to take inventory of what people have done, what the needs are. Yesterday were Imageworks with itview and frame.io, were supposed to be 10 minutes each, both became quite longer + substantial Q&amp;A, valuable discussion. Sean Looper: Is itview on the tablet for open source? Larry: not yet, just showing off what the different groups think is important in a media and review tool, we’ll see where things lead. | Will there be further contributions? Larry: meeting was supposed to make it through 5-6 systems, only made it through 2. Still trying to get a handle of what we want to come out of the WG, so still in exploratory phase. JT: Wiki page is coming along nicely. Daniel: nice to see the Wiki format working well for the WGs. | Joshua: a topic that came up in review and approval group and OTIO: how do annotations work, how to do annotations in USD (attaching notes to objects in space), topic will continue to come up. What’s a good way to organize discussion around annotations in the broader sense. | . | Asset Repository . | Wave: trying to “find our way”, had the most contributions from people in latest meeting, one of the things that came out is that the project could be about giving the “CLA equivalent” for donating an asset. Is it for publication / research? Is it “creative commons 0” and can be used, is it for education only? Personally not interested in legal (I am not a lawyer), but it is important. Leverage the Creative Commons effort. Previous discussions about a reference render of 3D assets, the Moana asset from Disney could be re-exported as USD, is being able to render with Renderman sufficient? If people want to bring up topics, please bring those up on the Slack channel. JT reached out to an archive at a University. Is it an archive? A digital backlot? Still trying to figure out. | John: can help with the legal definitions, how a CLA fits in. Because of the nature of this, may want to take this to the legal committee, which will likely have some feedback. | Wave: would be good to have clarity for the people considering contributions, before you can donate something from a large organization, will need to know under what terms. John: trying to avoid a multitude of licenses. Wave: what’s the ASWF’s opinion on an asset repository? Feel free to discuss this on the Slack channel. | . | We should encourage the Rust people to join the call, is there something obvious the TAC can do to help this effort along. Sean Looper: can we pick a TAC sponsor to act as an informal proxy for those conversations? Would be useful to get a summary of progress, even if there isn’t a “formal” WG. Daniel: a WG could be easy, makes it discoverable, will reach out to some of the people in that space and see if they are interested, would someone be interested in leading a WG effort. Sean: having regular visibility would help. | . | Update on candidate projects . | Next meeting: December 16 . | . ",

    "content": "ASWF CI Goals for Year 2 . | GPU Build &amp; Test (success!) . | Mac, Windows &amp; Linux (New focus) . | Packaging / Distribution . | Testing with commercial components . | CI WG is concerned with configuration and setup of the ASWF CI infrastructure and supporting systems such as the Docker (aswf-docker) containers, as well as any other dependencies. Initial focus was to get Linux / VFX Reference platform up and running in an easy to use and stable way. Extended to GPU-based build and test (using AWS CodeBuild), driven by requirements from OCIO. Next steps are extending platform support to macOS and Windows, currently mostly working on macOS. Also looking at packaging and distribution to provide dependencies for our projects (Docker not as well supported on other OSes), and want to make our projects easily consumable in studios. | This session will be recorded for those who couldn’t attend.

The goals described seem to be wholly served by Nix, how is this different from Nix, and what comparisons would you draw. Ryan: no layered file system, very distributed like Rez, not easy to figure out how it resolves. Also looking for a packaging format that works better for VFX developers. The package format in Nix is challenging. But yes, there is a lot of crossover, and including with every other package manager. But every other package manager comes with caveats in VFX facility environments. Nix only supports a single package hierarchy, doesn’t support having multiple versions of a package active at the same time? Need to create “intrusive” build scripts in Nix. No system is a panacea, but systems tend to be as useful as they have momentum behind them, the first evaluation is the set of dependencies you need to support it. Does it already have the “hard things” incorporated (like TensorFlow). What is the likelihood of a new package manager gaining momentum compared to existing solutions. | Daniel: VFX/Animation industry has specific requirements for supporting large binary commercial applications, places a set of constraints that are typically not supported by many packaging solutions. Needing to pin to specific Maya versions, need to support multiple sets of dependencies in parallel. That’s the crucial differentiating problem that may justify an industry specific solution. | Is there a centralized component to “path resolution”? Current iteration localizes files, so all client side, same as cloning a git repository. Regardless of running off NFS or local, benefit of a single filesystem library is that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is always a single entry: /spfs/lib and deferring to overlayfs for client side resolution of which file to actually look up. No centralized component. | Mark: ILM developing a similar system to SPK, have been working on a document to describe the differences, some fundamental differences (level of isolation from the host system, ILM feels that complete isolation from the host system is a desirable goal to provide fully reproducible build artifacts) . | Federico: have we looked at the containerization system singularity, container runtime that blurs the line between what you have in on the host and in the container. Doesn’t require root, used in the HPC space, so definitely appropriate to HPC. Seems to have a lot of momentum. | Is SpFS Linux Specific? Larry: yes, so more eyes on it / different expertise may allow extension to other platforms (Windows, macOS), looking for ideas to extend to other platforms. | If you have an artist jumping between shows, do you have to pre-setup the machine? Ryan: trying to prove the workflow initially, once the environment is resolved, can identify every file you need, can be copied on demand from NFS, web repository… Trying to reduce the load time for an application, don’t need to localize all the time in the future. | Do you cache tools? Ryan: it depends what you are loading and from where. “Sometimes” . | Larry: use Avere for caching, but depends where things are mounted from and what server they are on. | Ryan: wanted to prove the workflow of localizing things first and running it there first. Trying to make the software more reliable in the fact of “networking slowness”, or not have access to the main NFS repository. Did you see large gains with localization? Yes, but not sure yet if it’s fully worth it. But want to support both scenarios, have long had a need to isolate from NFS. | Daniel: obviously lots of interest, great presentation. Demonstrating how this system is different from what else is available. Will require deeper discussions, how should we follow up the discussion. Larry: this is likely the correct forum, in these meetings, the #wg-ci channel in Slack or the TAC mailing list. Would like to see some interest from other facilities, demonstrate that ASWF can be a forum to help the developer experience at every company. Would like to see a similar effort from the community similar to what happened to the CI infrastructure. “Chicken and egg problem”. SPI is prepared to open source if the community is prepared to help / demonstrate that evidence, it needs to be a community effort. Also want the feature requests / feedback / contributions of different area of expertise, but not only that, want it to be a real community project. This is being deployed at SPI, but early enough in project that it can still be influenced in major ways, so this is the right stage to reach out to the community. Lots of room to steer it, now is the right time to do this. | Christopher: how difficult would be to try out in an example environment? How long would it take to get up and running? Aloys: could we be able to use this for the small number of packages for the ASWF docker effort, could be a good test environment. For the ASWF docker containers, should be “as simple” as changing /usr/local/ to /spfs, but doesn’t help with macOS / Windows support, so will still require a lot of work by Mac / Windows experts. But interested in applying it to the ASWF Docker effort. | Ryan: there is a path where SPI can provide a couple of RPM packages that can be installed and try the current version, and a ZIP file with some documentation. Larry: having many people have their hands on it would help with authoring the YAML package descriptions. A limitation of other packages with 10K recipes are not the specific packages for a typical VFX environment, but recipes developed by our industry members would be useful, since we all pretty much depend on the same packages. Would need to build that infrastructure of packages from the ground up. | Daniel: various channels identified with the CI WG are the right place to have follow up discussion, we are going into Holiday session, next meeting of CI WG will be a good place to continue the discussion. | . | . | CentOS transition to Stream model . | Skipped due to lack of time | . | .

    "content": ". | Goals for TAC: Year 2 . | Good success on the CI front, more work to do on the TAC side . | Lots of activity in the WGs . | Progress on the D&amp;I front . | . | Governing Board Update (David) . | Last Governing Board meeting yesterday, where we review the goals for the year ahead (2021), get alignment for our goals . | Alignment with Calendar Year (2021), including memberships . | Timeline of ASWF history. 2 main phases: original goal of 6 projects in the first year (took a bit longer), reached $1M financing. Phase 2 was FY2020, got disrupted by COVID-19, spent most of phase 2 dealing that in various ways. Extending memberships for certain members hit hard by the situation. TAC continued working on projects and delivering on the mission. Current events highlighted need for D&amp;I efforts. | Entering phase 3: . | Funding . | Projects . | Outreach . | . | Funding: started year at $1M run rate, but at time of renewal, Animal Logic downgrade to General Member, Blue Sky and Cisco cancellations. Back down to just below $1M. | COVID set us back a year in our growth plan, resuming goal of $1.3M by end of 2021. Target approved by the board. | 2021 member company targets: 10 companies targeted as potential premier members, 30 companies targeted as general members. More focus on getting companies to join as general members. | Develop Value Proposition for general members based on the experience and feedback of our existing general members: . | Why join . | Specifics on benefits: how does this work, testimonials . | Cost structure . | Membership application . | Jordan Soles from Rodeo working on this . | . | Use this to seek general membership from smaller animation / vfx companies, also software / hardware vendors that might want to join . | 2 events: ASWF Forum in March, Open Source Days in August . | Working with the TAC, aim to bring 3 new projects in the foundation in FY 2021, we have a harmonious set of projects, but don’t want to stick with the status quo (3 new projects showed on the timeline) . | Looking at potential new projects: ACES, Meshroom, Rez, USD… (not an exhaustive list) . | Develop value proposition for potential projects: . | Specifics on benefits . | Why transfer your project . | How would this work . | How to get alignment internally . | How to deal with typical pushback . | Help to fill the proposal template . | . | Invest in D&amp;I for the long term, and promote software engineers in our industry . | Q: how are the funding targets assessed? Initial $1M was an “ambitious goal” what we managed to reach, new target of $1.3M is a reasonable target we can achieve, underlying goal is to ensure the foundation is well funded, fund our current activities, and funding for new initiatives. There are lots of committees that put together projects and initiatives but have no money to work with, so they aren’t as effective as they would want to be. A chief goal of creating the ASWF was to have the capabilities to reach our goals. Get to a level which gives us a solid base that we can act on and take action. Michael Min: is there an assessment of what these funds would be used for? A: put the money at the feet of the TAC, the “heart” of the foundation. Some funds are there to cover our operations (for instance services from LF), surplus is there for projects such as D&amp;I (budget was provided for activities). Also any projects require funds (for instance for-pay services for CI infrastructure). The funds are there for the TAC. Michael: we need to tell potential members what the funds would be used for. Daniel: we’ve also looked at grants, or our own equivalent of GSoC. | Q: we aren’t significantly spending our existing funds, so why are we growing the fiscal target? David: the ASWF wants to grow the software engineering capabilities and projects common across the industry, want to create a strong platform across the industry, which exists in other industries where open source is playing a major role in developing platforms. We have the potential to do this in our industry: funds are needed for this, but mostly talent. Growing and supporting the TAC, giving the tools to grow the platform, need to have enough money to do so. Push to increase available funds, want to make sure we have all the funds to support any initiatives that come in the future. Want to be funded in the open source world, bringing in new members is how we grow this. Henry: not sure that having more money is the goal to have, we should identify strategic goals, and figure out how much money we need to achieve those goals. We haven’t clearly established yet what we’re using the funds. We need to be clear about what we’re trying to establish. David: the mission of ASWF is well understood, grow the use of OSS in the industry. The presentation to the board implied that context. Approval of projects comes from the TAC, the board is there to support the TAC. Henry: still not very clear. David: it’s up to the TAC to decide. For instance if we wanted to bring USD / ACES / … into the ASWF, and looking at the amount of work, may need to bring in for pay work for instance? . | Larry: we had good success with GSoC, 3 projects who got students got a lot of value out of it, so we may want to fund our expansion of these types of projects. But yes, no one has ever told the TAC “here’s how much money you have to spend”? Would want to see concrete examples of budget items. Michael Min: could make sense to go through a capex cycle for each project to figure out what the monetary needs could be. Agree with Henry, would help to have clarity. Would want to be part of the conversation, and know what we should be budgeting for. David: these are good points, we need to get there, but should know that the money is being gather for TAC and project activities, and that there are funds available for projects (primary) and WGs (secondary, although D&amp;I is a priority). How much money? David to provide as an action item. If there is something that costs money and would be good to do, it is possible. | Henry: what is the value of the foundation to premiere members vs general members? Would it make more money to focus on making the entry point for members lower to keep more premier members, would this not have more value to the foundation overall. It’s a stretch for some companies to keep their premier level. David: the value for premier members is pretty clear: a seat on the Governing Board. We did lose some premier members in this COVID year, but we didn’t too poorly (AMD, Unity), there’s been a lot of expectation of general members would be part of a network of companies. We haven’t delivered that for them, some of the companies have voiced their dissatisfaction with that. Would rather move the value for general members up, especially for smaller / medium sized studios. It’s important to diversify our membership, go beyond the smaller number of large studios we currently have, so this is why we’re focussing on general membership. | Henry: What is the value to the Foundation of the premier vs general membership? David: it’s always evolving, we’ve set the rules and the levels of engagement, not sure we could have lowered the premier commitment level to keep AL at premier level, they are at the general level and have a mechanism to keep valuable commitments (Daniel). We are in good shape in terms of our structure, would be a huge effort to revise membership rules and membership regulations. There was also some reservations as to the current makeup of ASWF projects. There will be downgrades and upgrades over time as to where companies stand wrt ASWF. Questions are very valid, can continue discussion, either in TAC forum or one on one. We are a young organization, and we can adapt over time. | . | TAC chair election (John) . | Opened nominations for TAC chair, but haven’t received any nominations. So looking for someone interested in taking on this role, either for the full year basis, or on a temporary role that could be re-evaluated during the year. Chair role can seem daunting, and it is not uncommon to have trouble filling this role. Chair role is important, both organization TAC activities and interfacing with the board. LF tries to keep the time commitment to a minimum, but crucial role nonetheless. | Robin: willing to help. John: TAC chairperson role is require to be a voting member of the TAC, so needs to be a premier member or project representative. | Daniel: it has been a very rewarding activity. Commitment depends on the level of activity, generally speaking it has trended down as projects and WGs have been self managing. Currently about 5 hours a week commitment. | Kimball: nominate Larry? Larry: nominate Kimball? Larry: currently running 2 widely used open source projects, so not sure has enough bandwidth, this is a big year for OSL, getting GPU support going. Might be interested in another year. But would support Kimball. Daniel: second Kimball. | John: governing board representation has to be a single person, but for the TAC, could have a co-chair, but one of these would be the representation to the board (could swap back and forth). | Does TAC chair count against FTE commitment of a premier member? David: will soon start to keep track of FTE requirement, in first couple of years there was no strict tracking, but will start looking more closely. TAC chair not currently considered, but could be. David looks for a partner in the TAC chair, discussions on developing the strategy, there has to be a dialog between TAC and Governing Board. Role is collaborative. | Do we need to formalize this with an endorsement vote? Yes, we have quorum. | Daniel: nominate Kimball. Larry seconds. Any opposes or abstains? No, unanimous. Congratulations and thanks to Kimball! . | . | Project proposal and discussion: rawtoaces (Kimball) . | Bring raw2aces under the ASWF, revival a tool that people are continuing to ask for, don’t want to duplicate effort at WETA. Path towards what to do with ACES, software + data warehouse of camera spectral sensitivity characterization. How to host ACES test images. | Effort on how to store lens / camera metadata in OTIO, so collaboration. | Kimball: some other data would make sense to store in there. | We had set a couple of weeks to think of questions, why should we do or not do this. Should we move this to the first meeting of next year? . | Henry: very interested at doing this at DNeg . | Where else could this happen: Kimball: could happen on the WETA GitHub . | Daniel: it looks like a strong project proposal. Safe harbor for contribution of data that is otherwise proprietary / sensitive / hard to share, and good place to collaborate with ACES. | Larry: if this project existed, it would be of great use to the members of ASWF . | Larry: move to adopt. (seconded). Daniel: call for vote for adoption of raw2aces as an incubation stage project. No against, no abstain. Adopted! Raw2aces will be an incubation stage ASWF project. | . | ASWF Project and Community Survey (John / Emily) . | Emily: putting into Survey Monkey, should have draft by EOD / early tomorrow for review. There are a few sections that could still use drop-down selections, OpenVDB still need to be pared down (Ken to look at it). | Daniel: want to make sure this doesn’t get buried in the holidays, should be in a form ready to release this week, can then decide when to push it out. Any guidance as to when we should release it? Emily: it can be tricky with the holidays, we don’t necessarily want to wait for the new year, but may want to keep submissions open until end of January so we can do a second push after the holidays. Daniel: we can keep the window open. | . | Follow up: Rust working group? (Daniel) . | Reached out to Rust Slack channel on the creation of a WG (today), some positive support. Should be possible to find the right person to set bridges (Nick attending this call). | . | Working Groups . | CI . | Sony Package Manager SPK presentation: recording . | Larry: SPI is looking if there is enough interest from a user and co-developer perspective to turn it into a ASWF project. If there is demand, will try to push for it. | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Carol: 2 things coming up, webinar series, partnership between ASWF D&amp;I and universities, aimed at college age students, introduction to open source, the industry and careers. Information in Slack channel and calendars. Also will start contacting project chairs for the D&amp;I Ambassador program for project, with a connection back into the D&amp;I WG. | Presented a proposed budget to the board based on planned activities. Difference between internship vs mentorship. | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: working on creating a transition guide based on the WDA transition guide, making sure it is applicable globally across studios large and small. Also work coming in from SideFX around C++ bindings, documentation and guidelines around transitioning to Python 3 when working in raw C. | . | USD . | Still pursuing use case examples from industry partners . | Looking at a standard camera rig schema that could be transported between platforms, game engines. Not the same as the implied camera on the USD stage, would be a functional camera. Wave has a working example. | Interest as using USD as an asset standard, the camera as a “character”. | Daniel: using schema mechanism, but making choices as to how to encode things? Michael Min: yes, using variants scheme, want to avoid having to reinvent the wheel in each DCC, avoiding having to remap all the operations on the camera rig. | . | Review &amp; Approval . | Larry: attended meeting 2 weeks ago, 2 in depth demos of representative demos, 2 more this week. When we resume in January, there will be more demos. Trying to define problem domain, a deliverable has not been decided on yet. | . | Asset Repository . | Looking to server the needs of projects first, OpenEXR is the candidate project that already has a data set but seeks to extend / modernize it. Eric: is it for at-scale testing of our existing projects, and other vendors/open source projects, or other purposes? Some discussion about this on the Slack channel. Will discuss further when Wave is back at next meeting. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | Update on candidate projects . | Dependency/version guidance beyond VFX Platform? . | Next meeting: December 30, 2020 . | .

    "content": "The Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) is collaboration between the Linux Foundation and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, serving as an umbrella organization that is the home to several key open source software projects used by the film industry (primarily visual effects and animation production). The projects we manage are some of the most high-profile and widely used open source projects originating and used in film production studios. It’s a great opportunity for students to get involved with projects that will be used professionally on films! . The mission of the ASWF is to increase the quality and quantity of contributions to the content creation industry’s open source software base; to provide a neutral forum to coordinate cross-project efforts; to provide a common build and test infrastructure; and to provide individuals and organizations a clear path to participation in advancing our open source ecosystem. Member projects are focused primarily on visual effects and animation production, and at present include 5 distinct software packages. Student summer project applications can be for any of these packages individually, as well as potentially including tasks that bridge between them or provide common infrastructure (they share CI and other resources). The current member projects are: . | OpenColorIO : A complete color management solution geared towards motion picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation. | OpenCue : A render management / job queueing system you can deploy for visual effects and animation productions. | OpenEXR : The specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, the professional-grade image storage format of the motion picture industry. | Open Shading Language : The de facto standard shading and pattern language of physically-based renderers used for film VFX and animation. | OpenTimelineIO : API and interchange format for editorial timeline information. | OpenVDB : Hierarchical data structure and a suite of tools for the efficient storage and manipulation of sparse volumetric data. | .

The individual projects are listed below with their home pages, GitHub repositories, and a list of possible projects. You may choose a summer task from any of our software projects. It is also permissible to propose (a) a task that is common infrastructure shared by the projects, such as with our CI system; (b) a task that crosses project boundaries or involves two projects; (c) a task that is technically in a non-ASWF code base but for which our organization is an appropriate mentor (as an illustrative example: adding comprehensive OpenColorIO support to a widely used open source project). All of our projects maintain their own CONTRIBUTING guidelines, please read them for the project you are interested in. They each also have separate contributor license agreements (CLAs) which must be signed for them to accept contributions. Successfully submitting a Pull Request to the ASWF software project you are applying to is a strict requirement prior to submitting an application. This is not negotiable. We will not even read applications from students who have not submitted an acceptable PR to the project they are applying to participate in. It can be a truly minimal change – for example, fixing a typo in an error message. The purpose of this requirement is to prove that you already have the skills to set up a GitHub login, successfully clone the project, build it, make a change, submit a PR, and interact with the community for code review. In addition to ideas listed below, the GitHub “Issues” page for each project will have issues tagged “GSoC” if they seem like an appropriate size for a GSoC summer project.

Home page: https://opencolorio.org/ GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: C++11, CMake, color science . Mentor suggestions: Patrick Hodoul, Doug Walker, Michael Dolan . Project Ideas: . | Add Metal, Vulkan, or CUDA language support to GPU renderer . | The OCIO Processor currently supports rendering color transforms on a GPU with GLSL (OpenGL), HLSL (DirectX), or CG. With Apple deprecating OpenGL support and the availability of several additional high-performance GPU computing platforms, we desire to add shader language support for one or more of these to expand the capability and reach of OCIO. This will also be a critical need for OCIO to maintain full cross-platform support. | Special skills: Familiar with C++, shader development, and implementing graphics APIs. | . | Restore Java bindings . | The OCIO Java language bindings have not yet been updated to support the newly developed OCIO v2 API. Java provides additional Android platform support, but needs some effort to revive. Additionally, adding Java unit test support to OCIO’s CI infrastructure would help maintain the functionality as OCIO continues to evolve. | Special skills: Comfortable with Java, with some knowledge of wrapping a C++ library with the JNI. | . | Add OCIO support to FFmpeg or another FOSS project . | An important effort for OCIO is expanding the libraries and applications where OCIO is implemented. Users have specifically called out FFmpeg as a library and command-line tool where they would like to see OCIO support, but any other FOSS project leveraged by digital artists or production pipelines could be considered. This could also include upgrading an existing implementation to support the OCIO v2 API and leverage new functionality. | Special skills: Familiarity with prospective host library or tool, and knowledge of working with image buffers and authoring plugins. | . | Develop GUI for interactive OCIO config authoring and visualization . | OCIO is all about color management, but the visual results of a config author’s decisions are not verifiable until the config is generated and loaded into a host application. Learning and using OCIO could be greatky aided with a GUI which provides interactive visual feedback and validation while a config is being authored. This could be a standalone Qt or PySide application, or an expanded plugin within an existing graphics application like Foundry’s Nuke. | Special skills: Experience with GUI and graphics programming in C++ or Python, understanding of UX, and interest in data visualization. | . | . OpenCue . Home page: https://www.opencue.io GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: Python, Java . Mentor suggestion: Brian Cipriano . Getting Started: . Contact Brian Cipriano «cipriano@google.com» and join the opencue-dev list. Project Ideas: . | Create a Web GUI . | Design and begin implementation on a new, web-based GUI to eventually replace OpenCue’s existing PySide2 application GUI. This will consist mostly of front-end work; the new GUI should use the existing OpenCue API on the back-end. Design, including tech stack to be used, will be done in collaboration with the project leads. | Special skills: UI/UX design, front-end development | . | Create a REST API . | Create a REST API to complement OpenCue’s existing gRPC API. Backend should be mostly shared between the two. | Special skills: REST API design | . | Create a Cloud Management Plugin . | Extend the OpenCue GUI to add a plugin for scaling the pool of OpenCue workers running in the cloud. The plugin should use at least one of the major cloud providers (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or Amazon Web Services) but should be designed in way where other cloud providers can be easily added. | Special skills: Cloud development and APIs | . | Create Installers/Launchers . | Create installers (.exe, .msi, .dmg, etc.) and/or click-to-launch wrappers for existing OpenCue components. To goal is to make OpenCue more user friendly by reducing reliance on the command line and providing an intuitive click-to-install/-launch experience. | Special skills: Desktop application development | . | . OpenEXR . Home page: https://www.openexr.com/ GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: . Mentor suggestions: Kimball Thurston, Cary Phillips, Larry Gritz, Nick Porcino . Project Ideas: . | New python bindings for Imath using pybind11. | Our core C++ library for vector and matrix types, which is widely used by other projects, needs an overhaul of its Python bindings to switch to using pybind11 | . | Split Imath into a separate project and modernize . | The main library is for dealing with OpenEXR image files. But several helper libraries are bundled, including a widely used vector, matrix, and math library known as Imath. We would like to split this off into a separate repository (which will then be a dependency of the image file library). There are several possible sub-tasks: . | actually splitting the library into separate repo and adjusting all the CMake build scripts | make almost all of it exception-free and marked properly as noexcept | mark const and constexpr as widely as possible. | . | . | Explore and benchmark compression methods . | Design a methodology for assessing compression and decompression speed and file sizes. | Benchmark the currently supported set of compression techniques across a variety of represenative images and document the performance and compression ratio tradeoffs among the choices. | Speculatively implement additional compression techniques such as zfp or zstd (and possibly others) to find out if they offer advantages over our current set of compression methods. | . | Performance evaluation and regression detection . | We currently have a test suite to verify correctness, but not performance. | Design and implement performance tests as part of our testing framework. This should probably cover a variety of image file scenarios and settings. | Extend our build and CI system to automatically detect performance regressions or improvements for submitted code changes and proposed releases. | . | Expand “Simple” API . | Update the IlmImfRGBAFile interface | Expose a pure “C” interface to the DSO | Write a sample python binding using this C api | . | Amend test suite to get closer to 100% coverage . | Current tests cover about 75% of the C++ code base, as reported by SonarCloud. | Implement tests that validate the behavior of the uncovered components. | . | . OpenTimelineIO . Home page: http://opentimeline.io GitHub: https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenTimelineIO Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: C++, Python, CMake, knowledge of how NLEs and DCCs are used, knowledge of EDLs a bonus . Mentor suggestions: Josh Minor, Stephan Steinbach, Nick Porcino, Eric Reinecke . Project Ideas: . | Progress Callback API . | Some import and export operations are time consuming, and tool authors would like to provide progress estimations. A progress callback, presumably with a percentage or other measure would enable this. | OTIO file format adaptors are written in Python, so this would be a Python-available API | . | Javascript Language binding . | Use emscripten’s WebIDL or Embind to provide Javascript bindings for OpenTimelineio | An open question is whether the adaptors, such as for AAF, would be available under Javascript. The adaptors are implemented in Python. | . | Otioview as a web app . | Otioview track and timeline metadata viewing . | Add metadata introspection and navigation on timelines and tracks | . | C Language binding . | A C foreign function interface (ffi) would enable bindings for languages other than Js and Python. | Example applications would be Lua bindings, and remote procedure calls. | . | Reusable timeline display widgets . | Otioview has a widget for Qt. Having the widget separately available for other apps would be great | An ImGui variant | A generic widget assuming only the availability of mouse interaction data and simple draw calls | . | C++ and Python operators for time ranges . | Functions such as “meets”, “overlaps”, and so on. | . | C++ and Python time coordinate system class . | Coordinate system implementation and operators to enable operations such as local to parent, world to local, and so on. | . | opentime_clock for std::chrono . | bindings to allow meaningful interoperation with std templates that have time arguments | . | Add OTIO to another ASWF project . | Identify another ASWF project that might meaningfully interoperate with OTIO and implement it | . | Add OTIO support to an NLE or DCC . | As an example, the generic widget project could be used to build OTIO support into Blender | An OTIO adapter could support time based media, such as Grease Pencil storyboards in Blender | . | . OpenVDB . Home page: https://www.openvdb.org/ GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: C++14, Git, CMake, (Knowledge of Houdini is also useful) . Mentor suggestions: Ken Museth, Dan Bailey, Nick Avramoussis . Project Ideas: . | Delayed Loading on Windows . | Introduce support for delayed-loading on Windows by modifying the temporary file implementation in the core OpenVDB library to make use of the Windows- specific std::fopen flags for temporary files (“TD”). | Help to improve the Windows-related build, CI and documentation. | Background Info: OpenVDB can generate very large files and even with the fastest solid state drives, I/O performance is still a common bottleneck. Delayed-loading (sometimes referred to as lazy-loading) is about reading only the VDB data that is absolutely needed. An example use case is being able to clip or delete voxel data from the VDB before the data has been read from disk resulting in an overall increase in performance when visualizing data. | . | Improved Level Set Rebuilding . | Modify the rebuilding of VDB level sets to improve the flood-filling operation that can eliminate desirable features. | Background Info: Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) operations include union, difference and intersection compositing of two or more level sets that will result in a new level set. An example could be subtracting some level set spheres from a level set of a cube to generate a “Swiss cheese” level set. If the narrow band or transform of the source level sets does not match the target level set, they must be completely rebuilt before they can be composited which can result in eliminating desirable features of the source level set. In particular, the rebuilding algorithm converts to polygons and back, which will cause holes in the geometry to be filled. The Polygon -&gt; VDB rasterization could be special cased to use the original VDB to determine sign, thus avoiding collapsing holes. | . | Multi-thread Sequential Algorithms . | Introduce new multi-threaded algorithms that use leaf and tile traversal to replicate existing single-threaded tree algorithms (such as tree::activeVoxelCount). | Introduce new extrema and statistics tools (such as tools::extrema) that are multi-threaded using leaf and tile traversal. | Background info: Investigations carried out using the existing sequential tree-based algorithms in OpenVDB have demonstrated a large performance improvement by multi-threading across different levels of the tree data structure. In addition, OpenVDB provides general purpose leaf and tile traversal for computing extrema and statistics, however the most intuitive way to use these is by calling them with a tree iterator which is very slow. Both of these performance improvements would use Intel’s TBB and OpenVDB convenience classes such as tree::LeafManager and tree::NodeManager to introduce multi-threading. | . | Improve Filter Operations to Densify Tiles and Optionally Dilate . | Automatically densify specific VDB tiles required to perform different filtering operations such as gaussian smoothing and handle all edge cases. | Provide an option to automatically dilate level set VDBs as required when filtering based on filter and voxel sizes. | Background info: OpenVDB tiles are constant-value nodes designed to optimize storage space and improve performance. However not all algorithms, such as gaussian smoothing turn these tiles into dense nodes (often called densifying) when required so as to generate the correct result. In addition, it is left up to the user to specify the correct amount of dilation to perform prior to any filtering based on their filter size and the voxel size. A beneficial feature would be allowing the user to opt-in to dilate automatically up to some threshold. | . | Optimization using SSE/AVX Intrinsics . | Investigate opportunities to improve VDB performance using vectorization and SSE and AVX intrinsics. | Background info: OpenVDB already has optional SSE/AVX build flags, but minimal use of any of these intrinsics. There are lots of potential operations such as bit-counting, finding least significant bit, SSE/AVX operation on floating-point values (e.g. math::Vec3) and integer operations (e.g. math::Coord) that would benefit performance. | . | . Cross-project infrastructure . ASWF-Docker . GitHub: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-docker Skills/knowledge relevant to the project: Python, Docker, Bash, CMake . Mentor suggestions: Aloys Baillet, JF Panisset . Project Ideas: . | Better docker image discovery via automatic readme uploads to DockerHub overviews on image push (modern Python 3 development, dockerhub rest API). These readme files would populate the “overview” tab on the docker hub pages such as this one: https://hub.docker.com/r/aswf/ci-openexr. | Investigate RPM (yum packages) generation from docker ci-packages such as https://hub.docker.com/r/aswf/ci-package-openexr. These RPMs would potentially be hosted on an artifactory yum repo which would enable any RHEL or CentOS user to very easily install many VFX packages. | Create a prototype of a windows docker image equivalent to the linux ci-common and ci-base images to be able to compile VFX packages such as OpenEXR. Many details on the windows version of our CI docker images are still yet to be defined and discovered. | . … more ideas go here … . ",

    "content": "ASWF CI Goals for Year 3 . | GPU Build &amp; Test (success!) . | Mac, Windows &amp; Linux (New focus) . | Packaging / Distribution . | Michael: seems like we haven’t touched this a lot, and needs to be a bigger focus. There have been some discussions in OCIO, trying to get a v2 release out this month, follow up will be to support package managers across the board. Definitely on the radar. Currently support in a number of package managers, but unclear how well they are supported. There’s a broken vcpkg package, and it’s part of some Linux distros. Investigating Conan, PyPi (so you can pip install the Python bindings) . | Andrew: LF projects cannot distribute VMs because of “license aggregation” issues. You can distribute build recipes. | Michael: OCIO is included in HomeBrew but supported by users. Ideally would like to have a CD pipeline that can update downstream distributions. | Mark: often we don’t know who are the maintainers on these packages, “The Brew package is broken”, but who maintains that package. | C++con 2019 talk on “making life easier for package managers” . | . | Testing with commercial components . | CI WG is concerned with configuration and setup of the ASWF CI infrastructure and supporting systems such as the Docker (aswf-docker) containers, as well as any other dependencies. Initial focus was to get Linux / VFX Reference platform up and running in an easy to use and stable way. Extended to GPU-based build and test (using AWS CodeBuild), driven by requirements from OCIO. Next steps are extending platform support to macOS and Windows, currently mostly working on macOS. Also looking at packaging and distribution to provide dependencies for our projects (Docker not as well supported on other OSes), and want to make our projects easily consumable in studios. | . New Items . | CentOS transition to Stream model . | Mitch: emailed RedHat, got a canned response, seemed encouraging for an individual using CentOS 8, but unclear how that would work for organizations. Should be possible for individuals to keep a specific version, but unclear for a company. RedHat seems to be taking a wait and see attitude. | Blog post: CentOS Stream: Building an innovative future for enterprise Linux . | FAQ: CentOS Stream Updates . | Ryan: CentOS 7 EOL is 2024, seems to be that there’s some time. | JF: We can’t really wait for a plan announced a week before CentOS 8 EOL? . | Aloys: CentOS Stream may still be reasonably stable, so could still be a viable solution for studios? You can still gate updates if you want. But what should you be building against? You can easily end up releasing software built against “too new” dependencies. We already have similar problems: aswf-docker is building images based on the official centos:7 image, which would pull in 7.8, whereas most studios may still be running older CentOS versions. We should be aware of this, we might want to lock our Docker base images on a specific CentOS version. | Andrew: could become an issue, saw EPEL discussion about creating “EPEL Next” to follow “tip of stream”, whereas EPEL would follow current release. In particular llvm can cause incompatibilities during certain upgrades, every point release of RHEL has different point releases of LLVM which can cause binary incompatibilities. EPEL community is already seeing this. | Ryan: Streams is moving from a downstream release of RHEL to an upstream releases of RHEL, so losing the testing / validation that RH was doing on RHEL before. Losing some guarantee of stability, especially if we are picking our own release. | Andrew: LF is still having internal discussions of what they are going to do, was going to target CentOS 8, current “pets” are still CentOS 7. May end up containerize even more than was planning to do to help better control those systems. Sysadmins at LF prefer something like CentOS because of the controls, but may end up considering Debian (not Ubuntu) . | Mark: original push for CentOS was a “cheap” way to get RHEL, could still get an Enterprise license to access RedHat support. VFX industry might look to another enterprise Linux provider (Ubuntu / SuSE / ???) . | Andrew: Oracle Linux was discussed, it is essentially CentOS rebuilt by Oracle with their own kernel, but have option to run the RHEL kernel. There’s a script to convert CentOS to Oracle Linux. But then Oracle could change the licensing terms. | Mitch / Andrew: Rocky Linux is happening, but how long will it take to get infrastructure up and running and enough of the distro rebuilt. | Andrew: Linux Foundation is specifically not in the business to be a distro provider. | Mitch: not a huge problem to “pay for something of value”: providing the value is worth the price. Andrew: yes, but RHEL itself is very expensive. But not a great model for render farm. | Mark: hardware support from a commercial entity is also important. Also being able to point software vendors at a specific platform. SideFX may support Ubuntu as well as CentOS / RHEL. | . | . Follow ups . | GPU Build &amp; Test . | Document OCIO setup in Template project (JF) . | Any updates on GitHub secret handling? (Andrew) . | . | ASWF-docker updates . | Documentation . | Docker Hub repository changes. | Application for Open-Source status? (Andrew) | . | Releasing new 2021 set of images with the right Qt version, got help from Autodesk which shared build recipe, a few additional packages required for Qt 5.15. | Some activity from people trying to use the download package script, some documentation issues that need to be cleaned up to explain how this works. | Have a branch that’s not quite ready for merging to split each package into a package YAML file, trying to model the dependencies of all the packages we maintain in aswf-docker. Looking at how we could use something like rez / spk or at least have a good model of the dependencies between packages, and the variants between packages. | We’ve discussed in the past the difference between having the version number in the package YAML file, Ryan has ideas about how not to have to do that so that your package definition is valid for all versions. Rez / SPK increment the version in the package definition YAML. Sometimes also need to maintain versions across ranges of package versions. Somewhat of a detail, but still an interesting challenge for package management systems to manage a range of versions without having to branch the repo for each version / maintain a different package definition file for each version. AL has those issues internally for a few hundred Rez packages maintained in a Git repo, trying to make that maintainable, but often end up having to duplicate entire folders with package definition files, CMakefiles… Hard to maintain, hard to review. Definitely interesting issues to explore / push on in the context of packaging. It’s a different problem from having the package definition with the source code. Aswf-docker needs to maintain the last 2 or 3 versions of everything. | Ryan: agree, one of the design choices of SPK is to have the package definition in the source code repo, where it makes sense to have the package version, but there is a good use case for having package definitions that work across versions. | Mark: if package definitions are inside the code, you require checkout of all the code just to discover those versions. ILM has lots of different version control systems, not always easy to mix and match, so not having to clone all of the code bases is useful. | Ryan: had interesting discussion with folks at Netflix around package management, maybe there’s a larger effort that can be put together to come up with a package definition format rather than a package manager, so that we don’t have to adopt wholesale a methodology to build and release software, but at least having an agreed upon format for package definition. | Aloys: followed the Rez-style YAML format, simple and easy, but yes, a standard way would be useful. | Larry: it seems hard to believe that there isn’t something out there that’s close enough to our needs, that we could convince the owners to extend for our needs. There’s always something specific to our industry that isn’t captured by available formats? Seems weird to have to start from scratch for just a package description. | Ryan: agree, but there’s a weird line between build system and package managers, and that line gets crossed all the time. One of the great usability features of Rez is that it is also a build system, build all the software you need with all resolved dependencies. Separating to “just” package definitions may be difficult, you would lose a lot of usability and convenience. | Mark: quite a lot of the work is done around building entire distributions. Gentoo Portage seems to be the closest to our needs, but huge overkill for what we need. But sometimes our systems do need that level of flexibility to build stuff. | Aloys: like the idea of having a standard way of defining packages and dependencies, what’s the ordered list of dependencies to get a package. Would need this to generate complete Docker images that are well defined. The build side could be an implementation detail. So there could be a use for a lightweight spec. | Ryan: are you deploying the software as a package, the source code as a package, or the compiled binaries as a package? Very different compatibility requirements. | Mark: when you have a static package definition, often you get into situations where you want to do conditional logic / express some sort of control flow structure, can be really clumsy when dealing with static (YAML) files. Easier to do in code / a dynamic language. | Ryan: in a lot of ways it leads you towards CMake as a standard, but there are things it doesn’t describe / some clumsiness. But now crossing into a build system. Is it reasonable to find something that expresses everything we need? . | Mark: end up in environment management as well, would be nice to store those in some sort of immutable fashion . | Ryan: you end back to Rez / SPK . | Robin: what’s the difference between Rez / SPK and a CMake-based system? Ryan: Cmake is just for build and install, it doesn’t do environment management. Also Cmake doesn’t do any dependency management, maintaining a “FindX” module is tricky. Also Cmake builds one package, Rez integrates with Cmake if that’s your chosen build system. | What about YAML + Jinja2? Ryan: Conda does that, they’ve managed to shove everything they need in there, but some of the files end up looking very complicated, and very hard to maintain. It “can work”, but it’s not ideal. | Andrew: LF has 3 classes of tooling in projects supported by RelEng team. Largest is Java-based, they are all using Maven, which has the ability to express with packages which dependencies you depend on, within a version range, can also skip particular versions, will pull down latest version it can that meets those specifications. Second most popular language is Python, pip has similar capabilities, “I depend on a package within a particular revision set”. Often we get bitten by packages that don’t specify versions they depend on, and then an upstream package introduces an incompatible version that breaks builds. So sometimes have to pin to specific versions, but that’s not desirable (like to build “top of tree”). Third most popular language is Go: Go modules are Git based, typically point at a Git SHA or HEAD, they also strictly use semantic versioning. LF tries to push projects towards semver, but some projects push back (semver too strict for them). LF RelEng team champions SemVer, communicates lots of info to downstream projects. | LF RelEng team is 10 engineers, supporting 12-15 different major projects, majority of these projects are networking based, OpenDaylight is one of the largest projects (although project size is going down). Also ONAP (Open Networking Automation Platform), between those two projects, supporting on the order of 500-1000 active developers, no idea how many downstreams since these projects are consumed by major products. Cisco builds their network controller on top of OpenDaylight, AT&amp;T runs 90% of their wireless infrastructure on top of ONAP. Getting these projects to mainly use SemVer has helped keep them stable. | Andrew: most of the breakage happens on the Python side, less so in Java. Most of the breakage is in LF’s own tooling for Jenkins based CI. Try to find commonalities between projects and write tools to avoid duplication of effort. But tooling has grown organically, so don’t always have test coverage for every part of a tool. Seeing this in CI tools since tend to always pull from HEAD. Somewhat less likely to see these issues if you are methodical about your updates. | Mark: within ASWF there aren’t so many projects, and they are mostly “good players”. Inside VFX facilities, you may be in the “wild west”. Andrew: see this with the LF tooling, projects can use the tooling in unexpected ways, community members can submit fixes back to LF RelEng. Don’t have “major shifts” like going from Python 2 to 3. | Mark: we’re being a bit more rigid since most VFX facilities don’t have a lot of engineering support for builds. | Andrew: RelEng staffing is based on needs of LF projects, from partial headcount / consulting role, to full time engineers for specific projects (OpenDaylight pays for 2 full time engineers to support CI / build). Trying to leverage work done between different projects. | Andrew: work that Aloys has done with aswf-docker, if companies rally around this, then that can help the industry in general. Systems need to be “opinionated” to make a difference. That’s why RelEng team is a strong proponent of SemVer, a set of guidelines that we will try to enforce. Also a high bar for code review policies. Have a code repo that manages those CI systems, release engineers have maintainer rights, but in some projects, the community is self sufficient enough to maintain that. | . | Mac CI . | MacStadium / Developer Transition Kits . | JF to prototype integration between an ASWF project and Orka build: in progress, hoping to have sample build of OCIO before EOD . | Basic design based on VM . | Jira ticket open to share credentials with LF RelEng team, add LF RelEng as admin on the MacStadium subscription . | M1 based Mac Minis available soon from MacStadium . | AWS now offering ECS Mac instances for CI builds . | . | . | Project feedback . | .

    "content": ". | ASWF Project and Community Survey (John / Emily) . | Please forward and evangelize . | Daniel: the wider the distribution, the better. The information being collected is just for sorting / analysis, that part won’t be shared . | Should be sent to the VFX Platform mailing list (Daniel todo). | Ken: discussed in the TSC, all of the TSC members were complaining that there is a very long list of questions that you have to go through before you get to a specific project. Could there be a direct link that you could point to the relevant part of the survey? . | Daniel: to be discussed with Emily, can we discuss this on Slack? . | Got posted to 3D Pro . | . | Working Groups . | CI . | Discussions on CentOS stream, update on aswf-docker | . | Diversity &amp; Inclusion . | Meeting is happening concurrently, so schedule clash . | First webinar on 25th Feb . | . | Python 3 . | USD . | Cory: well attended meeting this year, discussion of delivery and visualization of USD assets with web technology. Took a look at USD Playground project (see USD-wg wiki). Will have a presentation at the next session from Roman Zulek (sp?) to look at 3D web technology for USD. Group may create a sub WG on that topic. | Had good discussion / revisited USD Camera, started a sub WG for USD camera to agree on what a typical structure for a USD camera would look like, creation of a common camera rig (lots of interest at Netflix for multi-studio projects). Will report back to USD WG in a couple of sessions. | Talked about Omniverse, now in open beta, future role of OmniVerse, may be getting a presentation on the extension mechanism for OmniVerse. | Small discussion about backlot technologies, how people are storing assets in a digital backlot, Pixar is doing that, so will try to gather some information on that topic. | Lots on the agenda for 2021! . | . | Review &amp; Approval . | Larry: there has been another meeting, continue to see 2-3 demos from relevant systems, probably one more round of “show and tell” | . | Asset Repository . | Michael: lively discussion, what should an asset repo for ASWF be, Eric had summary, “first make it easy”, check in with John about licensing. Try to make these assets to the ASWF projects as well as to the larger membership. Moana keeps coming up as an example of what we would like to see from other studios / projects. One of the suggestions would be “how could you carve out of that project things that could be of value to projects”. For instance turning this large 3D asset into USD, but could we also get a bunch of EXRs with AOVs with contemporary naming structure, types of AOVs. Also OTIO timelines. | Think about Blender content, studio content. If we got “big” assets, how we would convert those into actual assets such as OSL shaders, EXR files, OTIO cutlists, OpenVDB datasets… . | A bunch of action items, notes are being kept in the Wiki . | Cary: had exchange with WDA, Moana scene was set up to render in a single pass without a lot of AOVs, so that data isn’t readily available. The problem they have is keeping the dataset up to date, version control on these kinds of assets is not easy, is this something we could figure out? It’s way too large for GitHub (100+ GB). How can you do version control and maintenance on such assets. | Wave: Pixar uses Perforce for digital backlot, at Apple can use anything. Currently using git-lfs (Large File extension for Git). Please come to next meeting to discuss this. | Daniel: versioning problem was explicitly discussed early on in the WG. Lots of things can create the dataset to change, do you want to continuously update it, or keep it fixed for regression testing? . | . | Rust . | Daniel: there was interest in the last TAC meeting to connect with the Rust meeting? We should make space for that. | Scott: first meeting on Saturday to figure out plan for 2021. Talking about becoming a Working Group, what do we need to do to make the request. What do we want to see done before the end of the year (or sooner). | Starting with the big “where do we want to go, what do we want to be” discussions . | Kimball: doing a new C layer for OpenEXR, how can we get feedback from Rust community. | Scott: looking to create a tool to automatically create C bindings. Don’t duplicate effort. Designed for a specific project, but generic for all ASWF libraries. | Daniel: TAC supporter should be involved with Rust community (preferably?). Daniel: will try to join the meeting. Sean: happy to sponsor it as well. | . | . | Technical Project updates . | OCIO . | Michael: need testers for v2 before official release, testing activity at Autodesk and Foundry. | Version for Reference Platform 2021: want to switch OCIO version from 2.0.x to 2.x, since there are likely to be desirable minor releases this year. In particular OCIO is likely to be home for new ACES 1.3 gamut mapping (around April) . | Kimball: congrats for 2.0RC1 ! . | Daniel: does 2.x in Reference Platform mean that there should be forward / backward compatibility within that range? . | Michael: minor releases wouldn’t change any existing APIs, just add new ones (additional transform types). Would have to be careful. OpenVDB currently has their minor version as ‘x’ in Reference Platform. | Larry: doesn’t this create an issue, if you add API calls for 2.1 for instance, you no longer have forward compatibility. Unless you are committed to all the 2.x compatible in both forward / backward direction? . | Michael: good point, but there will be useful functionality that will land before end of 2021. Has this been an issue for OpenVDB? . | Ken: no, it hasn’t. Major version guarantees ABI compatibility, but can have API changes between minor versions. But have symbol versioning / namespacing to help. | Michael: also have namespacing . | Larry: 2020 VFX platform supported EXR 2.4, 2021 says 3.0, but in the meantime OpenEXR had a 2.5 release that is somewhat of an orphan release that falls between platform releases. We haven’t come to a conclusion about that. | Michael: that was discussed at OCIO, they have an OpenEXR dependency (currently 2.4), may result in a version bump for OCIO when EXR goes to 3.0? . | Daniel: could be an issue if you pass EXR images around in the API. | Michael: OCIO uses the Half library, so will be depending on imath rather than OpenEXR . | Daniel: a version that wants to call a new API won’t work with the old version. So you need to always have the newest version applicable to the VFX Reference Platform year (currently the case with OpenVDB and TBB). | Ken: the OpenVDB policy has been around for 5 years without a problem. Houdini is built against OpenVDB 6.0, then we release 6.5, so in Houdini you can do a reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt; of the grid, and can call the new APIs. It has been stable and hasn’t cause issues. But it does require care and namespacing. | . | OpenVDB . | Ken: released 8.0 2 weeks ago, Ax is the JIT language from DNeg. | Next milestone is NanoVDB: GPU friendly slimmed down version, lives in a feature branch, needs to be moved to master branch (already used by many). | Used to use cppunit for unit testing, now using ttest. Have a very small dependency on OpenEXR, but trying to limit external dependencies. Scaling back on Boost, TBB. | Using EXR core libraries for images, also use “half” a lot, will include that component of ilmBase directly. | Not getting rid of TBB, but getting rid of TBB threads. May introduce wrappers, useful since embracing GPUs, so may want to be able to do threading on the host vs GPU. | OpenVDB is 2 main components; a data structure, and a set of tools. There’s currently a blurry line between the two, a lot of the tools live as methods on the data structure. Trying to separate the two, moving these methods into tools. Helps with optimization and extending the data structure. This is a long process, started with this in 8.0 (which changed the ABI). There’s not a lot of difference between 7.2 and 8.0 (Ax was already in 7.2), but had to change the major version for ABI breakage. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: 2.5.4 release over the holiday breaks. Bugs / security fixes from the oss-fuzz reports. Did that pending the 3.0 release. | Getting closer with iMath split, but wanted to release the security fixes in a less disruptive form than the 3.0 release. | Lots to discuss at next TSC: tie up the loose ends. Kimball has started major rewrite of core I/O releases (thread friendly), but won’t be part of 3.0 release (which will be mostly an organizational change). | . | OSL . | Chris: CLA has gone through, contributors are signing it, expecting changeover to ASWF GitHub very soon. | . | OTIO . | Josh: more approvals on the Disney side for the CLA changes, some more steps required, check in with John on that topic. | OTIO is also aiming to use iMath once the separate is complete, looking forward to that, and happy to be early testers. | Discussion about storing color information, color primaries, profiles in OTIO. Will reach out to OCIO project to get some guidance to make sure we are complementary to other projects. | Made progress on CII badge, remaining outstanding issue is getting comfortable with the questions about the security process. Tentatively looking at doing some training for the team. | . | OpenCue . | Brian: not too much update, no TSC meeting this year. Doing some housekeeping, laying out priorities for this year, eagerly waiting survey results. Seeing renewed interest in finishing up CII badge process, SonarCloud. | . | Camera Raw . | adopted for incubation status at last TAC meeting, not further progress over the holidays, but will start this month | . | . | Cary: what happened to the discussion about renaming the “master” branch, we were waiting on some GitHub changes? Larry: guidance from GitHub was “wait for new tools”, but does GitHub have this in place? Daniel: there was some pushback from the broader community, if the majority of projects out there are converging to a naming convention, you would have to have a strong reason to use something else. But probably worth taking up again? Can be discussed on the #wg-ci Slack channel. | Goals for ASWF: 2021 . | What are other projects we want to start in 2021 instead of just adopting? . | Helping projects with dependencies for instance | . | Daniel: Review working group, data repository / assets are potential sources of new technical projects . | CII badging for OpenCue and OTIO are scheduled in the next 6 months, projects to graduate (Josh: yes for OTIO) . | Kimball: perhaps we could have Python scripts to manage versions . | . | Next meeting: January 27, 2021 . | .

So raising awareness of general membership / plugging membership could be something worth doing at FMX. Encourage discussions within studios of general membership, especially in context of lot of studios making use of ASWF projects. Encourage “giving back”. | . | Open Source Forum: . | March 10th, each working group to present a brief 5 minute update . | Verizon and (?) will present . | HyperLedger will present . | Jim Zeller (LF CEO) will present . | Towards more exec level people . | Share at discretion with colleagues / execs who should be there . | . | Working Group updates . | CI: no meeting since last TAC meeting, notes just got merged into repo . | D&amp;I . | Carol: by end of week / early next week, should have schedule and speakers locked down for webinar series, Emily working on copy so it can be shared, we should spread within our networks . | First webinar on Feb 25th . | . | Python 3 . | Ashley: continuing to work on transition guide, another round of speaking to studios about how far they are in Python 3 conversion. Still very early days, several studios where Python 3 is more of a “grassroots effort” rather than an official program. | . | USD . | Wave: meeting on USD camera, good representation. Broke it up into a couple of parts: camera based on a physical rig, other part on the physically based camera optics, tracking, metadata that you would get from a live action shoot, how would you track that metadata through a CG pipeline. Handed out “homework assignments”, what would a USD hierarchy look like. Also looking at sensor, camera lens metadata. | Corey: will get update next session from Camera. Working on web delivery of USD assets using WebRTC, there’s a video to share, video size is too large for the Wiki. What about YouTube, do we need to clear with any presenters? Should come out shortly. | In upcoming sessions, will try to edit presentations out of Zoom calls. | Roman Zulak presentation, 3 or 4 different parties working on projects in this space (USD web delivery), is it worth creating a sub WG for this specific topic? . | . | Asset Group . | Wave: presentation to the board . | Trying to build OTIO timeline (reached out to OTIO) . | Talking to Disney about Moana to leverage the asset, USD version coming soon . | Discussions on licensing, John + LF lawyer shared some info, it’s complicated . | Reaching out to Camera manufacturers to see if we can get production footage from them . | Discussion about keeping the recipe for an asset around instead of a “backed good”: Moana asset is very large, does Disney want to continue to host it? Turns out it’s more of a “working document” than expected, do you really want to regenerate a 150GB asset every time you make a fix / change, or a set of pieces you can download, and a recipe / Python script to regenerate the full asset . | . | Rust Saturday . | Sean: meeting went well, lot of energy and enthusiasm around Rust for the projects we oversee, as well as other ideas . | Notes are posted to Rust Slack channel . | Next step is to fill out the WG template so we can present a vote to the TAC, targeting next TAC meeting for a proposal vote, establish the goals of the WG . | In parallel lots of other work being done, working on bindings . | Next meeting in 2 days . | . | WG status and approvals . | Need to access goals / non goals of various WGs, getting all the details right . | Wave: discussed, seems not trivial . | Sean: came up in Rust meeting, lots of different opinions. Scott taking the lead in distilling down to a set of goals / non goals . | Kimball: we want to maintain a sense of engagement / excitement . | . | . | Technical Project updates . | OSL . | Chris: we have CLAs signed by all major parties, move the repo to the ASWF GitHub organization, which is a big step | . | OpenCue . | Brian: update from last TSC meeting, as part of drive to make OpenCue easier to deploy, starting to coordinate an effort between cloud providers and people who run infrastructure, putting together docs and scripts, for instance using Terraform. Please reach out to Brian to help work on publishing this information, and do a PR push on mailing list. | . | OCIO . | Michael: from last TAC meeting, changing of changing version in VFX Reference Platform, decided not to do it, staying with 2.0.x, makes more sense / safer . | Plan on pushing v2 tag within next 24h, 3 years of work just about done. Exciting to finally get that out there. | Agreed to work towards changing CCLA over to the ASWF standard to be consistent with other projects. Not doing it yet since in support mode for new v2 release, but looking to do this in next couple of months. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: switched over to the new CLA . | Working towards 3.0 release and imath, nothing like being “really close” to realize how much is left to do. Chipping away at it, release should be soon . | . | OpenVDB, OTIO . | No representatives | . | RAW2aces . | Kimball: need to have meeting with ACES | . | . | Goals for ASWF: 2021 redux . | D&amp;I: Adobe . | Bill Roberts: push for D&amp;I at Adobe (with Van Bedient) . | 10 minute summary . | Kimball: ASWF has lots of projects / building blocks, but our group should figure out how to put these building blocks together so we can enable other communities to do interesting things. New projects that could reach out to newer generations to get them interested in M&amp;E? . | Adobe For All: how can we give back . | Want to be agent of change beyond the company . | Brought in guest speakers: Dr Gregory Carr, Nikole Hannah-Jones (1619 NY Times project) . | Adobe allows employees to spend time on projects . | Community . | Growth &amp; Advancement . | Hiring &amp; Recruiting . | Responsibility &amp; Advocacy . | Transparency &amp; Governance . | . | Responsibility &amp; Advocacy: trying to target 13-18 age bracket, people who are “selecting out” of technical or artistic tracks due to lack of representation. Providing software and hardware to help. | Creating a framework that can be shared with others. | Core Principles - Open Source Framework . | There is no “winning” - only getting to what is right and fair as quickly as possible - for all . | We need to move entire industries: . | Photography and Imaging . | Design . | Video . | 3D and Interactive . | Other? . | . | . | Adobe Contributions . | Open Source repositories of areas of focus . | Great response from other manufacturers . | . | Model to drive adoption across creative industries . | Interested organizations (creative tools, content creators, industry organizations) | . | Next Steps: . | Feedback: Socialize and solicit input - internal and external to Adobe . | Consolidation: look for similar programs - integrate, align or include . | Roll Out: prepare the first repository and roll out . | Inspect &amp; Adapt: report out (quarterly and annually), modify per inputs . | . | Kimball: there’s clear crossover with our own D&amp;I initiatives, what ideas can we come up with . | Carol: want to work together and be aligned, doesn’t necessarily need to happen as a direct part of the WG, but could be a separate ASWF project that the D&amp;I WG could contribute and profit from . | Kimball: software doesn’t have to be code, it can be web sites to help people communicate for instance. | We can bring this up at next TAC group, think of ideas / projects that could fit, get our companies to contribute. | Larry: Bill, do you have a slide deck you could share, also for the other groups and categories? Bill: yes, but have to clear what can be shared first. Applying Agile methodologies to what they want to achieve, should be able to share more soon. | . | Google Summer of Code . | Larry: deadline is coming up soon, we need to have an application finalized in next 3-4 weeks if we want to do this again . | Google has changed the program, estimated number of hours cut in half (and stipend). “Worthwhile” projects where students could have a real accomplishment to point to seemed to already be on the edge of what an undergrad could do in 12 weeks, so before we make an application, asking project leads whether they have project ideas that could be done in 6 weeks. If we have the right projects, we can do an application, but otherwise we can skip it. | Kimball: if Google is cutting things in half, should we push for our own program? Carol: the current plan is to do that, we got budget approved for our version of inclusion-based summer internship (3 @ $6K each, this isn’t set in stone for now). Based on experience from GSoC last summer. | Emily: starting with 3 this year, can expand to more next year. If there are more projects that want a full length student, could ask for more budget. | Wave: Academy Sci-Tech may have other internship programs, for instance production-based projects (rather than code). Also we don’t necessarily have to do it in the summer (currently leading a “spring intern”). Carol: is this the Academy Gold program? D&amp;I group working on trying to link up with Academy efforts. | Carol: efforts don’t have to be mutually exclusive, but if projects feel that a “full time intern” is more productive, they want to hear that feedback. | Larry: we don’t need to organize these efforts completely separately, we can think of it as “funding from different places”, between different programs, we have a set of resources to meet both D&amp;I and technical goals. | Kimball: we should probably still target GSoC for smaller projects . | Larry: talked to GSoC organizers, “the program doesn’t exist for the project but for the students”, so they felt they could reach out to more students, want to allow more students to “dip their toes” into participating to open source projects, rather than targeting larger contributions to those projects. They will try this for a year or 2 and adjust accordingly. For many open source projects, it’s probably a boon, our specialized projects which require specialist knowledge may benefit less from shorter involvements. | Kimball: what kind of contributions are they accepting? Cary/ Larry: has to be code, can’t be documentation, assets. Kimball: could it be regression testing? Larry: as long as the primary deliverable has to be code. They have a corresponding “Season of Doc” program for non-code contributions, which we could also look at. | Larry: still targets college / university level students, in general terms, looking to give more people opportunities, even if these are shallower . | . | New Projects? . | . | Next meeting . | 10 Feb 2021 . | Likely will have a proposal from Rust . | Wave: WG may also have proposal . | . | .

    "content": ". | GPU Build &amp; Test . | ASWF-docker updates . | VFX Platform 2021 Containers . | Aloys: everything has been released, only package that hasn’t been there yet is OpenEXR 3.0, but it doesn’t exist yet! Added latest version of OCIO in the last few hours. | Mark: found some build issues with OCIO 2.0, so there may be a 2.0.1 coming soon. Aloys: happy to help troubleshoot. Mark: not exporting any of the Cmake targets, so some of the targets aren’t being generated. Larry has put some workarounds in OIIO. Aloys: that’s something that has changed from 1.x? Mark: yes, bug has been around for a while in betas, hasn’t been caught yet. | Aloys: if there’s a new release with the CMake fix, happy to pull that in. We can discuss this issue in #wg-ci Slack channel. | OCIO 2.0 was officially released last week, the announcement may not have gone out to the mailing list, but it is on GitHub, there’s a release tag. ASWF won’t be doing an actual press release since there was already one done for the “feature complete” status. | Aloys: was using RC1 previously, but saw the 2.0 target a few days ago, so that’s what got incorporated into the VFX 2021. | Patrick: Reference Platform 2021 specifies OCIO 2.0.x . | Daniel: container distribution, earlier discussion on that topic. Do we know how much traffic we are generating from Docker Hub, and whether we are hitting any of the limits in the new service tiers? Andrew: no info on the traffic, but Docker has been very silent about requests for “open source rights” against LF repositories, only 2 projects have been granted, the others are having “radio silence” in 2.5 months, so don’t really know what’s going on. | Daniel: do we know if we are being throttled? Andrew: no, we decided to pay for Team access, our CI is using a paid account, and so is Aloys, but potentially others pulling our containers could be throttled if they are using Docker Hub anonymously. Daniel: that could affect projects such as OSL if they are part of our organization? Andrew: yes, if they have moved to using the ASWF org GitHub runners. They would be able to use the unlimited pulls. | Daniel: do we need to take any steps for our projects? Larry / Patrick, is this in place and working? Larry: only 1 week into having moved the repository, so haven’t tried any of this stuff, have been stalled on GPU builds, haven’t used secrets before, so there’s lot to do. | Christian: is Docker Hub the goto for packages? Andrew: publishing on GitHub for containers has had problems, they have rewritten their container system 3 times so far, their current iteration has some issues with hosting containers. We could try it, but until GitHub gets it right, it’s probably not a good idea. Also having people pulling our images from something else than Docker Hub means they have to jump through hoops. The simple solution of just having it in the central registry that everyone uses (Docker Hub) is usually the solution that works. Hopefully we can actually fall under the open source “unlimited pulls” license. | Aloys: also concerned with the multi-gig size of our images, GitHub and Microsoft have limits on individual file sizes. | Daniel: Chrisitan, are you interested in avoiding GitHub issues by using a different repository, or interested in making it like a “binary release” that people can just use? Christian: we ran into the Docker Hub throttling, which was an issue. Andrew: were you using anonymous or registered? Christian: anonymous. Andrew: registered account gets 2x the quota. For other projects, went with the Team account (not that expensive), or a single paid for account (for instance your CI account). Owners of Docker are trying to recoup bandwidth costs. | . | Secrets Handling . | Daniel: forking, GPU builds. Andrew: only way to access GPUs is through CodeBuild, requires LF RelEng to set up on a project by project basis. | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ypy95ozoNcLv11GrTqK0Z_4bpfKGpEyCXjUSNEKGylE/edit# Using Pull Request Target as a trigger workflow allows you to do triggering inside the receiving end repository in PRs, so those PRs would have access to all secrets. There’s a big red warning in that description. | Those workflows would always trigger using the job definition in the source repository. So that’s one way for PRs to use organization secrets. | Andrew: it is a GitHub Action you define in the central repo that says “any PR that comes in can trigger this job, that would have access to secrets”. No way to control where the PR comes from. It does allow for a project to create workflows that they are willing to have automatically run. So for instance we could authorize the CodeBuild jobs for all PRs. It does mean that anyone can raise a PR and consume resources we pay for. In all honesty that’s not very different on how LF’s other CI workflows (based on Jenkins) work. | Is it worth it, or do we need to keep a tighter rein on finances? . | JF: is there a way to put a maximum run time on a CodeBuild job? Andrew: yes. In LF Jenkins env we have a 6hr job limit, but some projects cap to limit of 60 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes. Workflow Syntax for GitHub Actions - ObsJob IdTimeout . | Daniel: this can be a “break glass” mechanism. | Andrew: there’s now at least the option to use org secrets in a PR. | . | Mac CI . | JF: No new update, MacStadium ramping up accessibility of Apple Silicon Mac Minis . | Daniel: are projects seeing demand for macOS / ARM? OCIO? OSL? . | Larry: not a formal demand, but anticipation that it will be supported sooner rather than later . | . | Project feedback . | Package Management . | We’ve had lots of discussion, any updates? . | Mark: will need to clear the ability to share some of the stuff being worked on at ILM, waiting for a green flag to preset . | Daniel: Ryan / Larry were putting out a “call for interest”, any bites? Ryan: haven’t received a ton of interest, so it’s still on the table, but the conversation didn’t really continue after this meeting. Larry:had some discussions with people from Netflix, they aren’t looking to partner up on development, but could be interested in defining package definitions. Also topic came up in context of OpenEXR. But Kimball / WETA hadn’t seen the presentation, pointed them to the recorded talk, but don’t know if it got viewed (WETA dealing with same issues that SPI’s solution is trying to address). But no one has outright said they would jump in and collaborate. So not clear if SPI is going to do, whether just go internal, share informally, “go big”. Started conversations with legal department in case SPI decides to share at least some of the code. | Daniel: at Animal Logic, have a CentOS upgrade cycle happening at the moment , looking at all the busy work involved. Overspecification of the Rez packages they have defined. Also looking at the transition to CentOS Stream, does an effective somewhat higher level package management system become part of the OS management, that could be a useful marshalling point for the efforts. | Jeff: have been investigating running inside containers, it’s been successful (making the actual OS irrelevant). Packaging up all the software inside containers, executing them and getting great functionality from that, including DCCs. It’s still early in the process, but showing a lot of promise. Hardest thing has been overcoming the “that’s not what Docker is for” argument. Using Dockers as VMs. Ryan: access to the GPU has been a struggle. Jeff: seems to be working now, the NVIDIA Docker containers. | Aloys: have also been experimenting with Singularity, which gives more access to external capabilities. There’s a VFX Docker image he’s converted to a Singularity image on the Singularity hub. | Jeff: looked at Singularity, liked it, user-facing container technology. Don’t need to give root, opening up the security a bit more for the users. Have been able to do a lot of what Singularity does in Docker by wrapping their own tools. Also like the layering of Docker, whereas Singularity is “singular”. Maybe starting with Docker, eventually pulling in Docker layers into Singularity. | Daniel: Jeff, could you do a 20 minute presentation in the next meeting? Jeff: sure. Ryan: very interested in seeing this. Still end up needing a package management system, could use SPK to bake out the filesystem and putting it into the image. | Jeff: also use Rez internally, this is a proven Rez environment, suck it into a Rez container. Also want to start using the ASWF containers, not leveraging those at this point, takes months to build their own VFX Platform compliant environments. | Aloys: Rez is the “last mile”, every day you have dozens / hundreds of new small packages, dozens of releases every day, so can’t afford to repackage a whole Docker image all the time. Also the ASWF Docker images have problems, projects can decide they want their own version of something (like pybind11) instead of depending on something that’s part of the image. Would like to be able to use a package management system on top of the ASWF containers. | Larry: frequently wish could have the SPK solution in CI. VFX Platform 2021 is one entry in the test matrix, but rest of matrix is a lot of oddball combinations, can’t all be Docker containers. | Aloys: have a hacky solution that uses Docker containers as “glorified tar file”: package is tared and wrapped in a Docker container. But there are limits as to what you can do to pass Docker images between GitHub Actions CI build stages. Aswf-docker tool is available on PyPI. But within the Docker container, you can download the packages you want, need to install Docker within the Docker image, not ideal. This is why JFrog looks interesting, individual file sizes (Qt is 500MB) can be quite large. A JFrog instance with enough capacity to store these packages could be very useful. | Daniel: isn’t this a custom package manager? Aloys: happy to use a different solution. Andrew: Podman / Buildah are ways to build Docker images that separate the container runtime from building the images, don’t require a daemon. You can build rootless containers. Buildah lets you build containers without needing the runtime. Ryan: also allows you to build the layers independently. Larry: there is a published caching action in GitHub Actions that didn’t exist when first switched from Travis, it can help not incur the cost of building the same dependency over and over. There may be a limit of 5GB, not sure if it was possible to force an invalidation of the cache. Looking at whether it could help cut down on CI build times. Aloys: submitted a PR to use caching / ccache against USD repo, first build is 40 min, but next one is 5 min. Larry: would love to see that. Daniel: caching of the build process rather than the result itself. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | General Easy-CLA Upgrade Announcement (John) . | LF team getting ready for a major upgrade, v1 to v2 in the near future . | If you are a contributor, should not see any changes . | If you are one of the managers for the organization (who is granted under the CCLA), there will be a webinar in the next week or 2 outlining the changes, how to use the tool . | If you see any issues, please let us know / file tickets with LF support . | Michael: could there be a one CCLA manager for the organization across multiple projects / one for the whole ASWF? John: the issue is more a legal issue since each project is in a different legal entity, and the CLAs have specific language referring to the specific project. Closest we’ve gotten to has been to keep the terms as identical as possible between projects, but difficult to have a single CLA across entities. | Michael: if a company has contributors across 3 projects, would be easier if the language was identical, but sounds like the answer is no. | John: may be a different question, worth raising with the CCLA team. | Daniel: when we have questions about process, is the ticketing system the right way to find the point of contact within LF? John: if there are direct issues with the tools (access, bugs), then ticketing system is the right answer. If it’s more questions about the CLA itself, probably best to reach to John directly. | Some projects still working on moving to the 2020 V2.1 CLA . | . | Upcoming Events . | Kimball: thank you Emily for all your work! Emily: I’ve really enjoyed working with ASWF over the last 2 years, proud of what we’ve accomplished. Have been part of many communities, this is one of the most active and engaged. Heading to enterprise tech company, not in the M&amp;E space. Will still be part of some D&amp;I meetings. | FMX . | Thank you for everyone who submitted submissions. Last day is Friday, will be connecting with the FMX people. Jam packed with great content. | . | Open Source Forum . | John will take the lead to send the invites for that | . | ASWF: Survey results have just been sent . | . | Google Summer of Code (Larry) . | Application deadline coming up . | Larry: deadline before the next TAC meeting, wanted to share update. OCIO has said they would like to do it, OTIO said no, OSL is going through the motions to see if they have any ideas, haven’t heard from other projects. If we don’t hear from a couple of other projects, then we will likely not make an ASWF application (OCIO could make its own application). | Michael: could OCIO do it under the ASWF organization to help with continuity? Larry: seems odd to do it under the organization if only one project is ready to submit under the new task size rules. | Michael: just curious, last year there was some language about being a “first time organization”. Larry: could explain that you are part of an org that has done it before. | Deadline is the 20th. Kimball: will talk about it in OpenEXR TSC . | Josh: OTIO had great experience last year, only issue this year is lack of bandwidth. Encourage other projects to do it. | . | Project Updates . | Technical Project updates . | OSL . | Chris: no big updates, move to ASWF GitHub org has gone OK, lots of activity on the GPU front, execution on CPUs. | . | OpenCue . | OCIO . | Michael: official announcement of v2 release, getting good feedback, implementation in studios and DCCs . | UX WG, representatives from studios and users, how can we create a consistent experience for users . | GSoC: looking for projects that fit the shorter timeframe. Also looking at projects for D&amp;I fellowship. Looking at implementing OCIO in ffmpeg, some updates to ffmpeg may have improved ability to get FP data from buffers. Also a set of OFX OCIO plugins to stand as examples. Larry: could propose to the ffmpeg group and volunteer to help mentor it. Michael: good point. Daniel: great to hear that documentation WG has come full circle. Were discussing the experience of “spinning out” a project WG for documentation. Michael: still on the radar, want to address. Continuing to improve documentation. Daniel: would it be possible to point towards the infrastructure that has been set up? Michael: could do that, have had some contact with other projects that have been referencing it. Kimball: OpenEXR adopting some of those practices, thank you for doing the heavy lifting to organize. | . | OpenEXR . | Cary: keep inching towards 3.0 release, “dot is and cross ts”, fleshing out details. Waiting for legal approval from one of the contributors, we want to include that change, but their legal dept is moving slowly. No set date yet, but “soon”. | . | OpenVDB . | OTIO . | Josh: still working on graduation next steps, some good collaboration with assets WG, some leads on the Blender foundation donating assets | . | RAW2aces . | Kimball: Emailed to get a TSC started | . | . | Working Group updates . | CI . | Daniel: Working on formalizing the structure of the WG but haven’t finished. CI WG proposal Ongoing work on upgrade for VFX Platform 2021, OpenEXR 3. Practical discussions on how to manage the increasingly constrained Docker images (new policies on Docker Hub), but for internal projects and external users (bandwidth throttling). | Also working on Mac builds, especially for the M1 hardware support, should get easier. No strong demand for that yet. | Package management: Ryan’s demo from Sony Imageworks, a stream of activity, next meeting from Jeff Bradley at Dreamworks as to their efforts. | . | D&amp;I . | Carol: just had monthly D&amp;I meeting (12PM Pacific just before TAC). | Career in Film Tech webinar series announcement, everyone is encouraged to share with their networks. | Accompanied with smaller University led webinars (basics of Open Source contribution), partnering with specific universities. Won’t be as widely advertised. Anyone interested in this accompanying content can reach out. | Moving on to scholarship, internship and project ambassador initiatives . | . | Python 3 . | USD . | Cory: great meeting, kicking off new WG to look at web delivery of USD content for visualization, looking at proposal for SIGGRAPH panel . | Report back from early meetings of USD Camera WG, lots of interest / excitement, no specific output yet. | Michael Min: good conversations on USD camera, schemas should be presented at next meeting on Monday . | Lull in presentation scheduling, trying to get engineers from Pixar to present on how USD is used for Digital Backlot, working on presentation for SIGGRAPH, may happen next week . | . | Asset Group . | Wave: made progress towards clarifying what recommendations to the TAC will be, should finish this at the next meeting. Talked about discussing on Slack, but hasn’t happened so far. Please check out the Wiki that has the notes for the various meetings, as well as the Slack channel. | . | Rust . | Has there been a proposal? Sean Looper: Rust WG Proposal . | Rust Slack channel has a lot of activity . | Goals of the WG are: . | To collaborate with ASWF communities to create (or facilitate the creation of) C and Rust bindings which are consistent across projects. | Create tooling to help build the C and Rust bindings. | Define a set of conventions and rules to create a consistent and ergonomic C and Rust interface for the wrapped libraries. | To have the Rust bindings easily accessible through Rust’s crates.io repository, and to give ownership of those bindings to the ASWF. | . | Non-goals of the WG are: . | Re-implementing current C++ libraries in Rust . | In some cases it may make sense: Imath / half type, but in general no plans to re-implement . | . | Deliverables . | Bind Imath and OpenEXR with C and Rust bindings by SIGRAPH . | Create a framework for binding the other libraries . | Kimball: how would these be maintained, in the same repo/ project or separately? How do they get managed? Scott: not sure that we have a clear understanding for that yet, whether the Rust group would manage the bindings themselves, or give the tools to the upstream project to easily manage these bindings. Can work with the project to decide what makes the most sense. Sean: would be concerned (scalability) by an approach where the ownership of the bindings would be centralized. | Daniel: in favor, great to see energy and enthusiasm. Sean: very happy with the goals. Kimball: should we bring this to a vote? . | John: is there a motion? Sean: move a motion, Daniel seconds. | Vote: all ayes, no nays or abstain, Rust WG motion passes. | . | What is next for CI? . | Daniel: makes sense to split out the WG from its direct “under the TAC” (repo) and its charter doc . | Great to check in with TAc and projects as to agreement with focus, or should CI concentrate in other areas? . | Some of this could be folded into the charter template . | Kimball: should it be a formal project or not? Is there any code / scripts? (aswf-docker) . | Daniel: we have a set of organizations / users at the root owned by the ASWF (systems and artifacts used by the CI system). Kimball: are there recipes that should be published to help people build their own Docker images? Daniel: there’s the aswf-docker repo with the recipes used to generate images. | Daniel: making the CI WG a “formal” WG would be a step to make it more visible, including making its own project under the ASWF organization. | Daniel: will take this to the next CI meeting, does it make sense to become an actual ASWF project, or stay as a WG . | . | Michael Min: Could we perhaps discuss Open Asset Model next TAC meeting, and see if it’s something that might apply to the various working groups? Link? . | Early discussions about the Open Asset Model from Autodesk, would be great to get some presentation by Autodesk. Number of projects could benefit from their efforts, maybe speak about this at next TAC meeting? | . | Emily: there was a question in the survey results about documentation, but it doesn’t mention which project, so may want to ignore that answer. Should be available later today / tomorrow morning. | . | Next meeting . | 24 Feb 2021 | . | . ",

Brian: “the last 10% took a long time!” . | . | OCIO . | Michael: talking about ASWF survey at last meeting, how to follow up with people who wanted to contribute to the project . | Moving meeting notes out of the repo and into the ASWF wiki, lower noise in repo. | Carol Payne: applied to GSoC as an independent project, waiting for updates . | . | OpenEXR . | Close to ready for a release, but still some cleanup issues. One of the Linux distro package managers has been finding some issues here and there, glad that got done before a release. Otherwise would have been scrambling to fix issues after public announcement. | Originally said next week for the release, but that’s probably not going to happen. But should have beta release before Open Source Forum. | Larry: all of our CI tests with the ASWF docker containers are careful to have only one version of dependencies installed, so downstream projects can fail to notice that they have OpenEXR 2.0 installed while wanting to test with EXR 3.0 (order of include files…). Can be tricky, and will be good to have a beta. | Cary: complexity about generating bindings for Python 2 and 3 at the same time. Driving the desire for simplicity. | Kimball: time to deprecate the Python 2 bindings… . | Larry: just deleting the old versions is not a good general purpose approach. Still working out the details. Challenging to get the downstream CMake build systems to get the include in the right / desired order. | Kimball: is there general knowledge to be derived, for instance the transition to OCIO 2.0 . | Cary: our CI is testing against an artificially simplistic environment. | . | OpenVDB . | No representative present | . | OTIO . | Josh: meeting tomorrow to look at TSC charger and move forward, have all the right approvals to move . | Continuing work on CII badge . | Just turned on CI across Linux/Windows/macOS, uncovered some issues, but largely pretty smooth. Gives us confidence that we’ll get more testing across Python flavors and platforms. | Lots of feedback about “why does this not install on Windows”, hopefully the CI will help with that. | Hoping to use that to draw in more contributors who use Windows primarily . | Splitting some pieces of OTIO repo into separate repos, separating language bindings and adapters / plugins into separate repos, to make it clear what the core project is responsible for, whereas other components can trail a bit, and that you can chose which components of OTIO you want to install. | Other studios are starting to create specific plugins (for instance for Hiero) that doesn’t necessarily fit into the core repo. So there’s now a “plugin template” that helps with that. | . | RAW2aces . | Kimball: pre-TSC meeting, trying to identify other people who can be involved. Discussions about re-licensing the code, splitting the repo to make clear what is data and what is code (helps with licensing) | . | . | Working Group updates . | CI . | No meeting since last TAC meeting . | Next meet agenda: moving to a project format to have more access/ visibility in CI efforts . | CI group could look into the issues reported by Larry about dependencies . | . | D&amp;I . | Carol: first webinar happening tomorrow, second one the week after, then every 2 weeks. 7 in total . | Although not target audience, everyone is welcome to attend to give feedback . | Next effort will be scholarship and ambassador programs . | . | Python 3 . | USD . | Cory: Setting up a series of demos, including Pixar Backlot . | Mike M: USD Camera Workgroup discussing schemas, creating Requirements Doc . | . | Asset Group . | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuxNSlV6fS_3km6QlwA5Z9oBhNgx_NlhZjV2jg2DrFg/edit#heading=h.4ybh7vyxdywk . | Wave: Trying to communicate with the TAC what we have been working on for the last few months . | Not going for “quantity”, going for quality. Going for production level assets, ideally from a production setting, not artificial, although have talked about one way of having an asset repo could be code that generates a sequence of OpenVDB / OpenEXR files (for instance generate EXRs with a bunch of AOVs from a 3D scene). | An organizing principle is that there should be strong alignment with the actual ASWF projects, and should either be consumed by or generated by ASWF projects. Bias towards assets that can be used by as many parts of the ASWF as possible, as well as ASWF members such as software vendors who can use these assets for their own use. | Not targeting “educational” assets for now, instead going for complex, production grade assets. | Not a “digital backlot”, not a repository of digital assets to be used in production, that already exists (both public and private repositories) . | Kimball: was there a discussion about a goal to help how to get contributions to this repo, such as listing the steps that were required for licensing / legal buyoff? Wave: yes, strawman proposal by Eric Enderton. “Make it easy for organizations to submit assets”, could be an issue if too many proposals come. Talked to Nick Cannon at WDI about the process of the Moana Island asset. The long time to produce a USD version of this asset demonstrates how complex the process can be. | There were suggestions such as camera manufacturers shooting HDR footage, talking to the ASC (suggestion at board meeting yesterday), they have a library of digital assets. But are we “a list of pointers to assets hosted somewhere else”, “a clone of existing libraries”, or “the primary hosting location”? . | TAC Project representatives should suggest what assets would be useful to their project. | Making it useful: will require people and resources. Orca is a library that NVIDIA has and makes available to researchers. Presentation from NVIDIA as to how much work is required to clean up and make assets usable. | Need a “pipeline TD” to do this work, could be a GSoC-like position? Looking at what the D&amp;I team is putting together in terms of outreach programs, could we get funding to get some kind of internship, minimal code writing (maybe some Python), but still useful project. | Trying to put together a curated set of production grade assets that would be directly useful to the projects and ASWF membership. Not targeting educational assets. Do whatever can be done to make easy for licensing and hosting. Make it clear what is desired as contributions. Asking for TAC members about opinions of what they want as assets, a wish list of “assets you with you had”. | Gordon: being able to test DCCs against these assets would be very useful. One of the things vendors find difficult is finding assets they can demo in their videos / promotional material. | Blender is working on a new short film, OTIO would like to get cuts and media, they already have pretty permissive license. | RV / Shotgun was using Big Buck Bunny as demo material for a long time. | Kimball: did we learn anything from Blender’s tutorial assets? Wave: it’s more interesting to get a dirty / crufty production asset at the end of a movie with all sorts of typical leftover “detritus” in the asset, as opposed to a carefully crafted asset for tutorial purposes. DCC vendors probably want to test against “crufty” production assets. | Josh: having assets that are clear to include in demos and presentations is really important, as opposed to just “for testing only” assets. It’s a real pain to get approval to use assets for demos. It would be very beneficial. | Josh: we also need to recognize that large studios may not want to release assets that have valuable IP associated to them . | Kimball: if ASC is working on a new STeM, we should provide that feedback to them . | Wave: multiple ways to achieve that, we could have a website that points where to find this, we could have a badging system to indicate “production level assets”, that could be the answer if we can’t actually host ourselves. But if Disney made Moana available, it is possible! . | Michael Min: early discussions motivated by Autodesk for an Asset Model, would like another 2 weeks to consolidate. Gordon: will have people working on this proposal present at the next meeting. Not meant to be an asset / library repository, but more a schema to structure asset above the raw geometry. An interesting question: what is the opportunity / overlap / relationship between that work and the asset WG work. | Wave: Intel and Amazon have a number of assets they are interested in contributing. | Wave: this is a WG, not a project, so it has a limited scope. Suggestion would be to wait until the Autodesk presentation, people will have an opportunity to comment. Can present at next TAC meeting to vote, not super clear on what the outcome should be. Need to hear from TAC members. | Eric: if the TAC approves the proposal, can present to the board, and request resources. Do we want to launch an asset repo project, derived from the work of the WG. | Open Asset Model (OAM) schema hasn’t been presented yet. | Gordon: is there some intermediate goals that can be carved out before going to the governing board. Are there some questions that can be answered before that? Wave: organize the assets by ASWF project, a clear way to organize it. Drifted a bit from that towards assets like Moana that don’t neatly fit into a single project, but could work across them. “What do we want in an ASWF asset repository”, come up with a wishlist, and “Are there any assets in ASWF member companies that could be contributed”. Also are there “recipes” that can be contributed (for instance Intel has code to generate OpenVDB test assets), doesn’t have legal / licensing issues since the assets weren’t used in a movie. | Gordon: something to be said about real production assets. We also don’t need permission to create a static site with links pointing to existing assets out there. Could we get to a real agreement that studios could sign? . | Wave: yes, that’s the first deliverable. | Eric: first thing that got agreed to in the discussions. Wave: goes back to “go back to your facilities and ask what you might agree to”. | Kimball: is there something we should vote on today? Wave: let’s let people to read the proposal, come back in 2 weeks to vote on something. | Eric: also on the Slack channel. | Gordon: OAM presentation to TAC, Kimball: will add to next agenda . | . | Rust . | First meeting as WG last Friday . | Creating Rust crates, cargo index, looking at transferring ownership to ASWF . | Cppmm should automatically C and Rust bindings . | Next meeting in two weeks: goal is to have OpenEXR have as complete bindings as possible (meeting cadence once a month) . | Larry: where does the tooling status lies? Scott: creating bindings for OpenEXR / imath is the immediate goal, tooling is mostly done. Should have automatic tooling in place. | Kimball: have a pending PR for a C library for OpenEXR . | Scott: won’t generate the C bindings for OpenEXR to avoid duplication of effort, but perhaps the tooling might help . | Kimball: C bindings will be the underlying infrastructure. C++ will be on top. | Scott: Trying to figure out how to organize ourselves . | . | . | Open Asset Model (mmin) . | Note: We’d like to delay discussing this to the next TAC meeting | . | Next meeting . | 10 March 2021 | . | .

    "content": "ASWF CI Goals for Year 3 . | Mac, Windows &amp; Linux (New focus) . | Different approaches for Mac / Windows than container based approach for Linux | . | Packaging / Distribution . | Internal studio use, and support our projects and CI | . | Testing with commercial components . | Haven’t made a lot of progress here . | Testing plugins in Houdini, Maya, Nuke (building and running tests) . | . | . New Items . | Mark Boorer to present at next meeting . | LF RelEng had regular meeting with GitHub, ability to select custom runners in GitHub Actions coming next couple of months, will get ability to select GPU builders. Will be billed against organization, how do we put cost controls against that? Not fully fleshed out yet. Giving us access to “any flavor of Azure VM”. Also more flexibility for builds that need more cores / memory (OpenVDB). Should be available next quarter. | Docker at DreamWorks Animation (Jeff Bradley) . | DreamWorks Tantalus: Using containers for artist environments . | Containers can be thought of as virtual machines . | Not used in production yet, but showing good signs . | DreamWorks feature production environment . | . | Our Feature Production Environment . | CentOS 7 . | 3-5 shows at some stage of production. ~2 in heavy production for release in next year. | Typically a set of tools is fairly stable for life of the show. Major new internal and DCC tools will be adopted only shows further out. Eg VFX 2019 tools may not be used across a show until late 2020 (depends on dept.) . | Rez (both build and run time) . | . | Goals . | Improve the software configurations for desktop software to: . | Increase new software adoption speed . | Reduce integration cost . | Increase Quality . | . | . | Goals - Quality . | Rez is helpful but not a silver bullet . | Loading libraries can be blurry between Rez packages and the system. Occasionally, we still find a tool or library running from the system, rather than the item from a rez package. | Incomplete Rez requirements are opportunities for incompatible combinations, which cause crashes in production. | . | Goals - Reduce Integration Cost . | Open source isn’t Rez compatible out of the box . | Adding a new VFX platform can take weeks due to complexities of the build systems (not counting code integration and updates) . | . | Goals - Increase Adoption Speed . | The “on my home machine…” bar. I can install on my home machine in a couple of hours. But obviously, we have the VFX matrix. | Decouple from OS, eg Move to CentOS 8, while artists still using CentOS 7 workflows. Or, move to new tools on new OS prior to studio moving the base OS. | . | Goals - Cloud . | Hey, what about this “cloud” thing? . | Ensure reproducibility of software in the cloud . | Work for all software deployments: on-prem, hybrid, cloud . | . | Approach . | Containerization Process . | Tantalus tools use Rez to determine the set of packages needed for the proper behavior of an Artist workflow. Rough Layout, in this hypothetical example. | These Rez packages re copied into a Docker image based on NVIDIA CentOS 7 image . | Federico: what is the level of granularity of Rez packages? What about libtiff? Jeff: want to try to pull as many of those into Rez packages so they can be controlled outside of the OS, and help moving to a new OS version. Ran into that issue when moving from RHEL 6 to CentOS 7, had to recompile everything just because of a new version of libtiff, big effort with a large software footprint, also creates testing / QA challenges. So trying to move to a higher level of granularity. Libtiff is clearly applicable, but what about PCRE, libz? May have to adapt over time. Federico: went that route of Rez-ifying every library, didn’t really work out, backed out to try to rely more on the CentOS base image (VFX Platform). Brent: what caused wanting to move away from Rez packages? Federico: still using Rez but not for low level libraries, ran into lots of conflicts, DCC apps would still require other versions, when AL went from CentOS 6 to CentOS 7, went back to non-Rez OS components. Aloys: create a “meta” Rez package that defines all the yum packages that the system should have. So have a CentOS 7.4 Rez package, can validate OS using Ansible. It’s not foolproof. Federico: idea is to replace this with a container. Jeff: yes, getting this far is the challenge, many say “this isn’t what Docker is for”, so can be difficult to convince people that the approach is worthwhile. Andre: using Rez at Method, using Containers for services, but haven’t put libraries in containers, assuming base libraries are part of the OS (or the container). Jeff: have to keep stability for a very long time, some depts move at different speeds, some artists use multiple applications with conflicting requirements. The right solution is likely to be different for everybody. | . | . | Approaches . | Docker Wrapper tools . | Build time . | Aggregate Rez packages . | Repair missing dependencies . | Capture Rez environment in a shell script . | Create a docker image . | . | Runtime . | A rez-like command tantalus_run rough_layout -c “launch_app -show=dragon” . | Mount interesting volumes ($HOME dir) . | Create matching UID within container . | Execute the shell script to intiialize the “Rez environment” . | Run a command or drop user on the command line . | . | “Poke holes” in the container to access license server . | Mount unavoidable volumes (assets) . | . | Results . | Performance: . | Several artist workflows showing normal behavior - performance, connectivity, etc . | Render tests within 1-2% compared to bare metal. Still investigating, shouldn’t have any drop . | Studio environment on a thumb drive. Not specifically an original goal, but great value. | Not an initial goal: how to demonstrate software at conferences, how to run software on a disconnected laptop. One of these containers could now be used for that. See value to being able to encapsulate studio environment. What about implications for low latency work from home? Yes, could be useful, but not tried yet. Also helps for projects that require “difficult” USB peripherals. | Mark: what about the “repair” phase, manual or automated? Jeff: automated process driven by configuration text files, listing additional libraries required. Per package fixes pulled in during automated phase. Currently #1 goal to fix up Rez packages, will help this project but also the whole “Rez based” studio even before containers are adopted. Discovering a lot of places where dependencies were “not quite right”, containerized environment helps to highlight problems with Rez packages that would previously “just work” in a typical environment, picking up system dependencies. | Federico: are NVIDIA drivers embedded in container? Jeff: yes, using CentOS / NVIDIA containers. Federico: any issues with sound drivers? GFX frame rate? Jeff: the 1-2% dropoff was talking about rendering performance, haven’t experimented with sound much yet. Still at early stages. GFX seems OK, seems to work OK sharing drivers with the underlying system. Audio is always a challenge. Federico: do the developers use these Docker containers to develop? . | . | Challenges . | We need to be smart and creation on the architecture and deployment design: containers come from the microservice world. We aren’t going 100% microservices for production, so many of their cool approaches to quick and agile deployments don’t apply. | Rapid adoption of changes: Rez provides a flexible environment. Containers are less flexible. Fortunately, a more deliberate approach works for our official studio policy of increasing stability and quality. Some users may be frustrated. Can we have it both ways? . | Early on a project, TDs may want to do rapid development, but once software gets into the hands of artists, want stability. | When to create images in release and adoption process? A new image with every new package is too much churn. TBD. Don’t want thousands of images lying around that won’t get used. | . | Possible Next Steps . | Clean up Rez and lower level dependency declarations . | Add “Tantalus” info into the Rez package definitions . | Leverage ASWF Docker images . | Support development environments with containers (which almost requires we solve the “Rapid adoption of changes” from the previous slide) . | Docker layers: maybe 3-4 layers for the OS, VFX Reference Platform, DCC/large app, and everything else? Performance impact of local Docker container cache vs loading across NFS (interactive startup of large application, 3-4 minutes vs 30 seconds). | . | Ryan: What about security implications of Docker installed everywhere? Jeff: In general Docker not installed on every workstation, need up to date version for GPU support. Ryan: can use Podman to address some issues, but brings some issues. Also on current CentOS 7, adds a performance hit. Federico: looking at Singularity which doesn’t have a lot of these issues, have a single executable that can be run by any user without root privileges, no performance hit. Ryan: performance issue with overlayfs version included with CentOS when using Podman. Jeff: have looked at that level of detail, have looked at Singularity which does a lot of the security “for you”, hoping to use layers more, stuck with a 12GB Singularity image. Limit of 126 layers in Docker, so can’t use “one layer per Rez package”. | . | TAC followup: Further CI-WG formalization, or a project? (Daniel) . | Daniel: discussion as how this group is positioned, want to split it out as self-contained WG. This was agreed to and is slowly happening. Kimball asked whether we should go a step further and create projects around the artefacts we are producing so we can leverage some of the processes offered to ASWF projects. Should we have a short discussion? Can discuss it on the #aswf-ci Slack channel. | Lends an opportunity to create discoverability for the scripts around the Docker images for instance (get others to contribute). Is the full “weight” of a ASWF project structure appropriate for our efforts? . | . | . Follow ups . | ASWF-docker updates (Aloys) . | VFX Platform 2021 status . | What OpenEXR versions? Aloys: not a lot of updates from last month, only small changes were for OpenCue, updated Java version, Brian was first user of PyPi distribution of aswfdocker utility, helped him with some workflows, but realized it wasn’t all the way there. Utilities to build, trigger releases. But version.yml file comes from PIP package, if you have a local modified version, need to find a way to prefer to modified local version to the one bundled with the PIP package. Need to make this logic easier so more people can download aswfdocker utility. | Tried to build OpenEXR 3, lots of activity. | Maybe a version of Docker build containers with “polluted” dependencies . | Some PRs for Windows builds. Some efforts to run Python utility on Windows, and run tests on Windows. As long as you have Docker running, as well as WSL, might be able to do some work there. Waiting to upgrade Windows version to get WSL to test. Initial goal is to build a Linux ASWF container on Windows, not a Windows container. Useful, but not the “end goal”. We should start looking again at actual Windows containers at some point (time / resources / motivation). | . | DockerHub update . | Dependency management in containers (Larry) . | OpenEXR 2 &amp; 3 . | Python 2 &amp; 3 . | Larry: noting that in OIIO there was breakage on systems that had OpenEXR iMath 3 on a system installed with OpenEXR iMath 2 (which would get found by CMake). Our Docker images are a “idealized” setup where there is only the exact versions we want. Our typical studio environments typically aren’t that ‘clean’ / ideal. Not sure there’s an action item out of this, but can get a “misleading view” of whether a build will work in a Docker environment. “Build environment fuzzing”? Don’t get me wrong, very thankful for all the work going into ASWF Docker containers. | Ryan: unsolved problem area. Most Linux distros don’t guarantee anything if you install outside the package manager. Mark: patching and maintaining on every distro is a lot of work. Daniel: other systems to hot swap from the primary system. A fair point: robustness of our software for general use, if you have functionality to find headers and libraries in our Cmake recipes, make sure you end up with a consistent set. But where does the responsibility lie? Ryan: do we have a “getting started” document for our containers? Larry: the people using our containers are the ones in a safe environment with guardrails, the issue for people trying to build in messy environments. Build systems are complicated, things turn up in the real world we don’t test against. | . | . | GPU Build &amp; Test . | Mac CI . | JFrog . | Andrew / Aloys: Looking to get an Artifactory instance set up. Andrew: when JFrog made announcement of changes to their platform, seem to have turned down their open source program. Having issues acquiring an Artifactory Cloud instance, still working on it (LF has another project that wants it), but no updates to share. | . | Project feedback . | . Action Items . ",

It’s important that conversations stays on topic in each channel, and that everyone abides by the Code of Conduct. There are thousands of members who should all expect to have a positive experience. Chat is searchable and public. Do not make comments that you would not say on a video recording or in another public space. Please be courteous to others. Slack also maintains some best practice etiquette, which has some great basic usage tips and other recommendations to best collaborate and communicate with others. Slack as a medium is best suited for short-term and synchronous conversations; long-term conversations and tracking of actions and plans are better suited for mailing lists, wikis, GitHub, and other similar mediums.

These mailing lists are hosted at groups.io and managed by the Linux Foundation staff and Academy Software Foundation community leadership. Key mailing lists . The primary mailing list for all techincal community discussion is tac@lists.aswf.io. Each hosted project and working group has its own mailing list as well, which are listed in the project listing in the TAC repo. Moderation and Moderation Guidelines . By default, TSC voting members serve as the moderator for discussions in tac@lists.aswf.io, and each hosted project’s TSC will serve as moderator for its mailing lists. Moderation privledges can be extended to others upon a vote by the TAC or respective TSC as applicable. Being a moderator is as much a privledge as it is a duty. As part of volunteering to become a moderator you are now a representative of the Academy Software Foundation community, and it is your responsibility to remain aware of your contributions in this space. These responsibilities apply to all official Academy Software Foundation channels. Moderators MUST: . | Take action as specified by these Moderator Guidelines. | You are empowered to take immediate action when there is a violation. You do not need to wait for review or approval if an egregious violation has occurred. Make a judgement call based on our Code of Conduct and Values (see below). | Removing a bad actor or content from the medium is required, do NOT let it sit there. | . | Abide by the documented tasks and actions required of moderators. | Ensure that the Code of Conduct is in effect on all official Academy Software Foundation channels. | Make yourself generally available during working hours in your time zone for moderation. This can be handled as a group so that there is enough coverage of people to allow for absences/travel. | Take care of spam as soon as possible, which may mean taking action by removing a member from that resource. | Foster a safe and productive environment by being aware of potential multiple cultural differences between community members. | Understand that you might be contacted by moderators, community managers, and other users via private email or a direct message. | Keep up with software/platform changes on the property they are responsible for. This might include new UI changes, new features, or other software changes. Moderators are encouraged to meet regularly to train themselves how to be proficient with the platform. | Report violations of the Code of Conduct to pm@aswf.io. | . Moderators SHOULD: . | Exercise compassion and empathy when communicating and collaborating with other community members. | Understand the difference between a user abusing the resource or just having difficulty expressing comments and questions in English. | Be an example and role model to others in the community. In many cases, moderators are some of the first people new contributors will interact with. | Remember to check and recognize if you need take a break when you become frustrated or find yourself in a heated debate. | Help your colleagues if you recognize them in one of the stages of burnout. | Be helpful and have fun! | . Mailing list best practices . | Review your mailing list subscriptions regularly, and either change the delivery mechanism ( such as switching from indivudual emails to daily digests ) as it makes sense to keep the signal-to-noise level reasonable for you. | Keep your comments and conversation on topic. | Recognize that with a global community and other obligations, replies aren’t instantaneous. | Refrain from cross-posting as a way to get a larger audience to your post. | . | Be sure to contact the list moderators if there are any Code of Conduct concerns. | .

These licenses are widely used and understood by both developers and organizations alike, providing flexibility for downstream usage and patent protection for those contributing code. Code License identification . Each repository must contain a license file. Include the plain-text version of the license as a LICENSE file in the top-level directory of the repostiory. All source files need to include a header to clearly show the license. ASWF recommends the use of SPDX short-form license identifiers in source code files, which vastly reduces errors in copy and pasting license text and enables the headers to be machine readable. Example of the use of SPDX short-form license identifiers can be found at https://spdx.org/ids. Copyright Notice Format . We have been recommending that contributors to a new project establish a common format for copyright notices in their own code. This can help minimize compliance burdens that might otherwise require downstream distributors to reproduce a large number of variations in years, entity names and formats for notices. We recommend a common copyright notice in a form similar to the following, which does not refer to years or specific contributing entities: . Copyright Contributors to the ____ Project. For clarity, we would not recommend removing a third party’s license or copyright notice in any circumstance. If a third party dependency is added to a repository, its license and copyright notices should be preserved and should not be modified or removed.

    "title": "Contribution sign off",
    "content": "Ensuring a clean code pedigree and lineage is critical to downstream adoption of open source code in industry. ASWF requires the use of the Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO), which is the same mechanism that the Linux® Kernel and many other communities use to manage code contributions. The DCO is considered one of the simplest tools for sign offs from contributors as the representations are meant to be easy to read and indicating signoff is done as a part of the commit message. Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO: . Signed-off-by: John Doe &lt;john.doe@example.com&gt; . You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using git commit -s. Useful tools to make doing DCO signoffs easier . There are a number of great tools out there to manage DCO signoffs for developers to make it much easier to do signoffs. | DCO command line tool, which let’s you do a single signoff for an entire repo ( https://github.com/coderanger/dco ) | GitHub UI integrations for adding the signoff automatically ( https://github.com/scottrigby/dco-gh-ui ) . | Chrome - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dco-github-ui/onhgmjhnaeipfgacbglaphlmllkpoijo | Firefox - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scott-rigby/?src=search | . | . Signoff for commits where the DCO signoff was missed . When bringing in a code repository for the first time, or commits done before the DCO checks are enabled, there would be a series of commits that don’t include the sign-off statement. You can retroactively signoff commits you’ve made by make a commit with your DCO signoff that contains a new text file ( suggested name is past_commits.txt ) with the following contents: . The following commits were made pursuant to the Developer Certificate of Origin, even though a Signed-off-by: was not included in the commit message. &lt;COMMIT HASH&gt; &lt;COMMIT MSG&gt; ... Each user who has made the past commits should have thier own Signed-off-by: line in the commit message. Contributor License Agreement (CLA) . Some projects might either have used a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) in the past (either in the form of a Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) or Individual Contributior License Agreement (ICLA)) or have considered using it. The use of a CLA is not required for open source projects and many of the use cases for CLAs are handled through the lighter weight DCO or by having an independent entity in place like the ASWF makes available. If your project does have this requirement, ASWF recommends reaching out to The Linux Foundation in advance to discuss before proposing your project to the community. The CLA templates recommended by the ASWF’s Legal Committee presently are the ASWF 2020 CCLA template and ASWF 2020 ICLA template. These are derived from the Apache Software Foundation’s CCLA and ICLA template, and contain substantively the same scope of license grants and requirements. The changes are intended to reflect ASWF entities rather than Apache Software Foundation as the project host, and to include administrative changes for ASWF’s use of the EasyCLA tool to manage authorized contributors under signed CLAs.

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "content": "Q: What if the project I want to propose is not under an Apache License, Version 2.0, Community Data License Agreement (CDLA) license or Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License? . A: Some projects may be able to relicense to the Apache License, Version 2.0 for their codebase, a Community Data License Agreement (CDLA) license for any data sets, and the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License for all documentation and non-code assets. If this can be easily done by one entity with the appropriate rights, this is our preferred approach. Projects with a history of contributions from multiple parties may not be able to easily relicense. Where another OSI-approved license is in place, the project may be proposed under its existing license and may be accepted without license change. Use of a license not approved by the ASWF does not preclude you from making a proposal but be sure in your project proposal to address the anticipated challenges relicensing the project. Q: Does the use of a particular open source license require the use of a CLA? . A: No common open source license requires the use of a CLA. Most open source projects do not use a CLA. Some critical projects do use CLAs, often to ensure contributions and grants made under the license are backed by the company employing developers making those contributions. Q: If a project already uses a particular CLA, can the CLA be changed or deprecated? . A: Yes. Q: Can umbrella CLAs be established where contributors and their organizations grant rights to all ASWF projects? . A: The ASWF TAC sees value in lowering the friction to contribution, and is investigating this as an option as the number of hosted projects grows. In the meantime, projects aligning around the ASWF 2020 CCLA template and ASWF 2020 ICLA template will ensure that the legal review for signing a CCLA and/or ICLA is minimal. Q: When a project uses a CLA with the Apache License, Version 2.0, is it common for ASF Contributor Agreements to be employed? Should ASWF projects that require a CLA and use the Apache License, Version 2.0 employ the Apache CLA or the LF minimal CLA? . A: There is no requirement for a project to adopt ASF Contributor Agreements with code licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. Many open source projects leverage the Apache License, Version 2.0 without using ASF Contributor Agreements or sometimes without a CLA in general (in many cases use of the DCO alone is sufficent for project communities). The ASWF community is aiming to align around the ASWF 2020 CCLA template and ASWF 2020 ICLA template in cases where use of a CLA is required. Projects may also use the Linux Foundation minimal CCLA template and Linux Foundation minimal ICLA template. ",

However, questions about e.g. whether a license is legally okay to use must be directed to the contributor’s own legal counsel and/or a project’s Legal Committee. | The support program utilizes various automated tools supplemented by manual reviews. However, like any other scanning tool or process, the LF cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the license scanning results, and does not guarantee that all possible license issues in a scanned codebase will be identified. | . Dependencies on other LF and project teams . | Will periodically need assistance from project manager or similar project staff support, to coordinate on preferred methods for communications with appropriate project community members. | May periodically need LF IT assistance for configuring certain types of scans, for those that are dependent of CI/CD processes that are managed by LF IT (none presently anticipated for current projects / scan types) . | .

In the case of projects with established trademarks where a trademark transfer is commercially difficult, we generally recommend the project use a new name upon incubation. | Obtain an affirmative vote of the TAC. | . An initial review of a proposal submitted to the TAC should be conducted within two to four weeks following acceptance of a project contribution proposal.

A: As TSC members are individuals within the context of a TSC, it’s expected that all their actions are for the general good of the project itself.

A good way to do this is by reviewing the ASWF calendar, which maintains a list of all community meetings. ASWF Zoom meetings are provisioned with the following settings set to maximize security yet make community access to meetings have a fairly low barrier to entry: . | ‘Only authenticated users can join meetings’ set on | ‘Require password for participants joining by phone’ set on | ‘Identify guest participants in the meeting/webinar’ set on | Only the host can share their screen. | If the meeting is for a closed group, a password will be required to join ( which will be encoded in the URL to join the meeting that can be shared over a private channel ) | . Do not share your Zoom link on social media. This will help curtail trolls and others who would intentionally attempt to disrupt your Zoom call. To join the provisioned meeting and become host . | Have the latest version of the Zoom client installed. | Open the meeting in the Zoom desktop client | Use the host key to “claim host”. | Assign a co-host to help with moderation. It should never be your note taker unless it’s a very small group. | If you have others that need to share their screen, the host can enable that on the fly. (via the ^ menu next to Share Screen) | If you know that there will only be a fixed number of attendees at a meeting, lock the meeting to prevent anyone new from joining ( Click ‘Manage Participants’, then at the bottom of the Particpants list click More and then Lock Meeting ) | . Moderation . If you’re dealing with a troll or bad actor: . | Put the troll or bad actor on hold. The participant will be put into a “waiting room” and will not be able to participate in the call until the host removes the hold. | Remove the participant. Please be cautious when testing or using this feature, as it is permanent. They will never be able to come back into that meeting ID on that particular device. Do not joke around with this feature; it’s better to put the attendee on “hold” first and then remove. | After an action has been taken, use the lock meeting feature so that no one else can come into the meeting. If that fails, end the call immediately, and contact the ASWF Program Manager to report the issue. | . NOTE: You can find these actions when clicking on the more or “…“ options after scrolling over the participants name/information.

There are some things that are just plain out of your control, but there are some things that you can control. Here are some tips if you’re just getting into remote meetings. Keep in mind that sometimes things just break. These are not hard rules, more of a set of loose guidelines on how to tip the odds in your favor. Recommended hardware to have . | A dedicated microphone - This is the number one upgrade you can do. Sound is one of those things that can immediately change the quality of your call. If you plan on being here for the long haul, something like a Blue Yeti will work great due to the simplicity of using USB audio and having a hardware mute button. Consider a pop filter as well if necessary. | A Video Camera - A bad image can be worked around if the audio is good. Certain models have noise cancelling dual-microphones, which are a great backup for a dedicated microphone or if you are travelling. | A decent set of headphones - Personal preference, these cut down on the audio feedback when in larger meetings. | . What about an integrated headset and microphone? This totally depends on the type. We recommend testing it with a friend or asking around for recommendations for which models work best. Hardware we don’t recommend . | Earbuds. Generally speaking they are not ideal, and while they might sound fine to you when 50 people are on a call the ambient noise adds up. Some people join with earbuds and it sounds excellent, others join and it sounds terrible. Practicing with someone ahead of time can help you determine how well your earbuds work. | . Pro-tips . | If you join the meeting via the desktop or web client, make sure your name is set correctly so other attendees know who you are ( especially the person taking meeting notes! ). | Join on muted audio and video in order to prevent noise to those already in a call. | If you don’t have anything to say at that moment, MUTE. This is a common problem. You can help out a teammate by mentioning it on Zoom chat or asking them to mute on the call itself. The meeting co-host can help with muting noisly attendees before it becomes too disruptive. Don’t feel bad if this happens to you, it’s a common occurrence. | Try to find a quiet meeting place to join from; some coworking spaces and coffee shops have a ton of ambient noise that won’t be obvious to you but will be to other people in the meeting. When presenting to large groups consider delegating to another person who is in a quieter environment. | Using your computer’s built in microphone and speakers might work in a pinch, but in general won’t work as well as a dedicated headset/microphone. | Consider using visual signals to agree to points so that you don’t have to mute/unmute often during a call. This can be an especially useful technique when people are asking for lazy consensus. A simple thumbs up can go a long way! | It is common for people to step on each other when there’s an audio delay, and both parties are trying to communicate something. Don’t worry, just remember to try and pause before speaking, or consider raising your hand (if your video is on) to help the host determine who should speak first. | .
